POD1000000005_S0000007	i have a dream to realize for american dream
POD1000000005_S0000008	after settling in los angeles the korean born kim did the immigrant hustle
POD1000000005_S0000009	working all kinds of jobs he delivered laundry sold cars finally he landed a gig working in the city is korean american apparel industry which locals call the jobber market
POD1000000005_S0000010	i have an uncle who has one fabric company in korea
POD1000000005_S0000011	he always exported fabric to the united states
POD1000000005_S0000012	then he recommended to go to the java area and get a job in fabric sales force
POD1000000005_S0000013	so i followed his advice
POD1000000005_S0000014	his uncle is advice paid off kim worked for a decade selling fabric
POD1000000005_S0000015	then in 2000 he and his wife started a garment business of their own
POD1000000005_S0000016	they called it trebien
POD1000000005_S0000017	and they sold
POD1000000005_S0000018	fashion basic
POD1000000005_S0000019	fashion basic
POD1000000005_S0000020	can wear anytime and anywhere
POD1000000005_S0000021	kim is company sold a bunch of wholesale separates t shirts sweaters little skirts and such to clothing boutiques
POD1000000005_S0000022	and all of it was made right there in la is garment district where we visited mister kim in traybien is showroom
POD1000000005_S0000023	i always say to my customers i have a usa background made in usa is daddy is friend
POD1000000005_S0000024	in the early days of tribune when cam and his wife were still chasing their american dream they got an order from a small clothing boutique run by another korean couple
POD1000000005_S0000025	it was called forever 21
POD1000000005_S0000026	kim happily supplied them with clothes until one day .
POD1000000005_S0000027	they cut me out and about 18 years ago
POD1000000005_S0000029	they cut you out
POD1000000005_S0000030	yeah
POD1000000005_S0000031	why
POD1000000005_S0000032	because their business system is not matched with mine
POD1000000005_S0000033	basically here is what went down kim got a complaint from the warehouse the sleeves on one of the 3 quarter tops he sold them were a quarter inch too long
POD1000000005_S0000034	kim was not down with the critique
POD1000000005_S0000035	i am not taylor i said i told him i am not taylor
POD1000000005_S0000036	and you can guess how that went over
POD1000000005_S0000037	he told me that he cannot do business if i said like that
POD1000000005_S0000038	so i said okay let us start the business that is it
POD1000000005_S0000040	had kim known that the company he was mouthing off to would grow to become one of the largest fast fashion clothing brands in the world perhaps he would have fixed that quarter inch whoopsies
POD1000000005_S0000041	that little extra bit of sleeve cost him a slice of his american dream
POD1000000005_S0000042	for 18 years i could not get any order
POD1000000005_S0000044	and i regret it
POD1000000005_S0000046	did you say you regret
POD1000000005_S0000047	yeah i regret until last year
POD1000000005_S0000049	because their order was huge
POD1000000005_S0000050	a lot of folks from the korean jobber market made a lot of money off of forever 21
POD1000000005_S0000051	the teen brand is synonymous with $3 camisoles nonsensical graphic tees and festival wear for people who will never make it to coachella
POD1000000005_S0000052	but in the end maybe it is okay that kim did not hitch his wagon to the clothing giant
POD1000000005_S0000053	forever 21 is rise to fast fashion dominance was dizzying
POD1000000005_S0000054	with the brand is unbridled expansion mom and pop management approach and weak e commerce game set it up to fall hard
POD1000000005_S0000055	despite those $4.99 leggings
POD1000000005_S0000056	i am lauren ober and from american public media this is spectacular failures the show that looks cute even though failure is always trying to jack our style
POD1000000005_S0000058	there is a neighborhood in los angeles about 3 miles west of downtown that is the beating heart of the city is korean community
POD1000000005_S0000059	it has got everything korean karaoke bars and korean barbecue joints boba tea shops and banks
POD1000000005_S0000060	there is also like beauty treatment beauty makeup the spas
POD1000000005_S0000062	i mean you do have amazing skin
POD1000000005_S0000064	so
POD1000000005_S0000065	i accept i am not sure if i .
POD1000000005_S0000066	i came to get a tour of the neighborhood from heypin m
POD1000000005_S0000067	she is a leader in the korean community here
POD1000000005_S0000068	she runs faith and community empowerment which is a local nonprofit
POD1000000005_S0000069	come this way
POD1000000005_S0000071	this neighborhood is by koreans for koreans
POD1000000005_S0000072	though a hefty number of non koreans come for the aforementioned spas and the k pop shops and the mouth numbing kimchi
POD1000000005_S0000073	so it is really for us it is kind of like the political social headquarter or center for our community
POD1000000005_S0000074	and also cretetown la in essence is the headquarter for korean america usa
POD1000000005_S0000075	los angeles has the largest korean community of any city in the u s
POD1000000005_S0000076	but because of language and cultural barriers im says her community has often felt isolated
POD1000000005_S0000077	this neighborhood though is a home base
POD1000000005_S0000078	but in essence as a korean american knowing there is koreatown and all the people that i have been able to meet because this space allows our communities to come together and to be visible i do not feel alone
POD1000000005_S0000079	i wanted to better understand how this place with its tight knit korean churches and its ever youthful k beauty boutiques birthed one of the largest fast fashion brands in the world
POD1000000005_S0000081	after the u s and korea established official diplomatic ties in 1882 the 1st wave of korean immigration began to roll in
POD1000000005_S0000082	1st to hawaii then to los angeles
POD1000000005_S0000083	it was followed by a 2nd surge after the korean war
POD1000000005_S0000084	the watts riots of 1965 pushed a lot of koreans to the la suburbs
POD1000000005_S0000085	but the number of new arrivals to the city from south korea continued to grow thanks to a loosening of immigration laws
POD1000000005_S0000086	by the time m arrived in the u s in 1974 the community was already on the way up
POD1000000005_S0000087	thanks to some hustling by a few local korean businessmen koreatown got its own official blue neighborhood signs in 1980
POD1000000005_S0000088	so there was kind of that signage
POD1000000005_S0000089	although already there was the church and the grocery stores you know started to anchor the rest of the community right and the restaurant
POD1000000005_S0000090	just after koreatown became legit a couple named dohwan and jinsuk chang emigrated from seoul
POD1000000005_S0000091	they came in search of the same thing our pal dj kim was after the american dream
POD1000000005_S0000092	in south korea mister chang ran a coffee and juice delivery business
POD1000000005_S0000093	missus chang was a hairdresser when they moved to l a they took a series of menial jobs to make ends meet
POD1000000005_S0000094	mister chang has talked about how he worked as a gas station attendant and
POD1000000005_S0000095	he did janitorial work
POD1000000005_S0000096	that is sapna maheshwari she is a business reporter at the new york times
POD1000000005_S0000097	the legend has it that he was working at a gas station and as he saw people with these really nice cars he would always ask them what they did
POD1000000005_S0000098	and he noticed the people with the nicest cars worked in the garment industry
POD1000000005_S0000099	okay now i would think that the people with the nicest cars in la were like jack nicholson and mel gibson but what do i know
POD1000000005_S0000100	for some reason the garment trade just became fixed in mister chang is mind so he and his wife went for it
POD1000000005_S0000101	the 2 of them put together their savings and they decided to open a store that was 1st called fashion 21
POD1000000005_S0000102	and they figured out with the garment manufacturing in los angeles how to deliver fashions that people wanted and to come up with a way of selling clothes that churn through styles made an exciting environment
POD1000000005_S0000103	and really created the type of place where you had to come in to see what was new
POD1000000005_S0000104	now this might not seem very revolutionary
POD1000000005_S0000105	especially today when consumers can get knockoffs of the latest luxury fashions seemingly before the models have strutted off the catwalk
POD1000000005_S0000106	but in the 80s that was not really how fashion was done
POD1000000005_S0000107	they hit on something as happens in retail they hit upon a formula that resonated with shoppers and they quickly became a success
POD1000000005_S0000108	in 1984 the changs opened fashion 21 a 900 square foot boutique in the heart of the highland park neighborhood
POD1000000005_S0000109	they packed it with cheap skimpy teen clothes that they bought from la is korean american garment manufacturers like the kind mister kim sold
POD1000000005_S0000110	i think one of the things that definitely helped them was the fact that they were in los angeles and took advantage of the other korean american garment manufacturers in that city specifically
POD1000000005_S0000111	so i think that very much was a propeller of their success
POD1000000005_S0000112	remember the jobber market
POD1000000005_S0000113	java j 0 b b e r java market
POD1000000005_S0000114	kim explains that the jobber market came about around 35 years ago with the arrival of korean immigrants from south america
POD1000000005_S0000115	he came from bolivia many of the other folks had worked in brazil in that country is massive garment industry and they all brought that experience with them to l a
POD1000000005_S0000116	they bought wholesale clothes out garments and went to work opening their own stores
POD1000000005_S0000117	people started to sell dead merchandise
POD1000000005_S0000118	but the people come from brazil they started manufacturing their own brand of pearls
POD1000000005_S0000119	by the time the changs got to la the korean american apparel industry was already in full swing
POD1000000005_S0000120	the couple worked with manufacturers in the jabra market to fill up fashion 21 with inexpensive styles that could be turned over quickly
POD1000000005_S0000122	my producer whitney and i decided to see where it all began
POD1000000005_S0000123	so we took a trip to 5637 north figueroa street and cruised around the shop for a bit
POD1000000005_S0000125	the sign on the front of the building still reads fashion 21 an homage to its humble roots
POD1000000005_S0000126	but it is a forever 21 store through and through
POD1000000005_S0000127	see styles from one body suits
POD1000000005_S0000129	you can buy a suit in there for 8 bucks if you want
POD1000000005_S0000130	i have got all the body suits i need right now
POD1000000005_S0000131	well that is debatable
POD1000000005_S0000132	we pop inside and it looks pretty classy
POD1000000005_S0000133	like maybe it is more for adults than teens
POD1000000005_S0000134	we head to a rack of graphic tees and i am kind of into them
POD1000000005_S0000135	i mean i would 100% wear that actually
POD1000000005_S0000137	bad shoe
POD1000000005_S0000138	if they had that in like a large i would totally wear that
POD1000000005_S0000139	can not stop will not stop
POD1000000005_S0000140	well that is right you can not step on stuff
POD1000000005_S0000141	alas we left empty handed no $8 bodysuits for whitney
POD1000000005_S0000143	if the fashion 21 store on figueroa was representative of what the changs business was in the early days it seems like it would have been a nice little life for them
POD1000000005_S0000144	in its 1st year the store pulled in $70
POD1000000005_S0000145	and that was largely thanks to other korean immigrants
POD1000000005_S0000146	but then they realized how successful this business model was
POD1000000005_S0000147	and they started opening new stores
POD1000000005_S0000148	that is ludovica cesario she is a marketing professor at lehigh university
POD1000000005_S0000149	they then changed the name to forever 21 with the idea that they are selling clothes for anyone who wants to be trendy or fresh or just young more generally
POD1000000005_S0000150	this business model selling cheap trendy clothes that could be manufactured quickly and turned over frequently so the stores always felt new and fresh that was the chang is secret weapon
POD1000000005_S0000151	today we call this approach fast fashion and lots of global brands do it h m zara and asos to name a few
POD1000000005_S0000152	but forever 21 perfected it
POD1000000005_S0000153	for a definition of fast fashion here is the washington post fashion critic i am sorry the pulitzer prize winning fashion critic robin gavon
POD1000000005_S0000154	i mean it is generally clothing that is produced very quickly very much leaping onto a trend of the moment and not meant to last
POD1000000005_S0000155	meaning the design is not meant to last or the clothing is not meant to last
POD1000000005_S0000156	both the idea is that if you want to participate in a trend in a fad and one that is most likely a fleeting fad fast fashion allows you to glom onto that as soon as possible
POD1000000005_S0000157	it allows you to grasp it for minimal cost
POD1000000005_S0000158	wear it a few times
POD1000000005_S0000159	savor the moment literally the moment and then move on
POD1000000005_S0000160	and fast fashion trades in fomo says cesario
POD1000000005_S0000161	there is this almost fear of missing out that if you do not go to the store as soon as the shipment arrives you might not be able to find that product in your size
POD1000000005_S0000162	and so it creates this sense of urgency basically in consumers to want to make them keep coming back to the store
POD1000000005_S0000163	that and insanely cheap prices
POD1000000005_S0000164	leg clothes for under $10 a piece
POD1000000005_S0000165	this business model plus a manageable number of stores meant that the chang is operation was profitable and everything was pretty decent
POD1000000005_S0000166	but the changs were not interested in pretty decent
POD1000000005_S0000167	they were chasing their big bold american dream
POD1000000005_S0000168	i think that mister chang at least in this period where he started expanding into department stores
POD1000000005_S0000169	also thought that forever 21 could be more than where college girls got a new outfit for saturday night
POD1000000005_S0000170	he thought that maybe they could be a place where the whole family could be outfitted with
POD1000000005_S0000171	where you would really trust this store to provide you with a lot of the clothing for your everyday life
POD1000000005_S0000173	12 miles from the 1st forever 21 property is the beverly center a sprawling shopping mall that one angeleno told me is quote one of the most hated malls in la
POD1000000005_S0000174	it is more than 80 square feet of prada fendi and balenciaga
POD1000000005_S0000175	tucked into a corner on level 8 is xxi forever which i guess is forever 21 but make it luxury
POD1000000005_S0000176	the store occupies more than an acre of real estate and is not meant for people over a certain age
POD1000000005_S0000177	it is bright and loud and the seemingly never ending selection of clothes is disorienting
POD1000000005_S0000178	honestly i felt like i needed a xanax and a nap after we visited
POD1000000005_S0000179	but this was what the changs were after they were planting their flag with huge stores and fancy malls
POD1000000005_S0000180	this was their american dream realized
POD1000000005_S0000181	and they built it largely on top of the ashes of fallen retailers
POD1000000005_S0000182	it was really in the early 2000s that you saw them sort of burst onto the national scene and that really emerged with the acquisition of stores owned by gadzooks
POD1000000005_S0000183	do you remember that retailer
POD1000000005_S0000184	gadzooks was a teen clothing company with 100s of stores and malls across the u s
POD1000000005_S0000185	in 2004 it filed for bankruptcy
POD1000000005_S0000186	and so there is all these stores and other assets that were up for purchase and forever 21 bid on those successfully
POD1000000005_S0000187	and with that they really expanded their store base and also became a national player in a whole new way
POD1000000005_S0000188	in 2005 forever 21 began a period of mind blowing expansion
POD1000000005_S0000189	when mall chains like mervyn is and sears and others were toppling under their own weight forever 21 was snatching up their scraps
POD1000000005_S0000190	when the global recession hit in 2008 chang is looked at it as an opportunity to push even harder
POD1000000005_S0000191	nothing like hitting the gas when your competitors are slamming into the guardrails
POD1000000005_S0000192	by 2011 forever 21 had almost 500 stores around the country and employed 35000 people
POD1000000005_S0000193	within just a few years after that the company had expanded to 47 countries
POD1000000005_S0000194	so that meant that tweens in the philippines or romania or macau could all rock a boxy shirred flounce cuff top or leopard drawstring lounge shorts for less than the price of a movie ticket
POD1000000005_S0000195	2015 was forever 21 is peak
POD1000000005_S0000196	it did $440 in sales that year
POD1000000005_S0000197	which means that they sold a hell of a lot of $10 mini dresses and bralettes and whatever dolphin shorts are
POD1000000005_S0000198	but even though forever 21 had grown into a multi $10 business the changs ran it like a mom and pop operation
POD1000000005_S0000199	they owned 99% of the company and had never taken on investors which meant that there was and i can not stress this enough no real board of directors they had to run decisions by
POD1000000005_S0000200	or at least not in the traditional sense
POD1000000005_S0000201	the board consisted of mister chang one of his daughters and another forever 21 executive
POD1000000005_S0000202	they felt that they were building something of an empire they were in charge mister and missus chang were in charge and they were going to pass this business on to their daughters
POD1000000005_S0000203	and it was only going to grow and become bigger
POD1000000005_S0000204	the fact that they owned everything also meant that there is not much publicly available information about the company
POD1000000005_S0000205	and the family is not real into talking to the press
POD1000000005_S0000206	they 100% would not talk to us for the story though we did reach out
POD1000000005_S0000207	what we do know is that mister chang oversaw business operations and strategy while missus chang ran the merchandising side of things one floor below their adult daughters linda and esther served as their deputies
POD1000000005_S0000208	they kind of oversaw their own fiefdoms within the forever 21 business
POD1000000005_S0000209	mister chang had to review every single real estate contract and was involved with the opening of every new store which at the pace that they were expanding is a huge responsibility
POD1000000005_S0000210	missus chang had her own hands full
POD1000000005_S0000211	overseeing 1000s and 1000s of styles and garments and approving each of those individually before they appeared in stores
POD1000000005_S0000212	i mean in many ways it is flabbergasting that these 2 people could have taken on this amount of responsibility especially at a company of this size
POD1000000005_S0000213	one minute they would be overseeing new real estate purchases or clothing designs and the next minute they would be approving expenses for business lunches or ubers
POD1000000005_S0000214	which seems like the very definition of micromanaging
POD1000000005_S0000215	no billionaire ceos are approving timesheets or even what buttons or zippers should be used on new designs
POD1000000005_S0000216	kevin fagans was forever 21 is global communications director during the time of the brand is rapid international expansion
POD1000000005_S0000217	he says while having your hand in every pot might not be the most efficient way to run a business it did mean that the changs knew what their brand was all about
POD1000000005_S0000218	well i think the one thing they understood was brand personality
POD1000000005_S0000219	so they knew their customer incredibly well
POD1000000005_S0000220	you know knowing and at least i say that domestically i mean in the us they knew who she was
POD1000000005_S0000221	they knew what she liked
POD1000000005_S0000222	they knew when she wanted things
POD1000000005_S0000223	so it is like back to school it is christmas
POD1000000005_S0000224	it is our holiday it is festival season which is huge obviously
POD1000000005_S0000225	while it is important to understand product and who is buying it it is equally important to understand the market you are operating in
POD1000000005_S0000226	i think the challenge with running and operating a global business is that seasonality has changed
POD1000000005_S0000227	cultural mindsets change
POD1000000005_S0000228	so you know what the french customer wants the german customer does not
POD1000000005_S0000229	you know what someone in australia is weighing well 1st of all they are counter seasonal
POD1000000005_S0000230	so you know it is when you are shipping that product you can not ship them coats in january right
POD1000000005_S0000231	in forever 21 is race to global domination they spread themselves too thin
POD1000000005_S0000232	with nearly 800 stores worldwide they could not really manage all those physical spaces
POD1000000005_S0000233	now if you know anything about retail trends you will know this managing 10s of square feet of retail space is a mega challenge in the age of the internet

POD1000000005_S0000277	in order to better understand how one of the world is biggest fast fashion brands fell apart i decided to go to the source a teen girl
POD1000000005_S0000278	eden goldbloom is a 16 year old high school junior who lives just outside of washington d c
POD1000000005_S0000279	she used to shop at forever 21 a lot she said until they quote stopped being cute
POD1000000005_S0000280	they are cheap they are not in good shape they break fast and some of them are really tacky
POD1000000005_S0000281	we are on our way to montgomery mall right outside of dc
POD1000000005_S0000282	explain explain what that means to me explain
POD1000000005_S0000283	and then you will see like a normal shirt and then you will turn it around and it says something like weird on it
POD1000000005_S0000285	and it is surreal to support them
POD1000000005_S0000286	before i go into the 3rd forever 21 of this story i issued a challenge
POD1000000005_S0000287	each of us had to find one cute thing to buy
POD1000000005_S0000288	but after many minutes of browsing the enormous store .
POD1000000005_S0000289	i do not think i can do the challenge
POD1000000005_S0000290	i do not think i can do the challenge either
POD1000000005_S0000291	because it is overwhelming actually
POD1000000005_S0000292	okay
POD1000000005_S0000293	now it makes sense that i could not find anything cute for me
POD1000000005_S0000294	i mean the store is not called forever 41
POD1000000005_S0000295	but it should trouble the company that a member of its target demographic can not find anything she likes in a store the size of a mcmansion
POD1000000005_S0000296	okay some basic .
POD1000000005_S0000298	it is like a normal material
POD1000000005_S0000299	yeah
POD1000000005_S0000300	finally after some serious hunting eden landed on the one thing in the entire store she would wear
POD1000000005_S0000301	alright
POD1000000005_S0000302	you can hold on to that
POD1000000005_S0000303	alright
POD1000000005_S0000304	then it was up to me to find something i liked
POD1000000005_S0000305	i tried on a crop windbreaker and that went about as well as could be expected
POD1000000005_S0000306	it is very snug around here is it supposed to fit like this
POD1000000005_S0000308	hey guys i am just going to go out for a jog and then i am going to go to the club afterwards
POD1000000005_S0000309	finally i landed on my item a plain black baseball cap with the words dangerous but fun written on the crown
POD1000000005_S0000310	dangerous but fun
POD1000000005_S0000311	dangerous but fun
POD1000000005_S0000312	i think you should get that
POD1000000005_S0000313	do you think i should
POD1000000005_S0000314	i think you should
POD1000000005_S0000315	do you think
POD1000000005_S0000316	now i can tell you that i looked neither dangerous nor fun
POD1000000005_S0000317	but i bought the hat and eden bought the little skirt and we both fulfilled our forever 21 challenge
POD1000000005_S0000318	great job us
POD1000000005_S0000319	are we done though
POD1000000005_S0000320	are we done zel
POD1000000005_S0000321	do you feel like we are done zara
POD1000000005_S0000322	i feel like we are done so
POD1000000005_S0000323	we were donezo
POD1000000005_S0000324	i left forever 21 $15.50 lighter and perhaps more confused than i had been before about how the brand is business model could possibly make sense
POD1000000005_S0000325	there were hardly any shoppers in any of the stores i went to and those who were there seemed more like old millennials than general z tastemakers
POD1000000005_S0000326	i could not figure out what this giant store was all about
POD1000000005_S0000327	or how fast fashion is even supposed to work
POD1000000005_S0000328	i figured robin gavon could help
POD1000000005_S0000329	in addition to reporting on the runways of paris and new york givhan often writes about what fashion says about how we live now
POD1000000005_S0000330	and she thinks a lot about fast fashion and its impact on our culture esthetically socially and environmentally
POD1000000005_S0000331	surprisingly she is not totally down on fast fashion
POD1000000005_S0000332	i do think that fast fashion has kind of allowed everyone to have access to esthetically thoughtful clothing
POD1000000005_S0000333	does not mean we are all dressing better though
POD1000000005_S0000334	notice i said to have access to it
POD1000000005_S0000336	in a way gavon says fast fashion is kind of brilliant when it is done right
POD1000000005_S0000337	for the vast majority of people they are not going into the designer boutique
POD1000000005_S0000338	they are going into a department store or a mass merchant
POD1000000005_S0000339	and you know those stores look at trend reports and they look at what is on the runway and part of their great skill in both marketing and manufacturing is being able to take those ideas and turn them around at just a rapid fire pace and get them into stores
POD1000000005_S0000340	and there is not just one delivery that happens at the beginning of a season no no
POD1000000005_S0000341	it is a constant stream of newness
POD1000000005_S0000342	and when i say constant i mean like every 2 weeks for some of these places
POD1000000005_S0000343	so gavon says that at its best fast fashion means that new stylish clothes are not just for fancies with the cash to shop haute couture
POD1000000005_S0000344	but i am going to let you in on a little secret
POD1000000005_S0000345	it is impossible for clothing designers to go from original idea to brand spanking new product on the rack in 2 weeks
POD1000000005_S0000346	especially not at the volume that forever 21 needed to fill all of their bazillion stores
POD1000000005_S0000347	so the company had to find some shortcuts
POD1000000005_S0000348	copying other designers ideas was part of forever 21 is business model from the beginning
POD1000000005_S0000349	susan scafidi is the founder of the fashion law institute at fordham university and she basically invented the field of fashion law
POD1000000005_S0000350	and she will be the 1st one to tell you that while forever 21 is practice of copying other designers ideas is not a cute look it is generally totally legal
POD1000000005_S0000351	fashion is not recognized as an art form in the united states
POD1000000005_S0000352	so it does not get copyright protection in large part because a 100 years ago the copyright office decided that fashion no matter how fanciful was utilitarian
POD1000000005_S0000353	only a couple areas of fashion are protected from copying
POD1000000005_S0000354	we have a tiny bit of copyright protection at least since the 1960s for 2 dimensional elements of fashion things like fabric prints or lace designs
POD1000000005_S0000355	over on the patent side we have had historically a little bit of protection for some functional elements of fashion things like zippers and velcro and kevlar and space suits or hazmat suits
POD1000000005_S0000356	and then at the end of the day what fashion really has to rely on is trademark protection
POD1000000005_S0000357	that is protection for the logo or label
POD1000000005_S0000358	so basically the polo pony on your chest or the giant double g on your belt buckle those are protected
POD1000000005_S0000359	the design of the shirt and belt themselves are not original prints are generally also protected
POD1000000005_S0000360	while there are not a ton of copyright and trademark protections for fashion in the us
POD1000000005_S0000361	forever 21 has still found itself involved in many many many intellectual property lawsuits scafidi says they are one of the most egregious offenders in the game
POD1000000005_S0000362	gucci puma adidas anna sui diane von furstenberg and gwen stefani have all pursued legal action against forever 21 alleging various forms of copyright infringement
POD1000000005_S0000363	many smaller brands have also claimed their prints or designs were ripped off by the mega retailer
POD1000000005_S0000364	but most did not have the resources to go against a multi $10 mammoth
POD1000000005_S0000365	and scafidi says fast fashion brands like forever 21 bank on that
POD1000000005_S0000366	a certain amount of copying is baked into the business model of every fashion company
POD1000000005_S0000367	the only question is how literally they are copying and how much they are changing it up
POD1000000005_S0000368	in forever 21 is case they would often barely bother to change anything about the original design they were ripping off
POD1000000005_S0000369	and some of their fabric prints were just a straight cut and copy job
POD1000000005_S0000370	and maybe on the back end you get caught and have to pay out the occasional settlement or pay some legal fees
POD1000000005_S0000371	but usually that is cheaper than actually hiring designers and engaging in innovative product research
POD1000000005_S0000372	copying clothing designs has not been forever 21 is only questionable move
POD1000000005_S0000373	in 2001 a workers advocacy center filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees who said they were made to work insane hours for way less than minimum wage
POD1000000005_S0000374	in 2012 the u s department of labor sued the retailer for failing to pay federal minimum wage to its manufacturers and contractors
POD1000000005_S0000375	and in 2019 pop star ariana grande slapped forever 21 with a $10 lawsuit
POD1000000005_S0000376	the company used a model in this ad campaign that looked an awful lot like ariana grande
POD1000000005_S0000377	she claims they did this to confuse consumers that she had endorsed them
POD1000000005_S0000378	and that ariana grande look alike was me just kidding
POD1000000005_S0000379	a behemoth like forever 21 rarely fails because of one misstep
POD1000000005_S0000380	how did it falter let us count the ways
POD1000000005_S0000381	how about routine legal troubles leasing too much expensive retail space screwy merchandising that gummed up their supply chain and no traditional board of directors to pump the brakes
POD1000000005_S0000382	and with retail moving more and more online forever 21 is weak e commerce game did not help matters
POD1000000005_S0000383	in recent years there has been one other major issue tugging at forever 21 is fallacy hem sustainability because sustainable it aint
POD1000000005_S0000384	i wonder is fast fashion if we are talking about sustainability like is that just as bad as it can get
POD1000000005_S0000385	well i am hesitant to say the worst but i would be hard pressed to think of another realm of the fashion industry that is as bad
POD1000000005_S0000386	because fast fashion has as its fundamental purpose
POD1000000005_S0000387	quick disposability
POD1000000005_S0000388	you know the $25 handbag that is a knockoff of some you know item that came down the runway
POD1000000005_S0000389	that is really meant to be used for a few months and then chucked into the trash well that is going to end up in a landfill
POD1000000005_S0000390	as opposed to say an hermes handbag that is the price of a small car
POD1000000005_S0000391	that is not getting tossed out
POD1000000005_S0000392	that is going in a safe deposit box as insurance for the apocalypse
POD1000000005_S0000393	sustainability in fashion is not just about buying more durable classic handbags
POD1000000005_S0000394	the rise of online consignment shopping as well as clothing rental startups like rent the runway means consumers are increasingly trying to buy used and own less stuff
POD1000000005_S0000395	a clothing brand that banks on disposability is not long for this new world
POD1000000005_S0000396	by september 2019 it had all become just too much for forever 21
POD1000000005_S0000397	the company built by immigrants from a single storefront in la into a $40 colossus filed for bankruptcy
POD1000000005_S0000398	it is the end of an era
POD1000000005_S0000399	if you are a fan of forever 21 you may have to say goodbye to a store near you
POD1000000005_S0000400	over the weekend the retailer filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy all this in hopes of salvaging the company is brand
POD1000000005_S0000401	naturally the internet was abuzz at the news
POD1000000005_S0000402	tons of youtubers raced out to forever 21 shops to get some deals deals deals and naturally they made videos
POD1000000005_S0000403	like this one from beauty vlogger lauren giraldo
POD1000000005_S0000404	okay honestly not going to lie i was expecting things to look different in the 1st one i thought it was going to be like everything must go signs and stuff you know
POD1000000005_S0000405	i mean i feel like you can tell what i was expecting but a little bit of it seems like business as usual
POD1000000005_S0000406	so i am like hello are the headlines like do they mean it i do not know let us go in and see if we can get some bankrupt deals or not
POD1000000005_S0000407	let us just go see what the g is
POD1000000005_S0000408	fyi she did not actually buy anything at forever 21
POD1000000005_S0000409	but she did put together some looks and filmed herself wearing them in the dressing room so close enough
POD1000000005_S0000410	deals are great and all
POD1000000005_S0000411	but forever 21 is former global communications director kevin fagans said the bankruptcy news felt like a surprise gut punch even though he had already left the company
POD1000000005_S0000412	i really was not aware of the challenges
POD1000000005_S0000413	i mean i would hear obviously and you would kind of think that certain markets were not doing well and maybe we need to kind of push or help promote in those markets
POD1000000005_S0000414	i drive more pr see how we can increase foot traffic but never was i aware that things were really starting to come to a halt or at least bankruptcy was going to be in the foreseeable future
POD1000000005_S0000415	it is chapter 11 filing really leaned into the chang is immigrant story
POD1000000005_S0000416	under the subheading forever dreaming a roadmap to the american dream it read forever 21 is a story about family and the american dream
POD1000000005_S0000417	in an age when retail as most americans know it is under assault forever 21 intends to use these proceedings to remain viable and write a different ending from so many retail companies before it
POD1000000005_S0000418	the goal of these chapter 11 cases is clear emerge with a viable and feasible standalone business and keep the dream alive
POD1000000005_S0000419	as a part of its restructuring plan the company announced that it intended to streamline its retail operation pump up its e commerce game and shut down a whole lot of stores
POD1000000005_S0000420	nearly all of its international locations and more than 100 underperforming u s stores were on the chopping block
POD1000000005_S0000421	that is more than 40% of their physical retail locations
POD1000000005_S0000422	but those plans were all for naught
POD1000000005_S0000423	in february a group of buyers including some of forever 21 is biggest landlords put in an offer to buy the brand for the bargain basement price of $810
POD1000000005_S0000424	a judge approved the deal and boom
POD1000000005_S0000425	clothing retailer forever 21 has been sold after declaring bankruptcy late last year
POD1000000005_S0000426	sale includes all of forever 21 is assets including its remaining stores
POD1000000005_S0000427	just like that the dream died
POD1000000005_S0000428	after 35 years control of forever 21 slipped through the chang family is hands
POD1000000005_S0000429	while the changs are no longer billionaires it is impossible to say they did not reach some type of american dream
POD1000000005_S0000430	their aspirations of upward mobility clout and prestige were realized a 1000 times over
POD1000000005_S0000431	their children achieved ivy league educations and never wanted for anything

POD1000000011_S0000000	ha greetings class and welcome to counting school where what you learn really counts
POD1000000011_S0000001	so we want to start today with a little story about an old friend from sesame street
POD1000000011_S0000002	i am your teacher the count do you know why they call me the count
POD1000000011_S0000003	because we love to build things
POD1000000011_S0000004	i love the count and ken scarborough knows him really well because he is head writer at sesame street
POD1000000011_S0000005	his whole identity is wrapped up in being a count and being a guy who knows his numbers really well
POD1000000011_S0000006	now of course for the count that we all know and love numbers give him nothing but joy
POD1000000011_S0000007	99 sandwiches all together
POD1000000011_S0000009	but on this one day it is different
POD1000000011_S0000010	the count makes a mistake and he sort of cannot believe it he is crushed
POD1000000011_S0000012	what number did he forget
POD1000000011_S0000013	well somebody interrupted him it is really not his fault he was counting sandwiches he was really being helpful
POD1000000011_S0000014	9 sandwiches are you sure it count
POD1000000011_S0000015	0 but of course i am sure chris i am the count
POD1000000011_S0000016	ha
POD1000000011_S0000017	the cat
POD1000000011_S0000018	
POD1000000011_S0000020	elmo thinks the count made a little mistake
POD1000000011_S0000021	namaste
POD1000000011_S0000022	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000023	it really struck him to his core and he decided he was not going to be the count anymore
POD1000000011_S0000024	whoa so the count screws up he makes a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000025	yeah and he could not get over it
POD1000000011_S0000026	and you know what corey that means he is pretty similar to you and me
POD1000000011_S0000027	yeah because math anxiety is a real thing
POD1000000011_S0000029	estimates range up to 93% of american adults that is a lot cory
POD1000000011_S0000030	yeah i do not even need to know any math to know that that is a lot
POD1000000011_S0000031	yeah 93% of american adults feel some degree of anxiety that is specific to math
POD1000000011_S0000032	so if you avoid doing your budget or investing well we got a life kit for that
POD1000000011_S0000033	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000034	but also math anxiety could be part of the reason why
POD1000000011_S0000035	what should elmo and the cat do next the cat
POD1000000011_S0000037	nothing
POD1000000011_S0000038	huh
POD1000000011_S0000039	nada 0 zilch i shall never count again
POD1000000011_S0000040	what
POD1000000011_S0000041	and the count is not alone on tests math anxiety can cause students to perform as though they were a whole year behind in school
POD1000000011_S0000042	yeah obviously this is a real problem for schools and for how we teach math but what can we as parents do to shape our kids attitude towards math
POD1000000011_S0000043	we sat down with rosemary trulio
POD1000000011_S0000044	math is everywhere
POD1000000011_S0000045	she is the senior vice president of curriculum and content at sesame workshop and i put the problem to her this way
POD1000000011_S0000046	i feel like as a parent i understand pretty well how to promote early literacy
POD1000000011_S0000048	reading bedtime stories or singing the alphabet song
POD1000000011_S0000049	but when i think about the equivalent on the math side of things i just draw a blank
POD1000000011_S0000050	and i want you guys to help me fill in that blank what does it mean to promote the love of math early on
POD1000000011_S0000051	you are saying that we have to get them to love math they already love math
POD1000000011_S0000052	what
POD1000000011_S0000053	yes they are not coming into this world not liking math
POD1000000011_S0000055	so let us figure out if we can solve this little math equation here
POD1000000011_S0000056	you are listening to npr is life kit for parenting with sesame workshop i am anya kamenetz i am not afraid of a corny joke
POD1000000011_S0000057	i am corey turner and after the break we are going to give you some tips that you can use starting in the early years
POD1000000011_S0000058	but also strategies you can keep returning to even when you are grown up and no matter how old your kids are as well as what to never ever say to your kids about math
POD1000000011_S0000060	support for this npr podcast and the following message come from linkedin and the new linkedin learning which offers over 13000 online courses to help you achieve your goals

POD1000000011_S0000065	you are listening to life kit for parenting with sesame workshop in this episode we are going to do the equivalent of flipping to the back of the book to look right at the answers
POD1000000011_S0000066	yep
POD1000000011_S0000067	because we know that by listening to this math episode you had to overcome some anxieties i bet of your own
POD1000000011_S0000068	yeah so let us get right to our takeaways and number one do not let your math anxiety hold your kids back
POD1000000011_S0000069	math anxiety as we mentioned is a real phenomenon all over the world
POD1000000011_S0000070	yeah and it is pretty clearly related to how we teach math in school things like timed practice and memorization and high stakes testing and 0 my gosh i am getting hot flashes and sweaty palms just thinking about fact tests
POD1000000011_S0000071	ugh
POD1000000011_S0000072	and here is the really upsetting thing is that math anxiety it is not equal opportunity
POD1000000011_S0000073	that is right it is tied to stereotypes race and especially gender research shows that mothers and preschool teachers who are overwhelmingly women they can pass that feeling on to their kids especially to their girls
POD1000000011_S0000074	but there is some good news
POD1000000011_S0000075	children are not born with math anxiety it is passed on to them so i think that is why we have to check ourselves
POD1000000011_S0000076	in when we are talking about math
POD1000000011_S0000077	this was kind of a surprise for me because i thought that you know if my kid had a problem with math i could bond with him by saying hey you know it was tough for me too
POD1000000011_S0000078	but actually rosemary says .
POD1000000011_S0000079	saying i do not like math i can not do math that will get conveyed to your children
POD1000000011_S0000080	and the solution instead we need to reframe math
POD1000000011_S0000081	yeah rosemary says think about the fun activities that can back up and reinforce what they are learning in school
POD1000000011_S0000082	math is very much an integral part of your life do you love music
POD1000000011_S0000083	i do i love to sing
POD1000000011_S0000084	alright if you love music then you love math do you like to cook and bake
POD1000000011_S0000085	i love to cook and bake
POD1000000011_S0000086	okay then you love math because you can not do music and you can not cook and bake without math
POD1000000011_S0000087	so i can not cook or bake really and i definitely cannot sing but i love baseball for example and my boys and i we talk about baseball statistics all the time
POD1000000011_S0000088	so what is important rosemary says is recognizing math as part of many things that we like doing together
POD1000000011_S0000089	exactly and so to see more about how adults can weave math into our everyday moments of life even with really little kids you and i and our producer lauren mcgackie visited a really special preschool
POD1000000011_S0000091	they came to watch us play today
POD1000000011_S0000092	bye
POD1000000011_S0000093	this is the center for early childhood education it is our research preschool at eastern connecticut state university the lobby has this giant super realistic oak tree
POD1000000011_S0000094	yeah which i climbed inside very cool
POD1000000011_S0000095	nice to see you good morning
POD1000000011_S0000096	we should also say ania about a 3rd of the kids at this school speak spanish at home
POD1000000011_S0000097	that is right and at the preschool we sat down with one of the lead researchers sudhaswaminathan and she helped us understand a lot more about how to grow children who love math
POD1000000011_S0000098	the minute we say math we try to think of the big picture you know big old theorems big old geometry concepts
POD1000000011_S0000099	instead swaminathan says think small she is a professor in early childhood education at eastern connecticut state and her special focus is on early math learning
POD1000000011_S0000100	and suda and her colleagues have done lots of research to see what kinds of childhood experiences lead to better performance in math later on
POD1000000011_S0000101	and one of their answers makes up our 2nd takeaway takeaway number 2
POD1000000011_S0000102	talk about math take this really ordinary moment
POD1000000011_S0000103	you ask them to put their books away and say it does not fit in the shelf so why does not it fit
POD1000000011_S0000104	maybe it is the book is too tall too big
POD1000000011_S0000105	suda says you are actually talking about a math process it is problem solving
POD1000000011_S0000106	yeah and we heard lots of this by the way math talk at the preschool
POD1000000011_S0000108	does the duck fit in there too he did not fit when he was standing up
POD1000000011_S0000109	so you decided to lay him down does he fit now
POD1000000011_S0000110	but that is amy lopez the lead teacher for the toddler classroom
POD1000000011_S0000111	it is a sunny room with a cozy reading corner there is a play kitchen and blocks
POD1000000011_S0000112	and near the center of the room there is this table and amy is sitting with the children they are building together with magnetiles which are these colorful plastic blocks with different shapes that stick together
POD1000000011_S0000113	and they also have little plastic farm animals and one of the kids is kind of putting together a house
POD1000000011_S0000114	now you are using triangles and squares
POD1000000011_S0000116	naming the shapes in both english and in spanish when we played this tape for rosemary she said
POD1000000011_S0000117	what i heard there is the teacher using descriptive math language and that is so key for children to understand math concepts
POD1000000011_S0000118	you can not understand the concepts without the language
POD1000000011_S0000119	yeah and amy is not building the box for the kids she is actually making observations and kind of like narrating their thoughts in real time
POD1000000011_S0000120	the more blocks you add the longer it gets cohen i noticed that when you added more your line got longer and longer
POD1000000011_S0000121	when she said more blocks to make it longer i mean longer is a complex word for children
POD1000000011_S0000122	and they need to hear that language and they need to hear that language in a very concrete way
POD1000000011_S0000123	she was not even afraid to use really technical words like when this little boy was trying to make his little corral stand up
POD1000000011_S0000124	now you can put them all around the perimeter all around the edge
POD1000000011_S0000125	perimeter
POD1000000011_S0000126	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000127	another great occasion to talk math as rosemary said earlier is in music class
POD1000000011_S0000128	i am going to give everybody 2 rhythm sticks one for each hand we have smooth rhythm sticks
POD1000000011_S0000129	do you want to touch it
POD1000000011_S0000131	fear
POD1000000011_S0000132	dad
POD1000000011_S0000133	yep
POD1000000011_S0000135	you probably remember the kai and kory they are perfect for hitting your friends
POD1000000011_S0000136	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000137	do we tap them on our friends
POD1000000011_S0000138	no
POD1000000011_S0000139	do we bang them on the floor
POD1000000011_S0000140	bye
POD1000000011_S0000141	what could happen
POD1000000011_S0000142	and after this moment the children practice going faster
POD1000000011_S0000144	and then they go slow
POD1000000011_S0000145	mwah
POD1000000011_S0000147	faster and slower are relational concepts these are math words related to rhythm
POD1000000011_S0000148	so when we were talking to rosemary i had an epiphany on ya that my all time favorite sesame street moment
POD1000000011_S0000149	and i watched a lot of sesame as a kid
POD1000000011_S0000150	that is not obvious
POD1000000011_S0000152	it was a math moment and it is with my favorite character grover
POD1000000011_S0000153	
POD1000000011_S0000154	and so he is standing there in the foreground and he says
POD1000000011_S0000155	0 i .
POD1000000011_S0000156	and then he goes way back here
POD1000000011_S0000158	there
POD1000000011_S0000160	
POD1000000011_S0000162	far epiphany
POD1000000011_S0000164	so the point is parents get approximately 10 chances all day long every day every night to talk about math
POD1000000011_S0000165	that is of course a rough estimate but think about it
POD1000000011_S0000166	they are calendars and clocks money maps measuring crafts
POD1000000011_S0000167	it is very broad and i think that once parents understand the breadth of how we define math and how they are already doing it they go 0 that is math
POD1000000011_S0000168	i did not realize that was math 0 if that is math then i could do that
POD1000000011_S0000169	setting the table one to one correspondence that is math ordinal number 1st 2nd 3rd that is math
POD1000000011_S0000170	yeah and if you need even more chances roll the dice in our next takeaway takeaway number 3
POD1000000011_S0000171	play math
POD1000000011_S0000172	find ways to keep math in mind when you are playing with your kids suda says you may already be doing this
POD1000000011_S0000173	just play
POD1000000011_S0000174	and research has shown that when parents just play they are actually really really good at pulling out these deep concepts from children much better than even teachers
POD1000000011_S0000175	there is so many ways to play math with kids of all different ages
POD1000000011_S0000176	right there are puzzles of course and blocks like we heard with amy
POD1000000011_S0000177	there is video games and apps card games and especially board games
POD1000000011_S0000178	research has shown that the more kids play any game with dice and numbered squares the better their basic math skills get
POD1000000011_S0000179	you can even play math outside
POD1000000011_S0000180	i can give a big push to the swing or i can hop 3 times to go there
POD1000000011_S0000181	at suda is house hopscotch had -one
POD1000000011_S0000183	which was kind of mind blowing to me
POD1000000011_S0000184	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000185	and she says you know play can be the foundation even of advanced subjects like algebra
POD1000000011_S0000186	algebra is you know of all the math concepts algebra seems to shake many people is nerves
POD1000000011_S0000187	but what is algebra really if you think about it
POD1000000011_S0000188	it is recognizing that there are patterns in numbers there are patterns in equations and you know you are trying to balance the 2 sides of it
POD1000000011_S0000189	take this little moment in amy lopez is toddler room
POD1000000011_S0000190	when you put your triangles together it makes a square look
POD1000000011_S0000191	pim pim
POD1000000011_S0000192	same same they match
POD1000000011_S0000194	just like that one you made one that is the same great discovery
POD1000000011_S0000195	same same
POD1000000011_S0000196	exactly so as you know corey i have a 2 year old at home and i was getting so excited at this point
POD1000000011_S0000197	because i felt like hey i am ready to be the a plus ap extra credit mom
POD1000000011_S0000198	i am going to narrate every moment of block time i am going to use perimeter and quadrado
POD1000000011_S0000199	reign it in kaminets
POD1000000011_S0000200	ugh what
POD1000000011_S0000201	come on i am raring to go let us go to those flashcards come on
POD1000000011_S0000203	remember student warned us
POD1000000011_S0000204	and this really rings true for me
POD1000000011_S0000205	one thing i would tell parents not to do is to become the teacher in the house
POD1000000011_S0000206	ah alright
POD1000000011_S0000207	i get this
POD1000000011_S0000208	yeah i mean for one thing it is kind of annoying
POD1000000011_S0000209	you know when we play with our friends we are not constantly asking them let us count how many there is what is the shape we do not do that
POD1000000011_S0000210	she does not know what i do with my friends i might quiz my friends
POD1000000011_S0000212	i do not want to hang out with you
POD1000000011_S0000213	fine
POD1000000011_S0000214	alright the most important reason to not be so heavy handed when we are playing with our kids is take away number 4
POD1000000011_S0000215	math like life is so much more interesting and fun when we can get beyond right and wrong answers
POD1000000011_S0000216	for example suda said this
POD1000000011_S0000217	we are sitting at a round table and i could ask you anya what is the shape of this table
POD1000000011_S0000218	know it is a circle you know it
POD1000000011_S0000219	i mean so it is a but a better question would be to say anya why did you choose the circle for our table
POD1000000011_S0000220	that is better because she is actually interested in my answer she does not know what i am going to say
POD1000000011_S0000221	i do not know why you did that right but that gets us talking about shapes
POD1000000011_S0000222	it is a real conversation
POD1000000011_S0000223	yes and it is the kind of conversation that you could have with kids at almost any age
POD1000000011_S0000224	or another interesting question suda says might be how do you know the table is round
POD1000000011_S0000225	it is going to make them look at that circle one more time and to see that you know this it feels curvy and the other one feels sharp on the edge
POD1000000011_S0000226	so the key here is to keep things open ended
POD1000000011_S0000227	so we saw another great example of this in one of the other preschool classrooms there is a 4 year old boy named killy is kind of messing around with some blocks
POD1000000011_S0000228	and the teacher carla alamo was a master she just backed off and let him do his thing because you know what he is doing here
POD1000000011_S0000229	he is trying things out he is testing out hypotheses
POD1000000011_S0000230	this is data it is probability
POD1000000011_S0000231	it is not about getting to a certain place in the end
POD1000000011_S0000232	do you want the wheel to go under it or over it
POD1000000011_S0000233	over
POD1000000011_S0000234	over it
POD1000000011_S0000235	yeah and remember this is play it is open ended
POD1000000011_S0000236	there is no right or wrong she is letting him figure it out
POD1000000011_S0000237	do we need to change any blocks or add anything to make it jump higher
POD1000000011_S0000239	and rosemary says there is a social and emotional point we are making that goes deeper even than the math here
POD1000000011_S0000240	there should be no fear in making a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000241	let us say that again no fear in making a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000242	that is basically how children learn it is all trial and error for them
POD1000000011_S0000243	and they are also looking to us how we react to making a mistake and that is part of resiliency
POD1000000011_S0000244	and it is really helpful to communicate this attitude when our kids are a little older like mine are and they are learning math in school on somebody else is schedule
POD1000000011_S0000245	yeah i mean the pressure just gets higher from year to year and so the most helpful that we can be as parents is not to be frog marching them through their homework but try to make it feel okay to mess up sometimes and also to keep going
POD1000000011_S0000246	because it is all part of the process
POD1000000011_S0000247	yeah failure is important which is a lesson the count had to learn
POD1000000011_S0000248	0 i cannot believe it i the count made a counting mistake
POD1000000011_S0000249	just a little 10 the cat
POD1000000011_S0000250	so as we said in the beginning he messed up it was not his fault
POD1000000011_S0000251	he decides to quit being the cat
POD1000000011_S0000252	yeah and he goes in search of other implants
POD1000000011_S0000253	all right construction worker all right we are going to have to hammer 5 nails into this here beam
POD1000000011_S0000254	alright
POD1000000011_S0000255	but it turns out there is things you have got to count in doing construction and measuring and all this kind of stuff so there is no escaping it there
POD1000000011_S0000256	again this is ken scarborough the head writer at sesame
POD1000000011_S0000257	so he left that he became a rocket guy they would have to count down
POD1000000011_S0000258	100 9
POD1000000011_S0000260	and what finally gets the cow pack on track is actually another mistake
POD1000000011_S0000261	his friend elmo steps in and pretends to mess up his own counting just to help the count know that it is okay to mess up
POD1000000011_S0000262	56789
POD1000000011_S0000263	but i need 10 carrots
POD1000000011_S0000264	wait i believe you made a mistake elmo
POD1000000011_S0000265	0 a mistake
POD1000000011_S0000266	yes you said 4 twice you should count the carrots again
POD1000000011_S0000267	elmo can not do that to count elmo made a mistake so elmo is going to give up count
POD1000000011_S0000268	give up
POD1000000011_S0000269	give up
POD1000000011_S0000270	no no no elmo everybody makes mistakes
POD1000000011_S0000271	you cannot give up the important thing is to keep trying
POD1000000011_S0000272	suda actually told us this is a good tip for parents to try too you can make a mistake and give your kids a chance to correct you with math or you know anything else
POD1000000011_S0000273	i did give up but i should not have i must keep trying and you should too
POD1000000011_S0000274	yeah
POD1000000011_S0000275	so come let us count the carrots together
POD1000000011_S0000276	cool
POD1000000011_S0000278	one carrot
POD1000000011_S0000279	and just the way elmo did you can build up their confidence
POD1000000011_S0000280	9
POD1000000011_S0000281	10 carrots all together
POD1000000011_S0000283	so we started off this episode talking about a topic that i do not particularly love math but we ended up somewhere really great corey
POD1000000011_S0000284	because i feel like all of a sudden i realize that through exploring the world with my kid i can spark my curiosity i can look at stuff with new eyes
POD1000000011_S0000285	and i can go back and get a redo on something that was not so fun for me when i was a kid
POD1000000011_S0000286	yeah and i got to do my grover impression
POD1000000011_S0000288	great same same even steven

POD1000000011_S0000298	all right so takeaway number one do not let your math anxiety hold your kids back
POD1000000011_S0000299	yeah find math and everyday activities that you enjoy together
POD1000000011_S0000300	takeaway number 2 talk math
POD1000000011_S0000301	yeah triangle square perimeter near far up down longer shorter
POD1000000011_S0000302	faster slower
POD1000000011_S0000304	they are all talking math takeaway number 3
POD1000000011_S0000305	play math

POD1000000012_S0000055	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000056	how can we distract ourselves so we are not going to focus on these cookies right now
POD1000000012_S0000058	how about we start with some nice deep belly breathing
POD1000000012_S0000059	0 me know that one
POD1000000012_S0000061	that
POD1000000012_S0000062	okay so in through your nose

POD1000000012_S0000065	cookie you are breathing on the cookies
POD1000000012_S0000066	and me tummy grumbling you know me tummy has other ideas
POD1000000012_S0000067	we got to try a different strategy you know me not going to look at cookies
POD1000000012_S0000068	how about that
POD1000000012_S0000069	cookie that is a great idea and a great strategy we are going to turn our backs on these cookies so we are not going to see them
POD1000000012_S0000070	0 ok it is not easy because me still can smell cookies
POD1000000012_S0000071	0 boy

POD1000000012_S0000091	okay
POD1000000012_S0000092	is it is it safe to leave the cookies here are you going to be okay
POD1000000012_S0000094	i am not going to try my best cory

POD1000000012_S0000100	0 cookies look so yummy
POD1000000012_S0000102	okay well cookie monster waits in front of that big plate of cookies and we are going to make him wait a while
POD1000000012_S0000103	let us take a quick break and when we come back more on the science and the art of self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000105	support for this npr podcast and the following message come from linkedin and the new linkedin learning which offers over 13000 online courses to help you achieve your goals

POD1000000012_S0000109	we are back this is corey
POD1000000012_S0000110	and i am on ya
POD1000000012_S0000111	and we are going to finish our combo with cookie monster in just a few minutes
POD1000000012_S0000112	but 1st we should acknowledge it is pretty surprising that cookies become so skilled at self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000113	so i remember as a child watching cookie monster and just being like what is wrong with this maniac
POD1000000012_S0000115	that is kentaro fujita an expert on self regulation who we will talk to in a bit
POD1000000012_S0000116	and yeah i have to agree on ya the cookie we grew up with
POD1000000012_S0000117	cowabunga
POD1000000012_S0000119	was pure
POD1000000012_S0000121	fuzzy
POD1000000012_S0000123	okay
POD1000000012_S0000125	but rosemary from sesame says cookie is transformation was actually really really intentional
POD1000000012_S0000126	sesame street every year we focus on a critical educational need in children is lives
POD1000000012_S0000127	and it was about 78 years ago when all of this research started to come out showing the importance of these self regulation skills and how they were related to school achievement school readiness and life lessons
POD1000000012_S0000129	and that is exactly why we are going to be talking about this today
POD1000000012_S0000130	yeah and sesame decided once they knew all of this that cookie monster was the perfect muppet to send this message
POD1000000012_S0000131	let us not define him as this impulsive character who has no self control because he can have self control
POD1000000012_S0000132	so after
POD1000000012_S0000134	3 years
POD1000000012_S0000135	cookie evolves
POD1000000012_S0000136	yes
POD1000000012_S0000137	and he becomes someone who was
POD1000000012_S0000138	is much more reflective who can actually stop and pause and control his emotion and his desire for eating the cookie right away
POD1000000012_S0000139	that is inspiring rosemarie
POD1000000012_S0000140	yes it is
POD1000000012_S0000142	it is inspiring for me as a 42 year old that i have one more year to get all my self control together
POD1000000012_S0000143	i believe in you
POD1000000012_S0000144	well thank you very much sesame is hope here was .
POD1000000012_S0000145	that we could model these strategies for children to learn and apply these strategies and build their own self regulation toolbox
POD1000000012_S0000146	and several years ago sesame back to study to see if this could really work
POD1000000012_S0000147	and so some of the kids in the study watched videos of cookie monster practicing his strategies kind of like you heard at the top of the podcast
POD1000000012_S0000148	me got new strategy
POD1000000012_S0000150	then rosemary says the researcher tempted all the kids with their favorite snack
POD1000000012_S0000151	chocolate chippies
POD1000000012_S0000153	and the kids who watched cookie monster
POD1000000012_S0000154	on average waited 4 additional minutes
POD1000000012_S0000155	that is huge for a preschooler
POD1000000012_S0000156	dude
POD1000000012_S0000158	so let us break this down for a minute
POD1000000012_S0000159	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000160	what does not eating cookies have to do with being successful in school or in your life
POD1000000012_S0000161	rosemary explained that self regulation is not just about treats self regulation is a set of skills that helps us reach our goals
POD1000000012_S0000162	specifically we need to either monitor or change or redirect our thoughts feelings and behavior towards a particular goal that we have chosen
POD1000000012_S0000163	yeah and within self regulation you are going to hear us talk a lot in this episode specifically about self control which is either resisting an impulse or overcoming a temptation on the way to a goal
POD1000000012_S0000164	so self control means more than resisting a cookie
POD1000000012_S0000165	it means not hitting a classmate on the playground when he takes your tricycle
POD1000000012_S0000166	it means working through your math homework and not throwing a tantrum when you get stumped
POD1000000012_S0000167	yeah it can even mean working through a big fear that you have when it overwhelms you
POD1000000012_S0000168	and all of this is a big deal right now not only because of the new research that rosemary referenced but also because there is just more and more kids out there with diagnosed issues that can interfere with the development of self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000169	things like childhood trauma adhd or being on the autism spectrum
POD1000000012_S0000170	but also many parents especially privileged parents are basically stepping into their kids lives to smooth over their kids paths and remove any sources of frustration really before their kids have a chance to learn how to deal with it
POD1000000012_S0000171	i do not know what you are talking about cory
POD1000000012_S0000172	i appreciate your honesty
POD1000000012_S0000173	i mean i can see that this is very well meaning and a lot of parents just want the best for their kids in a really competitive world
POD1000000012_S0000174	but what we are doing also deprives them of the natural opportunities that they might have to learn self regulation along the way
POD1000000012_S0000175	and that is what is going on in children is lives right now that they are becoming risk averse
POD1000000012_S0000176	they want everything done for them
POD1000000012_S0000177	and so sesame decided to send the message that you know if cookie monster can learn to control himself anybody can
POD1000000012_S0000178	but i was kind of skeptical corey i wanted to learn more about the science of this right
POD1000000012_S0000179	because obviously i see that my kids as they grow up they get better at self regulation my 2 year old is not as good at waiting as my 7 year old
POD1000000012_S0000180	that is right
POD1000000012_S0000181	so you know it is just really something i need to coach my kids on is like do i just send them to self control summer camp
POD1000000012_S0000183	yes and no
POD1000000012_S0000184	some of the variation is genetic and you are right that children is brains do naturally develop along these lines
POD1000000012_S0000185	but ken fujita who we heard from earlier who said cookie monster was a maniac .
POD1000000012_S0000186	yet
POD1000000012_S0000187	he happens to be a professor of psychology at the ohio state university and he describes it this way
POD1000000012_S0000188	so the brain you can think of as being like the hardware
POD1000000012_S0000189	but even when we have the hardware we still need to learn how to use the hardware with the right software
POD1000000012_S0000190	so by software ken is talking about the skills and the strategies that parents can help kids practice to improve their self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000191	exactly
POD1000000012_S0000192	and there is a lot of research supporting very specific interventions so without making everybody wait any longer let us open up the toolbox and get right to our takeaways
POD1000000012_S0000194	alright and takeaway number one is big picture advice for us parents
POD1000000012_S0000196	we need to start thinking of self regulation as a skill to be practiced
POD1000000012_S0000197	exactly
POD1000000012_S0000198	so this part made me think about when my husband was teaching our older daughter lulu to ski right
POD1000000012_S0000199	so 1st she was kind of freaked out the mountain is big
POD1000000012_S0000200	she is small it is cold
POD1000000012_S0000201	and he had to begin by really acknowledging all of the big feelings that she was having and rosemary says we should do the same thing when we are working on a skill
POD1000000012_S0000202	you need to validate children is emotions i know it is hard
POD1000000012_S0000203	i know it is hard the worst thing to be is like you know 0 it is easy do not worry and so no
POD1000000012_S0000204	so you have done that empathizing and then you have to move on to the nuts and bolts
POD1000000012_S0000205	what is it that you actually do you know you do not just tell the kid ski down the hill and you do not just tell a kid control yourself
POD1000000012_S0000206	yeah do not do not throw a tantrum
POD1000000012_S0000207	right
POD1000000012_S0000208	that does not work you can not do it that way
POD1000000012_S0000209	so when you are skiing you break down the skill into tiny pieces and there are strategies that you can use for each one
POD1000000012_S0000210	for example when you want to slow down you point the skis towards each other and the code word for that is pizza
POD1000000012_S0000211	like it is a slice of pizza the 2 skis coming together
POD1000000012_S0000212	thank you life kit skiing
POD1000000012_S0000213	yes now the analogy here is we are taking self regulation or self control these big big concepts and we are breaking them down into very specific strategies that we want our kids to try
POD1000000012_S0000214	right and the other key thing to remember is that our kids are going to fail and probably fail a lot
POD1000000012_S0000215	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000216	before they succeed and we really have to not only accept that failure but praise their effort every chance we get
POD1000000012_S0000217	so even if it is i just waited a minute praise the effort i waited a minute
POD1000000012_S0000218	yeah and next time maybe they will wait 2 minutes
POD1000000012_S0000219	totally and here is the thing i mean obviously not every kid needs to learn to ski but every kid needs to learn to regulate their emotions
POD1000000012_S0000220	and they can as long as they have a coach
POD1000000012_S0000221	yeah so let us look at self control again what is the 1st step to not hitting your friend or not throwing your homework across the room
POD1000000012_S0000222	tying your hands behind your back
POD1000000012_S0000224	a better way is not getting so mad in the 1st place
POD1000000012_S0000225	and that is why we need to start here when it comes to teaching our kids to regulate their emotions because it is self regulation right
POD1000000012_S0000226	so takeaway number 2 yelling calm down at your kids when they get really worked up that does not work
POD1000000012_S0000227	yeah i know this because i have tried it
POD1000000012_S0000229	i have tried it too many times
POD1000000012_S0000230	i mean it is just really common to respond to our kids frustration with our own frustration
POD1000000012_S0000231	but there is something that can help both of us as long as we are consistent both our kids and ourselves and that is our slow deep breathing
POD1000000012_S0000232	belly breathing comes in so taking those deep slow breaths in and out
POD1000000012_S0000234	just like i did with cookie monster i know it was silly and probably sounded a little ridiculous
POD1000000012_S0000235	but it works i do it at home i do it at work
POD1000000012_S0000236	you can ask all of the lifekit producers it works
POD1000000012_S0000237	and it is important to make it a habit
POD1000000012_S0000238	and you know what that is not all cory
POD1000000012_S0000239	you can teach your kid to hug a pillow or a stuffed animal to calm down you can also try this craft
POD1000000012_S0000240	okay take a jar fill it with glue water and glitter
POD1000000012_S0000241	and then make sure you screw the lid on really tight that is important
POD1000000012_S0000243	and whenever they are feeling stressed out you can tell your kids to give that jar a shake
POD1000000012_S0000244	i know i am overwhelmed right now but let me just breathe and focus on how that glitter is swirling around which represents my feelings right now
POD1000000012_S0000245	but if i belly breathe and watch the glitter settle it gives me the time to calm down
POD1000000012_S0000247	alright so belly breathing glitter jars our next takeaway zeroes in very specifically on self control
POD1000000012_S0000248	that is right takeaway number 3 pretend the cookie is plastic
POD1000000012_S0000250	alright so you have probably heard of the marshmallow test
POD1000000012_S0000251	it was a famous study that was done where children were offered a marshmallow to eat
POD1000000012_S0000252	and they were told they could eat it right away but if they waited they could have 2 of the treats later
POD1000000012_S0000253	yeah so this study is so famous if you just go to youtube and type in marshmallow test you will find all kinds of videos of kids being subjected to this sort of torment
POD1000000012_S0000254	i am going to go do something and then i will come back
POD1000000012_S0000255	it smells yummy
POD1000000012_S0000257	it smells really good
POD1000000012_S0000258	the experiment has been repeated many many times since it was 1st done by walter mischel in the late 1960s
POD1000000012_S0000259	and there has been some controversy over what it exactly proved especially with some of the long term outcomes and when you take factors like social class into consideration
POD1000000012_S0000260	yes absolutely but at the same time that basic experimental design with kids and treats and a timer
POD1000000012_S0000261	it is a really good context to see the strategies that children can and do use when their self control is being tested
POD1000000012_S0000262	what seems to lead kids to be tempted by the smaller immediate reward the one marshmallow is the fact that they are thinking about it in a hot way
POD1000000012_S0000263	and by hot ken fujita means intense or urgent something that you want to act on right now but he says
POD1000000012_S0000264	if kids could find different ways to cool their thoughts they were much more likely to wait out the delay
POD1000000012_S0000265	and that knowing these strategies seemed to predict which kids were able to delay and which ones were not
POD1000000012_S0000266	for example kids pretended the marshmallows were just puffy clouds or that they were looking at the marshmallows through a picture frame
POD1000000012_S0000267	what i really like about this query is that kids are using a strength their imaginations to overcome their weakness in self control or delaying gratification
POD1000000012_S0000268	and rosemary told us that practicing these strategies and learning about them can be really empowering and actually therapeutic especially for kids who struggle with self regulation
POD1000000012_S0000269	yeah and all the experts told us it is really important that that practice not only happen in moments of crisis but you really lay the groundwork for it so that when those hot feelings arise they turn to the strategy and use it
POD1000000012_S0000270	so you plant it and then it pays off
POD1000000012_S0000271	and then it pays off later exactly
POD1000000012_S0000273	now take away number 4 speaking of imagination this is my favorite take away
POD1000000012_S0000275	i am so excited about this one what would batman do
POD1000000012_S0000276	yeah ken vegeta told us about a fascinating study
POD1000000012_S0000277	it is a variation on the marshmallow test where researchers asked kids to do a very boring task while they were simultaneously tempted to play a fun video game at the same time
POD1000000012_S0000278	but then .
POD1000000012_S0000279	they asked kids to identify their favorite superhero
POD1000000012_S0000280	and this is so neat we talked about this in a previous episode right
POD1000000012_S0000281	but the characters like superheroes or princesses they are so powerful for kids whose self images are really just starting to form
POD1000000012_S0000282	so if kids said batman for example they would get a batman mask and a batman cape
POD1000000012_S0000283	i am batman ing
POD1000000012_S0000285	and then the kids were told while they were waiting out the delay they should ask themselves the question what would batman do
POD1000000012_S0000286	and what they found was really startling
POD1000000012_S0000287	so the kids who were channeling their heroes were much more able to resist the temptation
POD1000000012_S0000288	i love this and i am totally going to use this although you know it is a problem because like for me it would not be the normal bap it would be like
POD1000000012_S0000290	corey look over there it is a bright sh
POD1000000012_S0000292	what
POD1000000012_S0000294	0 i see what you did there nice nice kamenetz
POD1000000012_S0000296	takeaway number 5 be smart about distractions
POD1000000012_S0000297	getting out of a hot moment sometimes can take distraction just like when you ask cookie monster about his taste in russian literature
POD1000000012_S0000298	right or like when you are in the car with your kids and suddenly they transition from are we there yet to mom he is hitting me dad he is hitting me
POD1000000012_S0000299	that is the perfect time to resort to a distraction like travel bingo or the license plate game
POD1000000012_S0000300	i am going to take my attention off of this treat and place my attention on something else so i am going to go play with something else
POD1000000012_S0000301	right and every parent knows like rosemary says you need to have a long list of potential distractions up your sleeve right
POD1000000012_S0000302	it could be reading it could be singing
POD1000000012_S0000303	it could be dabbing
POD1000000012_S0000304	it could be drawing
POD1000000012_S0000305	or flossing
POD1000000012_S0000306	you mean like dental care
POD1000000012_S0000307	no no i mean like
POD1000000012_S0000309	you mean like fortnite care yeah gotcha
POD1000000012_S0000310	or i do not know youtube being a 10 different videos of lego batman rapping when you are supposed to be writing a podcast script
POD1000000012_S0000311	that is a good distraction
POD1000000012_S0000312	we have no idea about that and speaking of distractions
POD1000000012_S0000314	flip side here
POD1000000012_S0000316	removing distractions can also be an opportunity for you to set your kids up for success when it comes to self care
POD1000000012_S0000318	frankly your co host
POD1000000012_S0000320	for your co host
POD1000000012_S0000321	so the idea here is remove opportunities for frustration right so maybe when they are working on their homework you keep the video games out of sight
POD1000000012_S0000322	or maybe you do not keep the cookie jar on the counter instead you go out for ice cream once a week
POD1000000012_S0000323	yeah and you want your kids to build self control
POD1000000012_S0000324	but you need to do it in a really age appropriate way you do not want to exhaust them by testing their self control constantly
POD1000000012_S0000325	and you also do not want to set unrealistic goals that you know they are never going to get to
POD1000000012_S0000326	and there is so many different ways to approach this our takeaway number 6 is the world is already full of opportunities to build self regulation skills
POD1000000012_S0000327	so we have been talking about explicit strategies mostly for self control but researchers are also backing up something that parents and educators have known for a long time
POD1000000012_S0000328	yeah there are so many everyday experiences that can build this broader set of executive function and self regulation skills
POD1000000012_S0000329	ken fujita says for him one area was music
POD1000000012_S0000330	i attended music schools i played violin and piano
POD1000000012_S0000332	did he love to practice no
POD1000000012_S0000333	nobody wants to practice practicing is very tedious
POD1000000012_S0000334	nobody likes to receive negative feedback right
POD1000000012_S0000335	but responding constructively to negative feedback to enduring the drudgery of everyday practicing these all require self control
POD1000000012_S0000336	another activity that experiments have shown to improve self regulation is martial arts
POD1000000012_S0000337	i am also a martial arts instructor i practice the japanese martial art kendo sword fighting
POD1000000012_S0000338	and i have been amazed at watching children transform in front of my eyes some of them come in very undisciplined
POD1000000012_S0000339	but you know a couple of years of really hard intense training and practice and commitment they learn the value of delaying gratification
POD1000000012_S0000340	anya i just have to say for the record forget what would batman do from now on i am asking myself what would ken fujita do
POD1000000012_S0000341	totally
POD1000000012_S0000342	and let us also add to the list of martial arts learning a foreign language practicing yoga
POD1000000012_S0000343	yep
POD1000000012_S0000344	definitely proven strategies for building self regulation skills
POD1000000012_S0000346	okay you guys cookie has been waiting all this time
POD1000000012_S0000348	yeah remember the top of the episode corey laughed allegedly to get milk
POD1000000012_S0000349	we have been sitting in a different studio recording this whole podcast
POD1000000012_S0000350	i left him hanging he is practicing his strategies
POD1000000012_S0000351	i hope he is
POD1000000012_S0000354	strategy
POD1000000012_S0000355	i hope so too so i guess it is time for me to go in there and say hi
POD1000000012_S0000356	0 and i still need to get the milk
POD1000000012_S0000357	alright i will see you there in a minute
POD1000000012_S0000358	alright
POD1000000012_S0000360	0 hi hi anya
POD1000000012_S0000361	hi
POD1000000012_S0000363	hi rosemary
POD1000000012_S0000364	0 are those cookies

POD1000000012_S0000367	00 boy you know anya me no can believe me saying this but we need to wait to eat cookies
POD1000000012_S0000368	cookie this is so hard for you but you are doing such a great job
POD1000000012_S0000369	yeah yeah all this waiting getting really hard for monster
POD1000000012_S0000371	kory
POD1000000012_S0000372	00 you back
POD1000000012_S0000374	yeah please hurry
POD1000000012_S0000375	okay 0 and you waited to eat the cookies thank you
POD1000000012_S0000376	and i am so proud of you cookie monster
POD1000000012_S0000377	0 thank you i really appreciate that
POD1000000012_S0000378	but me also appreciate cookie
POD1000000012_S0000381	that was some serious nomming
POD1000000012_S0000383	i love the way you yelled cookie like some maniacal fiend
POD1000000012_S0000384	that is just what you say when you have a cookie
POD1000000012_S0000386	anyway i miss those cookies already
POD1000000012_S0000387	well i miss cookie monster i felt like i could tell him anything
POD1000000012_S0000389	let us recap
POD1000000012_S0000390	let us do it takeaway number one
POD1000000012_S0000391	it is for us parents start looking at self regulation as a skill to be practiced
POD1000000012_S0000392	yeah learning social and emotional skills is like learning to play baseball or to ski
POD1000000012_S0000393	only much more important
POD1000000012_S0000394	we need to be supportive as parents and we need to validate our kids big feelings
POD1000000012_S0000395	also break up the skills into pieces give them strategies to get better and praise their efforts along the way
POD1000000012_S0000396	takeaway number 2 yelling calm down does not work
POD1000000012_S0000397	no we tried that it does not work
POD1000000012_S0000398	yeah
POD1000000012_S0000399	so instead
POD1000000012_S0000400	try belly breathing
POD1000000012_S0000401	a glitter jar

POD1000000013_S0000003	and the northern ireland local government commissioner for standards many things and soon to leave to become the police ombudsman for northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000004	marie you are extremely welcome
POD1000000013_S0000005	you are greatly admired and respected throughout the ombudsman world and we are lucky to have you
POD1000000013_S0000006	we like to start each episode of radio ombudsman by hearing a bit about our guests in terms of their background
POD1000000013_S0000007	where were you born for example and brought up
POD1000000013_S0000008	what kind of values do you remember being imbibed with early on
POD1000000013_S0000009	well thank you rob and thank you for the kind introduction
POD1000000013_S0000010	and it is great to be on this innovative program radio ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000011	where was i born i was born in belfast northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000012	i was born into a large family i was the youngest of a family of 6
POD1000000013_S0000013	west belfast in the 1960s when i was born was a place of much turmoil
POD1000000013_S0000014	and my early
POD1000000013_S0000016	early childhood adult life and into my time at university was very much a time of conflict in northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000017	i came from a very religious background where values were very important
POD1000000013_S0000018	so there was a willingness and a desire on the part of my mum and dad to bring us up regardless to respect everybody and to respect everyone is views and religion
POD1000000013_S0000020	that is interesting and that really anticipates the follow up question which is what do you learn and take from those awful situations
POD1000000013_S0000021	the need for fairness is very important part of communities getting on together
POD1000000013_S0000022	if one community feels they have been dealt with unfairly or indeed one individual or group of individuals that that is potentially destabilizing for society and for that community
POD1000000013_S0000023	so i realized very early on something that i think is probably part of my nature which is this desire for fairness
POD1000000013_S0000025	does that explain why you took a law degree
POD1000000013_S0000026	in part one of the things that i have spoken about openly is the fact that i was in a convent school
POD1000000013_S0000027	and i was there was a particular day i was called out at assembly
POD1000000013_S0000028	i was 12 13 and i was hugely humiliated and embarrassed by the fact that i was being accused of stealing another girl is gym shoes when i had not
POD1000000013_S0000029	it was a mistake and that mistake came out but i remember that feeling
POD1000000013_S0000030	i think that was the more cathartic moment if you like the feeling of it is not i was on my own
POD1000000013_S0000031	and i was dealt with unfairly and i wanted to be a lawyer because i was going to help people that were treated unfairly
POD1000000013_S0000032	so that is what made me want to be a lawyer really
POD1000000013_S0000033	yeah okay
POD1000000013_S0000034	and after university i know you became a solicitor but was that straight away
POD1000000013_S0000035	yes yes i did not i know nowadays there is a gap here
POD1000000013_S0000036	but yes i went to the institute of legal studies and practiced as a solicitor in private practice and then in the public sector
POD1000000013_S0000037	mostly litigation but started to focus on human rights and data protection freedom of information when i was in the public sector
POD1000000013_S0000038	so when did you join the information commissioner is office
POD1000000013_S0000039	2003
POD1000000013_S0000040	okay and what did you do before then
POD1000000013_S0000041	before then i worked for the housing authority
POD1000000013_S0000042	i worked for 17 years in the legal department of the housing authority dealing with intractable problems such as anti social behavior homelessness fractured communities who had to be housed near to each other
POD1000000013_S0000043	yeah
POD1000000013_S0000044	so issues such as peace walls
POD1000000013_S0000045	so it was a good grounding if you like for dealing with the issues that i deal with now but also in terms of the information
POD1000000013_S0000046	i recognize the need for freedom of information and for people is information to be protected
POD1000000013_S0000047	and i really i loved my time in the information commissioner is office i was there 5 years
POD1000000013_S0000048	and you spent some of it in manchester with
POD1000000013_S0000050	that was a treat
POD1000000013_S0000051	yes
POD1000000013_S0000052	privilege
POD1000000013_S0000053	yes
POD1000000013_S0000054	it was a time of emerging from the office was changing from being the data protection commissioner a kind of a registration function
POD1000000013_S0000055	and it had taken on freedom of information which was so exciting
POD1000000013_S0000056	and it was about the office getting geared up for freedom of information and indeed having regional offices
POD1000000013_S0000057	and the one in northern ireland i actually helped establish that office
POD1000000013_S0000058	and when did you become an ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000059	in 2009 so after leaving the ico i went back to private practice
POD1000000013_S0000060	i worked in a commercial law firm and then realized that really was not for me that i was much more my main interest was social justice
POD1000000013_S0000061	so i saw the role of deputy ombudsman and i thought that is interesting i think i will put my hat in the ring for that
POD1000000013_S0000062	and yeah i was lucky i got the job
POD1000000013_S0000063	and you were lucky enough to work for the legendary tom frawley
POD1000000013_S0000064	doctor frohley yeah he has been a huge support to me throughout my career and a mentor
POD1000000013_S0000065	and yes legendary
POD1000000013_S0000066	we were talking earlier today about leadership and his famous phrase on leadership is i am their leader which way did they go
POD1000000013_S0000068	so it is kind of you know to be a leader you need to have followers
POD1000000013_S0000069	absolutely
POD1000000013_S0000070	okay so for our english listeners and for those in the united states northern ireland is obviously unique politically and socially
POD1000000013_S0000071	but i do not think that many of us have a great deal of understanding of how this must have impacted on your work as an ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000072	could you say a little bit about that
POD1000000013_S0000073	well i think because the 1st ombudsman is office in northern ireland was created in 1969 so we are celebrating our 50th anniversary year this year
POD1000000013_S0000074	it was created to deal with complaints of discrimination in housing employment particularly in local government
POD1000000013_S0000075	i think that the genesis of the idea for an ombudsman was to bring fairness to the citizen
POD1000000013_S0000076	and i think that is really been always a key element of the work of the office
POD1000000013_S0000077	i mean we feel very very strongly that we are in the justice business that it is about being fair
POD1000000013_S0000078	and not only being fair to complainants or people who feel that public services have failed them but being fair to those who are wrongly criticized or wrongly blamed
POD1000000013_S0000079	because i think the role of an ombudsman is also to provide vindication when things have gone right
POD1000000013_S0000080	what about the impact of sectarianism on your work both inside the office and externally as ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000081	well i have a workforce who believe totally my staff totally believe in fairness and equality
POD1000000013_S0000082	and it does not matter who complains to the office it does not matter who complains or what the nature of the complaint is that we are going to deal with it
POD1000000013_S0000083	but i suppose where the area which is most challenging is in my role as local government standards commissioner where i myself have been accused of sectarianism
POD1000000013_S0000084	because i was adjudicating on a particular councilor from a particular part of the unionist community
POD1000000013_S0000085	so there is that added layer of not only wanting to do things right to make the right decision but being aware that no matter what that decision is it might please one side or the other
POD1000000013_S0000086	so to be accused of sectarianism was a huge hurt for me because that is not part of my values or my staff values
POD1000000013_S0000087	i mean that is a big issue because it affects you personally
POD1000000013_S0000088	how do you deal with that because you are a very resilient tough person but even that must be hard to deal with
POD1000000013_S0000089	well 1st of all i have got huge support from my deputy in the senior management team who reassured me that of course this is not true and you know it is not true and we know it is not true
POD1000000013_S0000090	but i think what was difficult was the impact on my family and how they felt
POD1000000013_S0000091	my husband was angry and my children were unhappy about it
POD1000000013_S0000092	how did it affect me i learned that you can deal with this sort of criticism
POD1000000013_S0000093	and i learned that behind it all you have got to be sure that you are making the right decision
POD1000000013_S0000094	i can remember a few weeks ago when i was savagely criticized on twitter
POD1000000013_S0000095	and i was thirsting to reply and my older son said to me leave it alone dad they want you to reply
POD1000000013_S0000096	and i think that was quite wise advice
POD1000000013_S0000097	so you do need to consult with people on personal issues do not you
POD1000000013_S0000098	i think you do need to consult
POD1000000013_S0000099	what has been helpful has been part of the ombudsman community is response to this is the personal support you have given me rob i was able to talk to you about it
POD1000000013_S0000100	i was able to talk to others like the current police ombudsman for northern ireland who said leave it alone
POD1000000013_S0000101	just leave it because if you do anything if you take any legal action then it is merely going to provide more oxygen
POD1000000013_S0000102	yeah
POD1000000013_S0000103	does not stop it being difficult
POD1000000013_S0000104	no
POD1000000013_S0000105	personally difficult and that is where the resilience comes in
POD1000000013_S0000106	that is where you have got to get up the next morning go into work and your staff have got to see that a low might affect you inside
POD1000000013_S0000107	that you are going to continue to lead the office and do the job
POD1000000013_S0000108	thank you that is important
POD1000000013_S0000109	let us just move that on a little bit and talk about human rights issues in relation to the actions of public services
POD1000000013_S0000110	you launched a brilliant human rights manual which sets out an approach that many ombudsmen in europe take
POD1000000013_S0000111	but is not particularly prevalent in the united kingdom about actions that can be taken by an ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000112	could you tell us a bit more about how you created this
POD1000000013_S0000113	well it was created jointly with the northern ireland human rights commission and it started as ever as all good ideas with a conversation
POD1000000013_S0000114	and it was a conversation between the human rights commission and our office around the sort of casework that we were dealing with
POD1000000013_S0000115	we were dealing with issues like the roma community feeling discriminated because they did not have access to health services
POD1000000013_S0000116	we are dealing with issues of consent patients not giving consent to interventions and the family and the patient feeling excluded from the decision making
POD1000000013_S0000117	but also we realized that ombudsman and human rights commissions and or equality bodies are actually doing the same job
POD1000000013_S0000118	so my style is to move on from the conversation and actually have a product
POD1000000013_S0000119	and the product was how to do this manual for ombudsman staff
POD1000000013_S0000120	how to introduce human rights principles into ombudsman investigations
POD1000000013_S0000121	and it is quite simple and it is not about strasbourg jurisprudence
POD1000000013_S0000122	that is the beauty of it i think for non lawyers for non legal staff that they are very simple principles
POD1000000013_S0000123	participation a person affected by a decision by whatever public service provider be it health be it housing be it local government that they have to be able to participate
POD1000000013_S0000124	they have to be given enough information to participate effectively in the decision making
POD1000000013_S0000125	so there is the principle of empowerment giving information
POD1000000013_S0000126	there is the principle of non discrimination and being treated equally and fairly and having equal access
POD1000000013_S0000127	and ultimately the 4th principle of the human rights based approach is accountability and that is what we ombudsmen do
POD1000000013_S0000128	we hold public services to account
POD1000000013_S0000129	and would you say that you have been able to hold public services more to account as a result of having that human rights based approach
POD1000000013_S0000130	yes i think maladministration is a tool
POD1000000013_S0000131	but i think that having a human rights lens allows you to look more closely at a way so much from the process as to how the process actually affects the individuals and affects the individuals rights
POD1000000013_S0000132	so to give you an example we had a case where a young man died as a result of a routine ear operation
POD1000000013_S0000133	and it was a one in a 10 reaction to a titanium implant to the packing around a titanium implant
POD1000000013_S0000134	the point being his mum and dad believed that he was not consented for that intervention
POD1000000013_S0000135	and that that was unfair and affected his human rights
POD1000000013_S0000136	the coroner had refused to undertake an inquest saying it did not affect his human rights
POD1000000013_S0000137	when it came to my office we identified the human rights principle of participation
POD1000000013_S0000138	if i know what is going to happen to me if i am told of the risks instead of someone else making the decision for me then my human rights have been respected
POD1000000013_S0000139	when i drew that out in the investigation report i was able to come to a conclusion that there was a conflict between the experts
POD1000000013_S0000140	some said well another consultant might not have done the implant another said they would have gone ahead with the implant
POD1000000013_S0000141	but actually the human rights based approach meant that i thought about the individual and that they had not been properly consented
POD1000000013_S0000142	the result not only did the family get an investigation report identifying this issue but they were able to go to the coroner
POD1000000013_S0000143	he is commenced an inquest
POD1000000013_S0000144	now you have 2 things in northern ireland that we do not have you have .
POD1000000013_S0000145	partly because of your own excellence in bringing it about you have an integrated public service ombudsman scheme and you have the power of own initiative
POD1000000013_S0000146	are these valuable additions to the way ombudsmen should be working
POD1000000013_S0000147	i do believe in the one stop shop model
POD1000000013_S0000148	the public services ombudsman in northern ireland looks at complaints about government departments statutory agencies local government health and social care education schools universities colleges
POD1000000013_S0000149	i think that can be challenging for staff but i believe that they enjoy the variety
POD1000000013_S0000150	but i also believe that an ombudsman ombudsman principles of good administration apply across sectors
POD1000000013_S0000151	so yes i think it is of value
POD1000000013_S0000152	i think having one place to go to to seek redress for injustice is important
POD1000000013_S0000153	if people do not want to go to court there is an ombudsman there that can look at the full range
POD1000000013_S0000154	own initiative is for me an essential tool of every ombudsman is toolkit
POD1000000013_S0000155	when you look internationally
POD1000000013_S0000156	you look at ombudsman in australia you look at ombudsman in europe you look at ombudsman in north america the ontario ombudsman the rest western australian ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000157	they all have own initiative they have all had own initiative from the start
POD1000000013_S0000158	the irish ombudsman act that was created in 1980 had its own initiative there as well as dealing with individual complaints
POD1000000013_S0000159	for me an ombudsman without own initiative can not fulfill the mandate of improving public services for many not just for the individual
POD1000000013_S0000160	so you would have no hesitation about introducing an initiative it is essential
POD1000000013_S0000161	not at all i was lucky to be part of the development of the public service ombudsman act
POD1000000013_S0000162	and had an opportunity to persuade officials who were perhaps nervous about the ombudsman having own initiative powers
POD1000000013_S0000163	that really this was something that actually could benefit public services in the end
POD1000000013_S0000164	see it is about prevention
POD1000000013_S0000165	you can deal with numerous complaints but never get to the core issue whereas own initiative allows you to tackle the core issue of systemic failing
POD1000000013_S0000166	well i agree with that
POD1000000013_S0000167	and that is why i think it is necessary for us to have the reform that you have already been operating for nearly 3 years now
POD1000000013_S0000168	yes and now the welsh ombudsman is about to get that also
POD1000000013_S0000169	i believe scottish ombudsman would like to own initiative
POD1000000013_S0000170	so if that happens it means that the devolved administrations have it
POD1000000013_S0000171	and the 1st ever ombudsman in these islands the parliamentary ombudsman has not
POD1000000013_S0000172	and i think that is missing an opportunity to improve public services for the citizen
POD1000000013_S0000173	as you move on from the public service ombudsman what are you most proud of
POD1000000013_S0000174	is it bringing the whole thing together the integration of the various systems
POD1000000013_S0000175	well i think the legislation that allowed the public services ombudsman as a one stop shop for complaints about public services
POD1000000013_S0000176	but also being able to bring in local government standards
POD1000000013_S0000177	because northern ireland which was the only part in europe did not have a mandatory code of conduct for local representatives
POD1000000013_S0000178	that was introduced in 2014
POD1000000013_S0000179	and my office and i as deputy ombudsman now ombudsman have been key to establishing an investigative and judicative function in northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000180	that is a unique model but i believe operates very well
POD1000000013_S0000181	that is not work that is outwith ombudsmanry
POD1000000013_S0000182	because for me ethical standards values fairness they are all part of good governance and that is where we ombudsmen are
POD1000000013_S0000183	i mean we are not a court we do not declare do not make binding decisions
POD1000000013_S0000184	but nevertheless we can influence with the recommendations that we make and with setting standards
POD1000000013_S0000186	now we asked colleagues on twitter to send in questions
POD1000000013_S0000187	and we had a set of questions from one dissatisfied user of the service under your predecessor who felt that she had not been treated fairly by the system
POD1000000013_S0000188	what can you say to people in that position
POD1000000013_S0000189	i think that many people misunderstand the role of the ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000190	they believe that the ombudsman is there particularly to advocate for them and their particular issue
POD1000000013_S0000191	ombudsmen are impartial so a finding of no failure can be disappointing to a complainant
POD1000000013_S0000192	and i believe that was the case in relation to the particular individual that you refer to
POD1000000013_S0000193	of the previous ombudsman did not find in her favor and that can be disappointing
POD1000000013_S0000194	but then you have got to understand that there are the other side of that is that perhaps a clinician or a member of health staff who has been criticized receives a message that actually they did it right
POD1000000013_S0000195	but there are many occasions in which complainants do not agree with my decisions
POD1000000013_S0000197	but i still have to decide fairly ensure there is a fair process ensure everyone gets an opportunity to comment and report on the matter
POD1000000013_S0000198	that is what an ombudsman does
POD1000000013_S0000199	yes it is difficult sometimes to explain that while the complaint belongs to the complainant the decision belongs to the ombudsman providing it is evidence based and rigorous
POD1000000013_S0000200	provided it is evidence based and rigorous but also i believe fair
POD1000000013_S0000201	i think you have to give everyone an opportunity including those who are criticized
POD1000000013_S0000202	but this issue about it is an ombudsman decision while you bring your complaint
POD1000000013_S0000203	it is the ombudsman is decision has actually been written into the legislation that i refer to
POD1000000013_S0000204	which is that under the northern irish ombudsman legislation the 2016 act that i mentioned that even if a complainant withdrew their complaint i can still investigate
POD1000000013_S0000205	so it is the ombudsman is investigation
POD1000000013_S0000206	now you have been with the office in northern ireland for 10 years
POD1000000013_S0000207	it is a long time will you have any regrets about .
POD1000000013_S0000208	moving on even though it is to an even more difficult and challenging role
POD1000000013_S0000209	i have huge regrets about leaving my staff because they are wonderful to work with hugely supportive
POD1000000013_S0000210	and on days when i do not have my usual level of energy they give me the energy back to keep going
POD1000000013_S0000211	so i have regrets about leaving my staff
POD1000000013_S0000212	but i was asked this question about why do you want to undertake the role of police ombudsman
POD1000000013_S0000213	i do believe that it is about public service and it is about bringing my experience
POD1000000013_S0000214	you said 10 years experience in the ombudsman is office 5 years experience in the information commissioner is office
POD1000000013_S0000215	it is bringing that to bear in what is a very challenging area dealing with police complaints in northern ireland
POD1000000013_S0000216	now you have spent the day with us speaking to my colleagues at our all staff away day
POD1000000013_S0000217	what advice would you give to our younger colleagues many of whom have only recently joined the ombuds profession
POD1000000013_S0000218	the advice i would give is 1st of all it is a profession
POD1000000013_S0000219	as you know rob from your discussions with me i believe very much that it has to be recognized as a profession
POD1000000013_S0000220	and that i am amazed at your accreditation project at getting that off the ground
POD1000000013_S0000221	i would advise the young people in this office to take advantage of that
POD1000000013_S0000222	that is a wonderful opportunity and i realize the rigor and the commitment to achieving that accreditation but i would say go for it
POD1000000013_S0000223	i mean that in this you are leading the way in the ombudsman world
POD1000000013_S0000224	it is something that many have talked about i have talked about it myself
POD1000000013_S0000225	i have tried to do it but you and amanda have actually done it and i think that is amazing
POD1000000013_S0000226	so my advice is take the opportunity
POD1000000013_S0000227	marie anderson thank you very much indeed
POD1000000013_S0000228	it has been an absolute privilege and a pleasure talking to you
POD1000000013_S0000230	thank you rob thank you
POD1000000013_S0000232	thank you for listening to radio ombudsman we would love to know what you think so please leave a review or comment
POD1000000013_S0000233	if you like what you hear please share and subscribe to future episodes
POD1000000015_S0000001	hello this is rob barrons here welcoming you to another episode of radio ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000002	i am delighted to say that my guest today is rosemary agnew scottish public services ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000003	rosemary took up the post of ombudsman around the same time as i did in 2017 and before this she was the scottish information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000004	she has a wealth of experience in public service which we will come on to
POD1000000015_S0000005	she has developed the idea of a complaint standards authority in scotland which is something that i want to ask her about
POD1000000015_S0000006	rosemary you are very welcome thank you for coming
POD1000000015_S0000007	now we like to start each episode by hearing a bit about our guests and where they come from
POD1000000015_S0000008	so can you tell us a bit about your early life and the values you got from that
POD1000000015_S0000009	i am hugely lucky i come from a very loving family
POD1000000015_S0000010	i have 4 younger brothers so i think it fair to say that issues about equality were probably in there before i even knew the word
POD1000000015_S0000011	but my family are military families so i traveled around as a child
POD1000000015_S0000012	and mostly i would say what i got from them was a real strong moral compass
POD1000000015_S0000013	not drilled into me must do this must not do that but about treating people with respect particularly when we were traveling to new places and meeting new people for the 1st time
POD1000000015_S0000014	and i think that that moral and ethical background not called that then
POD1000000015_S0000015	it was just try and be a good person tell the truth do your homework on time all these sorts of things probably instilled in me a strong work ethic
POD1000000015_S0000016	but it also instilled in me a very deep level of caring for people
POD1000000015_S0000017	
POD1000000015_S0000018	because i was able to see over the whole of my life still a whole range of people who have different starts in life different opportunities
POD1000000015_S0000019	and i think within that i have developed my own sense of justice
POD1000000015_S0000020	and i am hugely grateful to my parents they are lovely people
POD1000000015_S0000021	and i even get on with my brothers occasionally
POD1000000015_S0000023	when you were traveling around as part of the military family was that difficult did you feel like an outsider
POD1000000015_S0000024	yes and no to outsider
POD1000000015_S0000025	i went to a lot of schools so you had to learn to make friends quickly and you could not have a long lead in time if you like
POD1000000015_S0000026	because i lived a lot of time in military accommodation that was like a big family of itself because you tended to be with people who were in a similar situation
POD1000000015_S0000027	but mostly i suppose i just saw it as a big sense of adventure
POD1000000015_S0000028	it does not suit all but for me it was great because i just moved around had a whole wealth of experience which i do not think i would have got in any other way
POD1000000015_S0000029	what did you study at university
POD1000000015_S0000030	well my main claim to fame i think sitting here in manchester is the thing that i am probably most pleased with is my mba from manchester business school
POD1000000015_S0000031	i also have a teaching qualification
POD1000000015_S0000032	but i think the mba because i went back to that after i had been working a while was probably the most enlightening part of my education
POD1000000015_S0000033	because again i learned a lot about a lot of things but what it gave me because i was able to reflect on a working background as well
POD1000000015_S0000034	what it gave me was a sense of how to ask questions and challenge in a way perhaps i had not done before that
POD1000000015_S0000035	they are very famous alumni from that mba i think vincent campany is a graduate of that scheme did you know him
POD1000000015_S0000036	no i did not in fact i do not think that any of my cohort are names that have come up to prominence
POD1000000015_S0000037	but have all gone on to do good things some very interesting things
POD1000000015_S0000038	i for myself because i was public sector at the time and i have remained public sector for most of the time since then perhaps have a slightly different view of it
POD1000000015_S0000039	because i was very deliberate in not always going down public sector routes for study or public sector modules because i wanted to learn more about different sorts of thinking
POD1000000015_S0000040	when did you decide what sort of career you wanted
POD1000000015_S0000041	i am yet to meet an ombudsman who decided they wanted to be an ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000042	yep
POD1000000015_S0000043	i think
POD1000000015_S0000044	i can own up to that
POD1000000015_S0000045	it is fair to say that
POD1000000015_S0000046	i went to work i was working in china lecturing in business and economics and i needed a job when i got back
POD1000000015_S0000047	so i thought 0 they are advertising for investigators at the local government ombudsman that will do for a while it will pay the mortgage until i get something else
POD1000000015_S0000048	and i have pretty much never left ombudsmaning or information commissioning since
POD1000000015_S0000049	and i think what it was was i found a job that i enjoyed it was challenging but actually fitted in with my value system
POD1000000015_S0000050	right and you have had a very distinguished and varied career you were the scottish information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000051	now what was the highlight of that before you came to the scottish public service ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000052	i think it is hard to say what highlight is in terms of being the information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000053	there are a number of things that i did that i was really proud of in a good way
POD1000000015_S0000054	one of them was it sounds very trivial but we established a portal for the uploading of freedom of information statistics from public bodies in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000055	and what that means is now there is a 3 or 4 year database of the number of freedom of information requests and the outcome of them for the whole of scotland
POD1000000015_S0000056	that we can look at trends we can look at developments
POD1000000015_S0000057	and that actually for me was a highlight because i did not necessarily have the enforcement power to do it
POD1000000015_S0000058	it was done through cooperation and co working with public bodies
POD1000000015_S0000059	the other couple of things that really stick in my mind was very very early on a particular decision i made
POD1000000015_S0000060	which was telling the scottish government they had to disclose whether they had taken legal advice about scotland is position with europe
POD1000000015_S0000061	should they gain independence because it was the time of the independence referendum
POD1000000015_S0000062	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000063	and why that is particularly interesting is it was a very big issue i think in the independence referendum and nobody i think could have foreseen where we are now
POD1000000015_S0000064	the final one which i think i will talk about more when we talk maybe about some of the ombudsman powers
POD1000000015_S0000065	was about a different way of intervening in relation to good and poor practice with scottish public bodies
POD1000000015_S0000066	you are english i think is that correct
POD1000000015_S0000067	yes
POD1000000015_S0000068	so has there ever been an issue about you holding prestigious and important jobs in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000069	about an english person having that responsibility
POD1000000015_S0000070	no i have a scottish name agnew is a scottish name and i am married to somebody from scottish descent
POD1000000015_S0000071	i was once asked by a journalist was i happy that i had adopted scotland as my home
POD1000000015_S0000072	and i think it is fair to say the answer reflected how i felt which was i am eternally grateful that scotland has adopted me as somebody who lives there and does these things within scotland
POD1000000015_S0000073	but no it is a different experience to being in england but i have never not to my face anyway ever had an issue with being english
POD1000000015_S0000074	that is good to hear
POD1000000015_S0000075	now can we just talk a bit about the scottish ombudsman which you took up post nearly 3 years ago
POD1000000015_S0000076	the devolved ombudsmen are different from the uk ombudsmen
POD1000000015_S0000077	because they are more modern they have adopted legislation to make them more relevant to developing situations and you have more powers than the uk ombudsman has
POD1000000015_S0000078	what is it like being the head of an integrated public service ombudsman is that a good thing
POD1000000015_S0000079	yes i think it is a very good thing because you have a different sort of insight you have a different sort of overview and sectors do vary
POD1000000015_S0000080	there is variance because they are working to different regulations it makes your job very varied also
POD1000000015_S0000081	i think one of the challenges with it though is if you work in a specific sector
POD1000000015_S0000082	so if i reflect on local government ombudsman you became much more immersed in the technicalities of local government
POD1000000015_S0000083	when you work across sectors what we find is particularly a personal reflection is i have to do a bit more digging round to find out about how the sectors operate in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000084	and i also rely quite a lot on professional advice particularly for health and social work
POD1000000015_S0000085	so we do not necessarily develop through experience of volume of cases the same experience that you do when you are perhaps looking at
POD1000000015_S0000086	one particular area of public service
POD1000000015_S0000087	but the other thing that i think reflects with myself and the welsh and the northern ireland ombudsman is because the population of the country is smaller
POD1000000015_S0000088	and the country itself has a different sort of structure to it
POD1000000015_S0000089	you often get given things to do that are not necessarily what you would expect an ombudsman to be doing
POD1000000015_S0000090	so as well as complaint handling and the complaint standards we also have duties for with the final stage of appeal for a benefit scottish welfare fund
POD1000000015_S0000091	and then when you look at northern ireland and wales they also have other things that are different
POD1000000015_S0000092	and i think that is as much a challenge as anything because it is almost like running 2 completely different functions but trying to have an integrated organization
POD1000000015_S0000093	okay so you rely on professional advice but there must also be a challenge for your case handlers to deal with the width of functions that they come up with
POD1000000015_S0000094	are you divided according to the sectors or do people have
POD1000000015_S0000096	multitasking to do
POD1000000015_S0000097	they have multitasking to do and they are an incredible set of people my investigators
POD1000000015_S0000098	but i think one of the things that drives us and that is probably the uniting thing is very much about values
POD1000000015_S0000099	and i think like most ombudsman organizations i have ever come across it is a fairly unique workforce i would say
POD1000000015_S0000100	because you ask anybody why we are there and very rarely will you deviate far from because we want to make a difference because we want to see improvement because we want to make things better
POD1000000015_S0000101	so yes it is a challenge having the scope and we have some individuals who may have a background in a particular area but we do not have specialists
POD1000000015_S0000102	ok now what you have which we do not have is the status of being a complaint standards authority
POD1000000015_S0000103	could you explain to our listeners briefly what that means
POD1000000015_S0000104	briefly what it means is the ombudsman is responsible for setting a model complaints handling process that all scottish bodies must follow
POD1000000015_S0000105	and we then with that have a duty to monitor performance in relation to complaint handling and combined with some of our other powers duty to enforce good practice to report on it
POD1000000015_S0000106	now that sounds you know 0 that is nice model complaints handling
POD1000000015_S0000107	but what it means in practice is with some slight variations by sector because different sectors have slightly different needs
POD1000000015_S0000108	it means that anybody making a complaint to a public body in scotland and about a public body in scotland is basically making a complaint under the same set of standards
POD1000000015_S0000109	so the model complaints handling process says that the 1st stage of a complaint you must try and respond within 5 working days to resolve it
POD1000000015_S0000110	very big focus on resolution
POD1000000015_S0000111	if you can not or the person is not satisfied you can then take another 20 working days to look at it in more detail
POD1000000015_S0000112	if it is something that you think you need more than 20 days for then talk to the complainer about that
POD1000000015_S0000113	but it essentially means that if somebody does not receive a response or does not receive a response in time they get to the ombudsman a lot quicker than they might otherwise do
POD1000000015_S0000114	the other benefit of the model complaints handling process is that there is a very strong focus on learning from complaints
POD1000000015_S0000115	so the standards that go with this which incidentally i have to lay before the scottish parliament the standards
POD1000000015_S0000116	they also have a very strong bent on learning from complaints
POD1000000015_S0000117	and i think that is an area where we can perhaps develop more in how we hold public bodies to account to demonstrate that learning
POD1000000015_S0000118	because like our complaints the model complaints handling we have to show that there is an impact and that there is value to individuals and to public services as a whole
POD1000000015_S0000119	i think for me the most valuable thing about it though is it gives you an opportunity to work with public bodies not always in opposition to them
POD1000000015_S0000120	which with the best will in the world however much you try a resolution or a sort of discursive way of looking at complaints
POD1000000015_S0000121	once a complaint has reached the ombudsman it is in many ways adversarial whether you want it to be or not
POD1000000015_S0000122	but when you are talking about complaint handling as a whole you have an opportunity actually to help public bodies
POD1000000015_S0000123	and encourage them to get better at complaint handling which you hope means they get better at learning from complaints
POD1000000015_S0000124	which means people get the right service the 1st time
POD1000000015_S0000125	i do not think we will ever eliminate complaints but certainly it hopefully will make it a more productive experience
POD1000000015_S0000126	now i am a full supporter of what you are doing
POD1000000015_S0000127	i am a burglar of your practice when i was the higher education ombudsman i stole it hook line and sinker to use in english universities
POD1000000015_S0000128	the idea that they could resolve complaints within 5 days was anathema to them they would not have that we ended up with 90
POD1000000015_S0000129	but nevertheless they did it
POD1000000015_S0000130	but the difference and the radical nature of what you do is effectively you are a regulator now
POD1000000015_S0000131	whereas ombudsmen have traditionally always said we rely on our moral authority not on a coercive power
POD1000000015_S0000132	has that made a difference or is it just words
POD1000000015_S0000133	no i do not think it makes it is made a difference yet
POD1000000015_S0000134	i also think i should add that i was not ombudsman when the complaint standard authority came in
POD1000000015_S0000135	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000136	and credit has to go to jim martin my predecessor for driving this
POD1000000015_S0000137	yep
POD1000000015_S0000138	what he is left me as a legacy is something really good to develop and work with which is what we are doing now
POD1000000015_S0000139	having been an information commissioner which really is a regulatory function your decision is binding or you go to court
POD1000000015_S0000140	i think the concept of regulation probably has not crept into our thinking with complaint standards in quite the same way
POD1000000015_S0000141	but it is something that we are currently developing but maybe not calling it regulation in the same way
POD1000000015_S0000142	because one of the things that i would say learning from hindsight is that we took a very structured approach of rolling it out sector by sector this model complaints handling
POD1000000015_S0000143	and what that meant was it was a number of years before every public body in scotland was following this
POD1000000015_S0000144	so the nhs was the last and that has been the last i think just coming up to the end of their 2nd year
POD1000000015_S0000145	if you compare that to the 1st which was local government
POD1000000015_S0000146	local government now a really high percentage of complaints get responded to in the 1st instance in the 5 working days
POD1000000015_S0000147	i think from memory it is over 80% and that is really significant for complainers
POD1000000015_S0000148	now what we have been looking at in the last few months and we went live with in april is what we have called our support and intervention policy
POD1000000015_S0000149	and this is a concept that i brought with me from being information commissioner
POD1000000015_S0000150	and basically was looking at all the powers that you have as an ombudsman because the real value comes in the combination of them not just the individual bits
POD1000000015_S0000151	so when you look at the powers to set complaint handling processes to take action if complaint handling falls short you then look at other things like your information gathering powers
POD1000000015_S0000152	we have created a framework which sets out what our powers are and within that what we are going to do to either support or if necessary intervene
POD1000000015_S0000153	because when we for example a simple example we might see a number of complaints from a public body where the final response that they give to the complainer does not signpost the ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000154	they have a duty to do that under the complaints handling process
POD1000000015_S0000155	so we are getting better at our own intelligence we are logging feedback recommendations observations from what we see in complaints
POD1000000015_S0000156	so if we spot something like that we might just well my investigators my complaints reviewers will let the public body know
POD1000000015_S0000157	we give feedback in decisions
POD1000000015_S0000158	if we keep seeing that we might give it more formal and say we spotted this a number of times
POD1000000015_S0000159	but is there any help we might offer to say share a template letter
POD1000000015_S0000160	or if it is something different perhaps go and give them some training if we have got the resource to do that
POD1000000015_S0000161	but we set it out step by step at which point it becomes a management issue and senior managers might actually contact senior managers or chief executives
POD1000000015_S0000162	the ultimate being we use the powers that the ombudsman has to enforce and report
POD1000000015_S0000164	very incremental and civilized but do you come across intransigence
POD1000000015_S0000165	well it went live in april and so far we have not found intransigence
POD1000000015_S0000166	and i think some of this is drawing on experience of
POD1000000015_S0000167	information commissioner that i will give you a very simple example
POD1000000015_S0000168	similar powers to compel production of information for an investigation
POD1000000015_S0000169	and telling public bodies very formally if you do not provide this this and this by this date i will report on this i will take further action
POD1000000015_S0000170	it can actually be treated as contempt of court in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000171	so you only need to make that clear that you are going to do it and to do it once and then report on it in your annual report
POD1000000015_S0000172	and actually public bodies realize i think that you are being serious
POD1000000015_S0000173	but we try to get to the point before that where you point out this is the value particularly for the complainer of doing this
POD1000000015_S0000174	so we are in early days we have not come across the real intransigence yet
POD1000000015_S0000175	but i have no doubt that there will be some there at some point
POD1000000015_S0000176	but the word civilized is a good one and we will endeavor to be as civilized as we can but firm with it
POD1000000015_S0000177	what is your report to the scottish parliament
POD1000000015_S0000178	yes
POD1000000015_S0000179	what is your relationship like with that body
POD1000000015_S0000180	i would say it is pretty good in the sense of it is open challenging and when i say friendly i do not mean we are all friends it is very professional in many ways
POD1000000015_S0000181	so my main dealings are with the scottish parliamentary corporate body
POD1000000015_S0000182	i get my funding through them so we have contact with them on a fairly regular basis
POD1000000015_S0000183	each year i appear before the local government and communities committee to be held accountable for my annual reports
POD1000000015_S0000184	so they will ask me questions about our performance about what we are doing
POD1000000015_S0000185	i do appear before other committees as well either in relation to other policies or in relation to other consultations that we have responded to
POD1000000015_S0000186	i would say in scotland that generally the ombudsman is held in high regard and seen as being independent and impartial
POD1000000015_S0000187	and probably the most telling evidence of this is we are taking on new powers next year
POD1000000015_S0000188	this is about whistle blowing
POD1000000015_S0000189	yes i am taking on the wonderful title of independent national whistleblowing officer for the nhs in scotland
POD1000000015_S0000190	wow
POD1000000015_S0000191	and the reason that we are taking on this function is because the government is public consultation it was suggested it should be the ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000192	it is another good example of how in a smaller jurisdiction you get a number of different things
POD1000000015_S0000193	but going back to parliament they have held me to account on things but also where i have brought something to them in my committee appearances they have also been quite supportive
POD1000000015_S0000194	so one of my beefs about my legislation is complaints must be in writing unless there are special circumstances
POD1000000015_S0000195	now the problem with that is the onus is on the complainer to show special circumstances
POD1000000015_S0000196	and it means you can not be as flexible in how you take complaints
POD1000000015_S0000197	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000198	and i have been trying since i became ombudsman to have the legislation it is secondary legislation to say i can take complaints in any format
POD1000000015_S0000199	and at the last parliamentary appearance the committee did actually write to the government and say we think this is a good idea please could you look into this again for us
POD1000000015_S0000200	sadly the scottish government are not taking it forward at this time because they have other business and do not have the resource apparently which is very disappointing
POD1000000015_S0000201	we are coming towards the end but let me ask you a few quickfire questions
POD1000000015_S0000202	so you are funded differently to the way we are funded because we get our money from a broad treasury vote
POD1000000015_S0000203	but you are funded through parliament
POD1000000015_S0000204	have you got enough money is that a satisfactory way to do things
POD1000000015_S0000205	no i have not got enough money
POD1000000015_S0000206	and it is satisfactory in the sense of i think it is good that the funding does not come from government
POD1000000015_S0000207	it adds something to your being able to say i am independent what i think is unsatisfactory about it is and probably the same for you is the annuality of it
POD1000000015_S0000208	it is very difficult to do proper business and resource planning when you can not guarantee you will have the money to do it next year
POD1000000015_S0000209	it also means that i feel i do go through some fairly unnecessary hoops just to get one additional member of staff or an extra little bit of money for this
POD1000000015_S0000210	where it does work well and where i think the corporate body really try hard for myself and other parliamentary crown appointments
POD1000000015_S0000211	is they hold a contingency fund to which we can apply
POD1000000015_S0000212	for unexpected things so if we were judicially reviewed we could get legal costs through that
POD1000000015_S0000213	and that works well to the point we had some unexpected it costs this year which we were able to go to the contingency fund
POD1000000015_S0000214	but generally i think ombudsmen across the uk are underfunded
POD1000000015_S0000215	if we had sufficient funding we would not have backlogs of cases we would be doing things quicker
POD1000000015_S0000216	but we have to make do with where we are at the moment
POD1000000015_S0000217	2 final questions rosemary 1st of all going forward what is your biggest challenge as the ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000218	are you an ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000219	i am happy to be an ombudsman because that is what the legislation says and i know the origins of the word
POD1000000015_S0000220	but equally i do not mind if other people call me something similar whatever they are comfortable with
POD1000000015_S0000221	it is the spirit of what we do that is really important
POD1000000015_S0000222	i think my biggest challenge and the biggest challenge for my office is a combination of resourcing and the whistleblowing work that is coming next year
POD1000000015_S0000223	that is fundamentally different in some ways
POD1000000015_S0000224	will you have regulatory powers
POD1000000015_S0000225	my powers will be very similar as they are to ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000226	right
POD1000000015_S0000228	this is big
POD1000000015_S0000229	yeah
POD1000000015_S0000230	and it is very different from what happens in england
POD1000000015_S0000231	it is almost 2 similar but completely distinct functions
POD1000000015_S0000232	2 different titles that go with them ombudsman and independent
POD1000000015_S0000234	as a result of that
POD1000000015_S0000235	i do not know
POD1000000015_S0000237	i say i would like one i would do the job anyway
POD1000000015_S0000238	but i suppose for me the issue of the pay is not so much for my tenure but for future ombudsman
POD1000000015_S0000239	because i have a real concern across in common with fellow ombudsmen in the uk that
POD1000000015_S0000240	if you do not pay your ombudsman enough to attract good ombudsman you can not forever rely on what i think has happened so far
POD1000000015_S0000241	just in scotland we have just got good people who have been attracted to the work
POD1000000015_S0000242	here
POD1000000015_S0000243	so i hope they up the pay but if it is not for me i do not mind
POD1000000015_S0000244	what does the legislation say about 2nd terms for onboards
POD1000000015_S0000245	in scotland there are no 2nd terms
POD1000000015_S0000246	so you after 5 years you have to move on do you
POD1000000015_S0000247	i
POD1000000015_S0000249	so under public sector law it can be 4 to 8 years
POD1000000015_S0000250	so as information commissioner i actually had a 6 year tenure this one is 8 years
POD1000000015_S0000251	but at the point that i became ombudsman it was already known that we would be taking on the whistleblowing so it is probably right for that
POD1000000015_S0000252	because just the nearly 3 years getting to the point of knowing what the legislation is going to say has been over in a blink of an eye
POD1000000015_S0000253	okay last question we are in manchester this is a young thriving organization full of young graduates who have just come into the ombudsman world
POD1000000015_S0000254	perhaps 120 young graduates in the last 18 months
POD1000000015_S0000255	you are an experienced highly respected member of the profession if i can call it that
POD1000000015_S0000256	what would be your advice to my colleagues just coming into the ombuds field
POD1000000015_S0000257	do not ever lose sight of the passion of what drives you to do the right thing for the right reasons
POD1000000015_S0000258	but leave ombudsmaning for a while and go and do something else and come back to it
POD1000000015_S0000259	so that you can see just how wonderful a values based organization is but also so you have a different perspective on world experiences
POD1000000015_S0000260	that is lovely rosemary it has been a great privilege for us to listen to you
POD1000000015_S0000261	thank you very much indeed
POD1000000015_S0000262	it has been a pleasure to be here rob
POD1000000015_S0000264	thank you for listening to radio ombudsman we would love to know what you think so please leave a review or comment
POD1000000015_S0000265	if you like what you hear please share and subscribe to future episodes
POD1000000016_S0000001	it is quiet out here the seagulls
POD1000000016_S0000003	the sun is warm but it is not too humid it is actually kind of a great day for fishing
POD1000000016_S0000005	why it sticks
POD1000000016_S0000007	what does it smell like
POD1000000016_S0000008	smells like dead fish
POD1000000016_S0000010	smells like the water
POD1000000016_S0000012	what is going through your head right now
POD1000000016_S0000014	i do not know thinking about what they went through
POD1000000016_S0000016	i do not know i just wonder a lot what it was what it was like
POD1000000016_S0000018	they say our people were born on the water
POD1000000016_S0000020	when it occurred no one can say for certain perhaps it was in the 2nd week or the 3rd but surely by the 4th
POD1000000016_S0000021	when they had not seen their land or any land for so many days that they lost count
POD1000000016_S0000023	it was after the fear had turned to despair and the despair to resignation and the resignation gave way finally to resolve
POD1000000016_S0000025	they knew then that they would not hug their grandmothers again or share a laugh with a cousin during his nuptials or sing their baby softly to sleep with the same lullabies that their mothers had once sung to them
POD1000000016_S0000027	the tail eternity of the atlantic ocean had severed them so completely that it was as if nothing had ever existed before
POD1000000016_S0000029	that everything they ever knew had simply vanished from the earth
POD1000000016_S0000031	some could not bear the realization
POD1000000016_S0000033	they heave themselves over the walls of wooden ships to swim one last time with the ancestors
POD1000000016_S0000035	others refused to eat mouths clamped shut until their hearts gave out
POD1000000016_S0000037	but in the suffocating hull of a ship called the white lion bound for where they did not know
POD1000000016_S0000038	those who refused to die understood that the men and women chained next to them in the dark were no longer strangers
POD1000000016_S0000040	they had been forged in trauma
POD1000000016_S0000042	they have been made black by those who believe themselves to be white
POD1000000016_S0000044	and where they were headed black equals slave
POD1000000016_S0000046	so these were their people now
POD1000000016_S0000048	what happened here .
POD1000000016_S0000050	i mean we really do not know a lot
POD1000000016_S0000052	a pirate ship by the name of white lion sails into the bay here
POD1000000016_S0000053	and they needed to trade something of value so that they could get supplies to make the rest of their journey and what they traded were 20 to 30 africans
POD1000000016_S0000054	and this would be at this place kind of ironically called point comfort where slavery in the british north american colonies that would go on to become the united states begins
POD1000000016_S0000056	from the new york times magazine i am nicole hannah jones this is 1619
POD1000000016_S0000059	that is your happy valentine is day nicole this is a tape for nicole
POD1000000016_S0000060	hello darling how you doing excuse me while i partake of this kansas steak
POD1000000016_S0000061	that is okay
POD1000000016_S0000062	when i was a child my dad always flew a flag in our front yard our house is on a corner lot and in the front yard right in the corner was this
POD1000000016_S0000063	i could not tell you how tall it was it always seemed really garishly tall to me at the time there was this very tall aluminum flagpole my parents did not make a lot of money so our house always had paint chipping
POD1000000016_S0000064	and there was always something about the house that was in disarray you know the grass was looking disheveled or the railing on the stairs was falling off but the flag was always pristine
POD1000000016_S0000065	as soon as it started to show even the slightest tatter my dad would replace the flag with a fresh new flag
POD1000000016_S0000066	he would never allow a tatter flag to fly and i did not understand it i did not know other black kids whose parents were flying a flag in their front yard
POD1000000016_S0000067	i knew lots of white people who flew flags lots of white people who flew flags
POD1000000016_S0000069	my dad was born on a sharecropping farm in greenwood mississippi where his family picked cotton in the same cotton fields that enslaved people had picked cotton not too long before
POD1000000016_S0000070	that county leflore county in mississippi lynched more black people than any other county in mississippi and mississippi lynched more black people than any other state in the country
POD1000000016_S0000071	so it was a pretty devastatingly violent and hard place to live
POD1000000016_S0000073	my dad is mom fled the south like 10s of other black people during the great migration and came north to waterloo and found many of the same barriers that she had sought to escape
POD1000000016_S0000074	she was forced to buy a house on the black side of town most jobs were unavailable to her so she cleaned white people is houses my father went to segregated schools
POD1000000016_S0000075	and at a young age my father joined the military so that he could get his way out of poverty but also for the reasons that so many black people joined the military
POD1000000016_S0000076	which is he hoped that if he served his country his country might finally see him as an american
POD1000000016_S0000077	he loved being in the army he was stationed in germany picked up german very quickly he was so smart
POD1000000016_S0000078	he loved talking about that time it was a period where he got to see things that poor black child born in mississippi would not normally get to see
POD1000000016_S0000079	but the military did not end up being a way out for my dad for long he was passed up for opportunities
POD1000000016_S0000080	and the only jobs my dad ever worked were service jobs he worked as a convenience store clerk or a bus driver and because of that
POD1000000016_S0000081	this big pristine american flag flying in the front of our yard was deeply embarrassing to me
POD1000000016_S0000082	and i did not understand why he would feel that much love for a country that clearly did not love him
POD1000000016_S0000084	i felt this way all through high school i was no longer standing for the national anthem i had stopped saying the pledge of allegiance and really
POD1000000016_S0000085	throughout most of my adult life i mean clearly i know i am an american
POD1000000016_S0000086	i was born here every family member for generations back that i know were all born here but i never felt like i could claim fully that i was an american
POD1000000016_S0000088	but it was not until i really started researching and reading and thinking about this project that my own thinking started to shift
POD1000000016_S0000089	that i realized my dad understood things that i never knew
POD1000000016_S0000090	i now understand for the 1st time why my dad was so proud to fly that flag
POD1000000016_S0000093	my name is fountain hughes i was born in charlottesville virginia
POD1000000016_S0000094	my grandfather belonged to thomas jefferson my grandfather was 115 years old when he died and now i am 101 years old
POD1000000016_S0000095	now in my boy days we were slaves we belonged to people they would sell us like they sell horses and cows and hogs and all like that have an auction bench
POD1000000016_S0000096	put you up on the bench and beat on you the same as you are beating on a cat you know
POD1000000016_S0000097	but still i do not like talking about it because it makes people feel bad
POD1000000016_S0000099	so you kind of have to put yourself in the scene it is june of 1776 and thomas jefferson
POD1000000016_S0000100	at the very young age of 33 years old has been tasked with drafting the document that is going to declare to the world why the british north american colonies the 13 colonies want to break off from the british empire
POD1000000016_S0000101	he goes to philadelphia and rents 2 rooms on the edge of town along the river and sits down to draft what we all know now as the declaration of independence
POD1000000016_S0000102	when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
POD1000000016_S0000104	so he is sitting at this portable mahogany writing desk that he carries with him and he pulls out some paper and a very nice quill pen
POD1000000016_S0000105	and he starts to write these words that almost every american can recite by heart
POD1000000016_S0000106	declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self evident
POD1000000016_S0000108	they become some of the most famous words in the english language
POD1000000016_S0000109	that they are endowed by their creator with certain
POD1000000016_S0000111	life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness that is what makes us unique that is what makes us strong the shared values that we all hold so dear
POD1000000016_S0000113	but what most americans do not know is that while he is writing these lofty words for liberation
POD1000000016_S0000114	he had brought with him one of the many enslaved people whom he owned in order to serve him and to keep him comfortable now that enslaved person was a teenager
POD1000000016_S0000115	and that teenager was the half brother of thomas jefferson is wife what that means is thomas jefferson is father in law had children with one of the women that he enslaved
POD1000000016_S0000116	so actually he was thomas jefferson is brother in law and so as he is writing these ideals he knows that they will not apply even to his own family members
POD1000000016_S0000118	at the time that thomas jefferson is drafting the declaration 150 years have passed since those 1st africans were sold into virginia
POD1000000016_S0000119	the enslaved population has grown from 20 to now 50 people fully 15th of the population is now enslaved
POD1000000016_S0000120	it has grown from a conditional institution where some of those 1st 20 were able to become free after a term of time to one where black people are born into it
POD1000000016_S0000121	they die into it and they pass that status on to their children you now have generations of black people who have never known a day of freedom and who will never know a day of freedom
POD1000000016_S0000122	and yet when thomas jefferson is contemporaries talk in public about why the colonists need to be free from england they refer to themselves as slaves
POD1000000016_S0000123	as slaves to the king of england and so the colonists are being criticized in newspapers for this obvious duplicity by those who do not believe that they should break off from the british empire
POD1000000016_S0000124	one of them writes how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for freedom from the drivers of negroes another writes to benjamin franklin and says perhaps you should ask the people who are actually enslaved what slavery is like
POD1000000016_S0000125	thomas jefferson of course is deeply aware of the hypocrisy and aware of the criticism of the hypocrisy so as he is drafting the declaration
POD1000000016_S0000126	he includes a passage in there where he actually blames the king of england for introducing slavery into the colonies he calls slavery a crime and he says that the king of england committed this crime
POD1000000016_S0000127	but that is not our fault it was not our doing this is just one more thing that the king of england did to wrong us so he brings this document to the continental congress
POD1000000016_S0000128	and it does not take long before delegates from the carolinas and from georgia look at that language about slavery and one can imagine they said what the hell are you doing
POD1000000016_S0000129	and they say that there is no way that they are going to sign this document as long as that passage about slavery remains and so it is struck and the 13 colonies sign the declaration
POD1000000016_S0000130	and the declaration goes out into the world without mentioning slavery at all and we start the revolutionary war
POD1000000016_S0000132	somehow miraculously these 13 scrappy colonies managed to defeat one of the most powerful empires in the world and we become a new nation
POD1000000016_S0000133	and so the colonists gather and they try to figure out the language that they are going to create in the founding document that we of course come to know as the constitution but now they have a problem
POD1000000016_S0000134	they were trying to leave behind an old country that they believed was antithetical to freedom and create a new one that they believe would be defined by freedom
POD1000000016_S0000135	this was a country that was going to be based on individual rights on a government of the people for the people and by the people
POD1000000016_S0000136	but this was also a place that at this time was still practicing the institution of slavery
POD1000000016_S0000137	and so the colonists have a choice to make are they going to be the country of their ideals the ideals that they were putting to paper a country based on the idea that all men were created equal
POD1000000016_S0000138	and if they were going to be that country then they were going to have to abolish the institution of slavery or were they going to be wedded to the institution of slavery because they depended so heavily on the wealth that was being generated from it
POD1000000016_S0000139	and in that case they can not really write the document that they want to write and so what they do is they decide that they are going to try to have it both ways
POD1000000016_S0000140	and they bake that contradiction right into the constitution both codifying and protecting the institution of slavery but never actually mentioning the word
POD1000000016_S0000141	and so they have written what is perhaps the most radical constitution in the world and from the beginning they knew they were going to violate its most essential principles
POD1000000016_S0000143	they call this new country a democracy but it was not one not yet
POD1000000016_S0000145	on august 14 1862 abraham lincoln invites 5 free black men to the white house for a meeting
POD1000000016_S0000146	they are part of the black elite in washington d c and he wants to have a conversation with them
POD1000000016_S0000147	the civil war has been going on for about a year and abraham lincoln is worried because the war is not going well and because it is not going well he is feeling like he might have to do something drastic
POD1000000016_S0000148	he is considering taking this very radical step of liberating all of the enslaved people who are in the confederate states
POD1000000016_S0000149	and he is thinking about doing this as a war tactic understanding that if he takes away the south is labor force that might cripple them or at least the threat of it would force them to remain in the union
POD1000000016_S0000150	but he is also concerned about what it might mean to suddenly free 40 enslaved people and what the consequences of that might be
POD1000000016_S0000152	i can imagine these 5 distinguished men are very excited to get lincoln is invitation they are abolitionists they have been pressuring lincoln to abolish slavery
POD1000000016_S0000153	but when they get there they are greeted by president lincoln and another man his name is james mitchell now james mitchell is a new employee he is only been at the white house for a couple of days
POD1000000016_S0000154	and his job is a new job and it is called commissioner of immigration now that is immigration with an e meaning his job was not to help people to enter the country but to help people to exit it
POD1000000016_S0000156	lincoln does not waste any time according to documents that recount what happened that day
POD1000000016_S0000158	he tells the men that he had gotten funds from congress to ship black people once they had been freed to some other country
POD1000000016_S0000160	and then lincoln said you and we are different races your race suffer very greatly many of them by living amongst us while ours suffer from your presence
POD1000000016_S0000161	in a word he said we suffer on each side
POD1000000016_S0000163	we are taught to think of abraham lincoln as the great emancipator and he was but the truth is like many white americans he was opposed to slavery because it was a cruel and unjust institution in opposition to this nation is ideals
POD1000000016_S0000164	but he was also opposed to black political and social equality as he said in a speech that he gave in 1853 he considered black people a quote troublesome presence
POD1000000016_S0000165	and that they were incompatible with a democracy that was designed for white people as he said in that speech
POD1000000016_S0000166	we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not
POD1000000016_S0000168	as those 5 black men stood in the white house i wonder what it must have felt like
POD1000000016_S0000170	these men had been fighting for the liberations of 10s and had waited for this moment only to be told that once they were granted their freedom they were going to be asked to leave the country of their birth
POD1000000016_S0000172	and to make it even worse lincoln then tells them that it is their fault that the country is fighting a civil war at all
POD1000000016_S0000173	he says
POD1000000016_S0000174	that is why the president said it is better for us both therefore to be separated
POD1000000016_S0000176	so lincoln ends the meeting and one of the men tells him that they will go back and consider his proposal lincoln then tells them take your full time no hurry at all
POD1000000016_S0000178	after that meeting those men made it clear that they were not interested in taking lincoln up on his offer to leave the country of their birth
POD1000000016_S0000180	there is a quote by a different group of black abolitionists that really sums up the way that most black americans felt and that quote said this is our home and this is our country
POD1000000016_S0000181	beneath its side lie the bones of our fathers here we were born and here we will die
POD1000000016_S0000183	after everything that black americans have been through in this country that they did not immediately take up lincoln is offer and go somewhere else and start over is really an astounding testimony to their belief in the american ideals
POD1000000016_S0000185	by choosing to stay black people were saying this is our country we are american and we are actually going to work to make these founding ideals a reality
POD1000000016_S0000187	and in the years that followed after the civil war ends a very short period called reconstruction began
POD1000000016_S0000189	and so you see the formerly enslaved pushing their white allies in congress to start to change our founding document and to actually resolve those contradictions that were baked in
POD1000000016_S0000190	they do this through getting amendments passed and of course amendments are the way that we change our constitution
POD1000000016_S0000192	so of course the very 1st amendment that they have to pass is the 13th amendment which abolishes the institution of slavery
POD1000000016_S0000193	and what is interesting about that is this is actually the 1st time that the word slavery is mentioned in the constitution is in the amendment that finally abolishes it
POD1000000016_S0000195	it also ensures for the 1st time that the laws cannot treat people differently based on their race this is called the equal protection clause
POD1000000016_S0000196	and this clause will be used again and again really all the way up until now to guarantee that all americans are treated as equal citizens
POD1000000016_S0000198	and finally they passed the 15th amendment which probably is the most important amendment when we are considering what a democracy is supposed to be the 15th amendment guaranteed the right to vote no matter what your race is
POD1000000016_S0000199	now it did not include women at that time but it certainly set the stage and it for the 1st time guaranteed that whether you were born a person who was enslaved whether you are white or you were black you had the right to exercise your vote in this democracy
POD1000000016_S0000201	the only reason we saw all of these gains in the south was because there were federal troops there and those federal troops were holding back the violence of white southerners who were not interested in seeing these gains
POD1000000016_S0000202	this all changes with the presidential election of 1876
POD1000000016_S0000204	it was a contested election and rutherford b hayes is the republican candidate and remember back then it was republicans who were the progressive party and they were the party of lincoln that was working to pass all of this progressive legislation
POD1000000016_S0000206	but rutherford b hayes really wants to win this election
POD1000000016_S0000207	and so he makes a deal with the democrats in congress that if they give him their electoral votes he will withdraw the federal troops from the south and end reconstruction
POD1000000016_S0000209	so he makes the deal and the troops leave and we immediately see white southerners implement a campaign to force black people back into the position that they had been in before reconstruction
POD1000000016_S0000211	the suppression of black life over the next 5 decades would be so devastating that it would come to be known as the great nadir the 2nd slavery
POD1000000016_S0000213	tell you the truth when i think of it today i do not know how i am living i am the oldest one that i know that is living but still i am thankful to the lord
POD1000000016_S0000215	because people are free they are all for thanks
POD1000000016_S0000217	if i thought that i would ever be a slave again i would take a gun and just end it all right away because you are nothing but a dog
POD1000000016_S0000219	nara sambharbha
POD1000000016_S0000221	the day of days for america and her allies crowds before the white house await the announcement
POD1000000016_S0000222	i have received this afternoon a message from the japanese government which specifies the unconditional surrender of japan
POD1000000016_S0000223	reporters rush out to relay the news to an anxious world and touch off celebrations throughout the country joy is unconfined
POD1000000016_S0000225	it is february of 1946 and a young black man is sitting on a bus watching the georgia pines fly past the windows he is on his way to see his wife and he is probably very excited because he has been away at war and he has not seen her in a very long time
POD1000000016_S0000226	he had been fighting for this country in world war ii and just that day he had been honorably discharged for his service but he is a black man who is returning to the jim crow south
POD1000000016_S0000228	what happened on that day is a story that will be told across the country
POD1000000016_S0000229	good morning this is orson welles speaking i would like to read you an affidavit
POD1000000016_S0000230	it was a story that would actually change the course of history
POD1000000016_S0000232	he is riding the bus through georgia
POD1000000016_S0000234	he wants to get off and use the restroom
POD1000000016_S0000236	the bus driver gets upset with him and they have a little bit of an argument porter does not think much of it he goes to the bathroom runs back to the bus and the bus keeps going but then a few miles down the road the bus stops
POD1000000016_S0000237	and the bus driver gets off the bus and then calls and tells woodard that he needs to get off the bus as well so woodard gets off the bus and before he can even utter a word
POD1000000016_S0000239	he is struck in the head by a police officer
POD1000000016_S0000241	and the blows keep coming and they keep coming to the point that water loses consciousness
POD1000000016_S0000243	woodard is still wearing his crisp army uniform he has been discharged just a few hours earlier when he comes to he is in a jail
POD1000000016_S0000245	i woke up next morning and could not see
POD1000000016_S0000246	he was beaten so severely by that police officer that he would never see again
POD1000000016_S0000248	so waters beating was not at all unusual world war ii had done exactly what many white people had feared
POD1000000016_S0000249	that once black people were allowed to fight in the military and when they traveled abroad and they experienced what it was like not to live under a system of racial apartheid that it would be much harder to control them when they came back
POD1000000016_S0000250	black men in their uniforms were seen as being unduly proud so these men who had served their country who would come home proudly wearing the uniform to show their service for their country
POD1000000016_S0000251	would find that this actually made them a target of some of the most severe violence but what was unusual was what happened after wodard is case was picked up by the naacp and they take him on a bit of a tour
POD1000000016_S0000252	where they are saying look what happened to this man who served his country
POD1000000016_S0000254	and that is largely seen as one of the sparks of the modern civil rights movement
POD1000000016_S0000256	the 2nd sustained movement of black people trying to secure equal rights before the law and an equal place in this democracy
POD1000000016_S0000258	and in 1968 350 years after the introduction of the 1st enslaved africans into the colonies
POD1000000016_S0000260	congress passes the last of the great civil rights legislation
POD1000000016_S0000262	it ends legal discrimination on the basis of race from all aspects of american life
POD1000000016_S0000264	we often think of the civil rights movement as being about black rights but the civil rights movement was never just about the rights of black people it was about making the ideals of the constitution whole
POD1000000016_S0000265	and so when you look at the laws born out of black resistance these laws are guaranteeing rights for all americans
POD1000000016_S0000266	this experience which black americans were having did not go unnoticed by the rest of america
POD1000000016_S0000267	i mean basically every other rights struggle that we have seen
POD1000000016_S0000269	disability rights gay rights women is rights
POD1000000016_S0000270	that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination
POD1000000016_S0000271	all come from the efforts of the black civil rights struggles
POD1000000016_S0000274	so we are raised to think about 1776 as the beginning of our democracy but when that ship arrives on the horizon at point comfort in 1619
POD1000000016_S0000275	that decision made by the colonists to purchase that group of 20 to 30 human beings that was a beginning too
POD1000000016_S0000276	and it would actually be those very people who were denied citizenship in their own country who were denied the protections of our founding documents who would fight the hardest and most successfully to make those ideals real
POD1000000016_S0000277	not just for themselves but for all americans it is black people who have been the perfectors of this democracy
POD1000000016_S0000279	when i was a kid i must have been in 5th or 6th grade our teacher gave us an assignment it was a social studies class and we were learning about different places that people came from
POD1000000016_S0000280	and this was her way of kind of telling the story of the great american melting pot so she told us all to research our ancestral land and to write a small report about it and then to draw a flag
POD1000000016_S0000281	i remember kind of looking up and making eye contact with the other black girl who was in the class because we did not really have an ancestral land that we knew of
POD1000000016_S0000282	slavery had made it so that we did not know where we came from in africa we did not have a specific country and we could say that we were from the whole continent
POD1000000016_S0000283	but even so there is no such thing as an african flag and so i remember going to the globe by my teacher is desk it was on the window pane along the left side of the classroom
POD1000000016_S0000284	and spinning it to the continent of africa and just picking a random african country
POD1000000016_S0000285	so i went back to my desk and i drew that random african countries flag and i wrote a report about it and i felt ashamed i felt ashamed one because i was lying
POD1000000016_S0000286	but i also felt ashamed because i felt like i should have some other country and that all the other kids could trace their roots elsewhere and i could only trace my roots to the country that had enslaved us
POD1000000016_S0000287	i wish now that i could go back and talk to my younger self and tell her that she should not be ashamed
POD1000000016_S0000288	that this is her ancestral home that she should be as proud to be an american as her dad was
POD1000000016_S0000289	and that she should boldly and proudly draw those stars and stripes and claim this country as her own
POD1000000019_S0000000	this episode of cocaine and rhinestones is the 2nd episode in a 3 part series on harper valley pta
POD1000000019_S0000001	if this is the 1st episode of the podcast you are listening to i would recommend going back and at least listening to last week is episode before this one even if you are just a huge genie c reilly fan and you do not even know who shelby singleton is
POD1000000019_S0000002	if you have not heard last week is episode you will be missing out on a lot of context and i am not going to be doing very much recapping
POD1000000019_S0000004	last week we spent some time looking at how far outside of the box shelby singleton was willing to go for a hit song now are we sure we know what a hit song is how to define it
POD1000000019_S0000006	it is safe to say any song that hits the top 10 could be called a hit right okay this past may when i began working on this podcast i spent about a week listening to every song to ever go number one on the billboard country chart
POD1000000019_S0000007	in chronological order from the 1st year the chart existed in 1944 until this show is cutoff point in the year 2000
POD1000000019_S0000008	i needed to make sure i would heard them all to build a timeline of what happened in the mainstream of country music in the 1900s there were quite a few songs i would never heard before
POD1000000019_S0000009	unless you have purposefully sat down to give yourself the same experience or spent the past 70 something years of your life glued to country radio the same thing is true for you number one songs hit songs completely absent from our personal experience of country music
POD1000000019_S0000010	even when the song at number one the week before or the week after is one of our favorite songs of all time now imagine how many top 10 hits between 1944 and the year 2000 we have not heard
POD1000000019_S0000011	probably 100s of hit country songs you have never heard in your life i have never heard in my life so we can say all hits are not created equal not in the mind of the audience and definitely not in the mind of the record industry
POD1000000019_S0000012	i should give a disclaimer here that commercial success is obviously not everything obviously not a gauge of artistic merit
POD1000000019_S0000013	there are brilliant country artists who have never had a hit in their lives that is not what we are talking about today
POD1000000019_S0000014	but if we are saying top 10 singles are hits and i believe we should say that then just having hits was not enough for this industry you had to have more hits bigger hits it was called the record industry
POD1000000019_S0000015	move units make money or get out of the way for the next artist who will always be scaling up anything that is not as good as or better than the last thing you did
POD1000000019_S0000016	you might as well have not done it and you will probably end up wishing you had not
POD1000000019_S0000017	i think the worst thing that could happen to a country recording artist in this climate is for their very 1st single to become a number one hit you can not do any better than that the only way to improve on that is to stay number one for more weeks
POD1000000019_S0000018	sell more copies even if you manage to do that it is only a matter of time until you put out a song that only goes to number 2 or number 5
POD1000000019_S0000019	but that is still a hit 0 sure sure it is or maybe it is the beginning of the end maybe you just do not have the stuff anymore kiddo we got to get those numbers back up to where they were or well it aint going to be good
POD1000000019_S0000020	imagine you are a new country artist and your very 1st single goes number one country and pop how screwed do you think you are there are not many people you can ask about this
POD1000000019_S0000021	billy swan is one genie c reilly the singer of harper valley pta is the other one those are the only 2 people alive who have had their 1st single go number one country and pop
POD1000000019_S0000022	neither one of them ever had another number one song
POD1000000019_S0000024	i have heard them both called one hit wonders
POD1000000019_S0000025	billy swan never even got back in the top 10 although he did also write his one hit i can help and elvis presley recorded that so i assume billy is doing fine
POD1000000019_S0000027	genie c riley put out 5 more top 10 hits 4 of which crossed over into the billboard hot 100 these are country songs by the way
POD1000000019_S0000028	none of that stripped down nashville sound stuff the industry bent over backwards to push it pop audiences genie was achieving crossover success with one of the most unsophisticated texas twangs you have ever heard
POD1000000019_S0000029	and a hardcore country sound behind it that is not what one hit wonders do
POD1000000019_S0000031	but because her 1st single sold maybe 60 records
POD1000000019_S0000032	nothing she did after that mattered
POD1000000019_S0000034	jeannie carolyn stevenson was born in a small texas town in 1945 in 1962 while still a senior in high school she married her boyfriend mickey riley and became jeannie carolyn riley so c stands for carolyn
POD1000000019_S0000035	her uncle was a country guitar player and songwriter nobody you would know but in the tiny town of anson texas just the fact that he had gone to nashville to record in a real studio was a big deal
POD1000000019_S0000036	or at least jeannie seems to think people thought so her husband mickey knew it was jeannie is dream to move to nashville and become a famous singer he was supportive of that
POD1000000019_S0000037	but they decided to wait until jeannie finished high school and save some money for the move then jeannie found out she was pregnant and they had a baby in 1966
POD1000000019_S0000038	yes that is 4 years after they got married and unless it took jeannie 4 years to pass 12th grade the math does not add up at all for her to use the baby as an excuse for why they stayed in texas i will get to it in a 2nd
POD1000000019_S0000040	one day jeannie says she gets a letter from the great pedal steel player weldon myrick who would seen her sing at a local jamboree and just had to write her to say that he thought of jeannie is singing every time he heard connie smith sing
POD1000000019_S0000041	once a day
POD1000000019_S0000043	now in just a minute you may decide jeannie is making this part up but it is possible that it is true later you will hear she was able to sing in a somewhat similar style to connie smith so weldon is letter gives her a little encouragement
POD1000000019_S0000044	the next time uncle johnny goes to nashville he invites the entire family on the trip and they go still in 1966 here 13 people pile into 2 cars to make the trip
POD1000000019_S0000045	up in nashville they drive around lower broadway to look at tootsie is orchid lounge ernest hubs record shop and the ryman auditorium all that country music tourist stuff
POD1000000019_S0000046	uncle johnny gets them backstage at the grand ole opry and jeannie is all starstruck she gets an autograph from connie smith jackie phelps the guy you would later see playing guitar on haw takes uncle johnny aside to give him some advice
POD1000000019_S0000047	your little niece is a pretty country girl and i would like to save her and her husband some heartache if she has got talent tell her she does not have to sell her body to make it to the top she can make it if she knows the right people
POD1000000019_S0000048	but if she gets in with the wrong crowd they will destroy her and her home too
POD1000000019_S0000049	you are listening to cocaine and rhinestones the podcast about 20th century country music and the lies of those who gave it to us
POD1000000019_S0000050	my name is tyler mahan co i have heard these stories my whole life as far as i can tell okay freeze
POD1000000019_S0000051	genie c reilly is autobiography is really the only source i can use for this stuff and it is super sketchy to say the least
POD1000000019_S0000052	this is the 1st of several outlandish scenarios where famous people give her incredibly personal advice that is also so extremely specific
POD1000000019_S0000053	it is almost as if they can see into jeannie is actual future mere moments after meeting her for the very 1st time
POD1000000019_S0000054	you are a professional musician a colleague of yours brings his niece to see a show you take it upon yourself to call the guy aside and tell him to make sure to let his niece know not to be a hooker not likely
POD1000000019_S0000055	jeannie does go on to find herself in some bad situations and i do not doubt for a 2nd that they really happened but believing her about that does not mean i have to believe everything else she says
POD1000000019_S0000056	there is all these run ins with celebrities who seem to have psychic powers the timeline she presents often makes no sense fine but at least one major part of her story is deliberately misrepresented
POD1000000019_S0000057	she is blatantly lying about certain things there is even a note at the beginning of the book about how several names and some details have been changed to protect people
POD1000000019_S0000059	basically it could not be more clear that this autobiography is more like what you would call an autohagiography the hollywood movie version of these events
POD1000000019_S0000060	they might as well have printed based on a true story on the title page i should say this is one of those celebrity autobiographies that is written with the help of an author so you know it is possible this guy had a hand in these embellishments
POD1000000019_S0000061	you can make up your own mind that is what i will say but this is going to get real crazy so just please try to remember this
POD1000000019_S0000062	but here is an example of a small type of thing that i probably would not even mention if i only noticed it once or twice the book opens with her locking up the office building in nashville where she worked as a secretary
POD1000000019_S0000063	walking over to a recording studio and being greeted by shelby singleton handing her the lyrics of harbor valley pta we have got shelby saying it is just right for your voice tom hall has caught the angry mood of the country let us see if you can make it sing
POD1000000019_S0000064	the problem is as you will hear in a few minutes the entire week before this jeannie had been arguing with everyone about not liking this song and whether or not it would be released under her own name or a pseudonym
POD1000000019_S0000065	in the very next paragraph she says she would already studied the lyrics which she would have gotten from shelby why does she have shelby presenting the lyrics to her here with such pomp as if for the very 1st time
POD1000000019_S0000066	as if she is never heard this song before like i said small thing i would let it slide but this is a death by a 1000 cuts situation
POD1000000019_S0000067	there is at least one scene where 2 people go back and forth with lines of quoted dialog in a conversation that jeannie was not there for and could not possibly remember with such detail even if she was blessed with total recall over a decade after the fact
POD1000000019_S0000069	there is one more scene where she is driving her car while upset quote half blind from the tears she accidentally speeds over some railroad tracks just ahead of a crossing train and i am quoting here
POD1000000019_S0000070	the train loomed over me as i roared across the tracks missing my back bumper by less than a foot the vacuum created by the rushing locomotive and the rumbling wheels almost flipped my car over the screeching
POD1000000019_S0000072	half blind from tears yet she knows within a 12 inch margin of error how close a train passed to the back bumper of her car so that is what i am working with here and whatever you will see
POD1000000019_S0000073	okay we are still in nashville the night jeannie is uncle takes her backstage at the opry when they leave the opry that night doyle wilburn of the wilburn brothers has agreed to listen to jeannie sing
POD1000000019_S0000074	if they will come by the office of surefire his publishing company a few days later they drop in to the surefire office and meet johnny russell who is a staff songwriter there johnny russell listens to her sing
POD1000000019_S0000075	they decide to have her go in the studio that night and the next to record a 4 song demo tape they have a photographer take some pictures of her jeannie thinks all of this means she is on her way to becoming a star
POD1000000019_S0000076	the 2nd night of recording within 48 hours of meeting her johnny russell pulls jeannie and her husband mickey aside to tell them quote i have watched you kids ever since you got here and i need to say something to you
POD1000000019_S0000077	nashville is good to you when you are on top but it is a mean city too this business of wanting to be number one gets in your blood it consumes you until you can not think of anything else it is like drugs only worse
POD1000000019_S0000078	because there is nothing you can do to get rid of it you will leave your family you will leave your self respect you will do anything to reach the top and anything to stay there
POD1000000019_S0000079	i have seen it happen too many times most people think they are the exception they come in here with high morals and high ideals and lose them overnight the pressures are too much what i am saying is this
POD1000000019_S0000080	i do not think jeannie can make it here she has got a good voice and you are a fine young couple but this city will chew you up swallow the juice and spit you out like a dry hole on the street go back to texas and stay there
POD1000000019_S0000081	wow that is one hell of a monolog huh i do not know how anyone gets anything done in the music business when they are delivering fully polished 150 word speeches like that to everyone they have known for 48 hours
POD1000000019_S0000082	anyway after a week or so the texas crew heads back to texas doyle wilburn had told them the wilburns would be needing a female vocalist for their upcoming september tour of germany jeannie should expect their call
POD1000000019_S0000083	all through july she expects the call all through august she expects the call of course it never comes so she gets all bummed out until mickey comes home from work one day and tells her to start packing he is sick of seeing her mope around the house they are moving to nashville
POD1000000019_S0000084	as they cross the city limit sign into nashville she and mickey make a pact that they will always travel together as a family the baby 2 quote show business might chew up other folks and spit them onto the sidewalk but not us we would show them
POD1000000019_S0000085	we were going to make it together
POD1000000019_S0000087	this is the end of 1966 because of everyone jeannie starts having sex with and the fact that she changes their names
POD1000000019_S0000088	and the names of the companies they work for it gets really confusing to work out the specifics of what happens when and where for the next year
POD1000000019_S0000089	for instance she refers to her 1st manager paul perry as pete terry through her entire book because of the affair she later has with him this other guy gets named phil blackman and he is a big shot at black rose records
POD1000000019_S0000090	based out of new york phil blackman is our big bad wolf uncle johnny bought a gas station right before jeannie and mickey moved to nashville so that is where mickey starts working
POD1000000019_S0000091	they live in a motel room then a small apartment jeannie keeps calling surefire music to find out why they did not hire her for that wilburn brothers tour she eventually finds out that tour was canceled and then gets to work furthering her career by checking the mailbox
POD1000000019_S0000092	and waiting for the phone to ring she writes that she spends weeks waiting for the world to notice her resenting her husband for working 12 hour days at a gas station to support her and the baby while also begging him to move them to a bigger apartment closer to his work
POD1000000019_S0000094	one day she finally realizes she is going to have to actually try to get people to care that she exists she gets all dolled up and drives with her baby down to music row to look for this powerful woman she would heard of who was from a town in texas
POD1000000019_S0000095	25 miles away from where jeannie was from she apparently thinks she can meet this lady say hey i am from texas too and get a record deal or something
POD1000000019_S0000096	she has no idea where this lady is office is supposed to be she just starts walking into publishing companies to find out if that lady works there or not when some kid asks if she is trying to get a demo tape heard jeannie pulls out her tape and the kid takes a listen
POD1000000019_S0000097	he seems to like it plays it for his boss who says it sounds too much like loretta lynn and they tell jeannie to kick rocks she goes back to her car with the baby and cries then decides to drive over to the gas station where mickey works
POD1000000019_S0000098	when she gets there mickey is talking to a guy named jerry chestnut a rich guy who owns a vacuum cleaner business but also wants to be a songwriter
POD1000000019_S0000099	you have heard the song he would write a few years after this called a good year for the roses
POD1000000019_S0000101	mickey has a copy of genie is demo tape that he plays in the gas station just in case someone important happens to come in and hear it and care
POD1000000019_S0000102	chestnut is not really important yet but he did strike up a conversation and offer to play the demo tape for his friends at monument records a few days later he calls to say monument is interested
POD1000000019_S0000103	but they want to change genie is name because they are already doing well with genie seelie and let us not get carried away with the genies over here right our genie is not thrilled about this but
POD1000000019_S0000104	but jerry thinks they can get monument to back off the name change if they stay on it jeannie gets shown off at a dj convention introduced to everyone in town as tina stevens the next girl they are going to sign and do big things with
POD1000000019_S0000105	but then she gets forgotten about because apparently a major female artist on the label does not like genie or tina or whoever back to square one
POD1000000019_S0000106	jerry chestnut meets a radio dj named paul perry who knows phil blackman a made up name for a real important guy at black rose which is also a made up name for a real record label
POD1000000019_S0000107	remember this sentence that dj paul perry sends jeannie is demo and a promo picture to phil blackman in new york city
POD1000000019_S0000108	blackman expresses interest in recording genie when he comes to nashville sometime in january it ends up being early february of 1967 when genie walks into black rose is office for the 1st time
POD1000000019_S0000109	she writes literally nothing about the conversation only that she finds bill blackman very attractive and she leaves with a contract that night she begins fantasizing that blackman will fall in love with her
POD1000000019_S0000110	within a week in reality they have kissed blackman goes back to new york city for business when he returns a few weeks later he and jeannie start having a full fledged affair
POD1000000019_S0000111	now i do not like dwelling on this soap opera stuff unless the story cannot be told without it so here is the relevant information that dj named paul perry becomes genie is 1st manager
POD1000000019_S0000112	she technically gets a single released on black rose records but it is only technically released no money is put into promoting it and not even genie thinks it is any good
POD1000000019_S0000113	but she does think she and this rich powerful man are in love with each other so she is not too worried about that record
POD1000000019_S0000115	then one day in blackman is apartment jeannie is laying naked on the couch after having sex with him when she is suddenly blinded by flashes of bright light there is blackman holding a camera with a strobe flash attachment
POD1000000019_S0000116	genie freaks out he tells her there is no film in the camera she asks if he really loves her he laughs at her says mean things to her about how stupid she is and she leaves crying
POD1000000019_S0000117	fast forward to 6 months later it is early in the fall of 1967 genie is in las vegas for a week as johnny paycheck is opener paycheck is on his way up after having his 1st top 10 hit the year before with the lovin machine
POD1000000019_S0000119	phil blackman is also in las vegas but genie manages to resist his advances
POD1000000019_S0000120	fast forward again to january of 1968 jeannie gets blackman to release her from her contract so she can go record for little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000121	this is the record label started by johnny paycheck and his producer aubrey mayhew who had heard jeannie sing in vegas and decided he would like to record her
POD1000000019_S0000122	aubrey does record her a single is released on little darlin but like the black rose single with phil blackman it is only technically released not really promoted because they quote wound up in contract difficulties
POD1000000019_S0000123	i will come back to this
POD1000000019_S0000125	meanwhile jerry chestnut has decided to get out of the vacuum cleaner business and all the way into the music business opening up a music row office for his publishing company
POD1000000019_S0000126	he hires jeannie as a secretary which is where she is working when a songwriter friend asked her to sing on the demo of his new song he wants shelby singleton at plantation records to hear
POD1000000019_S0000127	i could not find a recording of genie singing it but i found the songwriter singing it himself so you can try to imagine what genie would have sounded like on the demo
POD1000000019_S0000128	clark bentley is old town drunk comes out on plantation records in 1968
POD1000000019_S0000130	when shelby hears the demo he is more interested in the voice of the singer than the song if you listened to last week is episode this is the part where he wants to meet that singer to see if she has got the image he is looking for to sing harper valley pta
POD1000000019_S0000132	here on jeannie is side she wants to listen to harper valley pta before she agrees to anything her manager paul perry thinks she is crazy for not getting on board sight unseen but he brings her a tape she does not like the song
POD1000000019_S0000133	just does not like something about it says it sounds like a soft redo of ode to billy joe now paul perry and all her friends think she is crazy she agrees to meet with shelby and there is something she does not like about him too
POD1000000019_S0000134	shelby tells her they can make a pop hit together but they will have to change her name because there is too many genies in nashville same old story he wants to call her rhonda renee
POD1000000019_S0000135	she is thinking about that when perry says if genie does not take this deal then he can not represent her anymore it is not going to get any better than this she signs the papers goes home and cries about it
POD1000000019_S0000136	her husband mickey comes home to find her upset hears the story about them wanting to change her name calls paul perry and yells at him to tear up the contract jeannie is not doing it
POD1000000019_S0000137	the next day all the business people convince her they will let her keep her own name if she just comes in on friday after work to record this damn song the entire day friday jeannie is pissed off at the world
POD1000000019_S0000138	she feels like she is being backed into a corner and talked into doing something she does not want to do on top of that she is sure everyone is lying to her about getting to use her real name
POD1000000019_S0000139	still she goes to the studio channels her anger into the song and nails it on the 2nd take
POD1000000019_S0000141	shelby tells jeannie they will use her middle initial to make her stand out more from the other jeannies and add an i to her 1st name so people know it is not pronounced jean
POD1000000019_S0000142	finding out she really does not have to be ronda rene plus the fact that everyone in the room seems certain she just cut a massive hit song improves jeannie is mood
POD1000000019_S0000143	she calls her mother at one in the morning to tell her she just recorded a song that is going to be the number one song in the country
POD1000000019_S0000144	the masters are mixed and sent to the pressing plant on saturday morning genie spends monday handwriting 100s of personalized notes to go with promo copies to djs all over america
POD1000000019_S0000145	any time she comes to her own name or the name of a song she switches from black ink to red so it stands out on the page a station in ohio plays the single 26 times in one day other stations ban it because they do not like her uppity tone
POD1000000019_S0000146	love it or hate it everyone talks about it according to jeannie she and mickey take a copy over to ralph emery at wsm
POD1000000019_S0000147	this does not necessarily conflict with jerry kennedy is story about shelby taking over an acetate the night of the session genie would want ralph to have a real copy of the record but then genie says ralph tells mickey you all be really careful
POD1000000019_S0000148	so many families break up as soon as the singer hits the big time
POD1000000019_S0000149	the next friday they are in philadelphia for jeannie to sing her song on tv saturday new york city jeannie is with mickey paul perry and his wife shelby and a dozen other business people from nashville
POD1000000019_S0000150	a real entourage they stay in nice hotels drink champagne order room service and leave huge tips at dinners genie does not realize how all this works until later
POD1000000019_S0000151	when she finds out she is the one paying for all of that genie and mickey do not need help spending the money they are throwing down major cash on clothing jewelry hairstyles cars all the usual rock star stuff
POD1000000019_S0000152	a week after new york they are in florida doing a show with waylon jennings out of nowhere waylon tells jeannie that she will not stay married to mickey for long because he just do not fit the scene
POD1000000019_S0000153	if you ever need to find out exactly what is wrong with your life all you have to do is go stand by a country musician for a few minutes they are all psychic and chomping at the bit to give you advice
POD1000000019_S0000155	anyway pretty soon jeannie starts spending too much time with her manager paul perry one night they are sitting around holding hands and perry is talking about how careful jeannie has to be now that she is on top
POD1000000019_S0000156	he sure hopes she does not have anything in her past that could come back to haunt her you know like nudie pictures taken by phil blackman
POD1000000019_S0000158	back in nashville 1st thing monday morning genie heads over to black rose records there is blackman in his office packing up a stack of brand new genie c reilly records
POD1000000019_S0000159	made from her old sessions with him now that jeanie has got the biggest hit in the nation these records will sell
POD1000000019_S0000160	they argue she demands the naked pictures he plays stupid at 1st but then says it will take him a couple days to get them come back wednesday skip to wednesday
POD1000000019_S0000161	blackman has got a manila envelope like you see in every movie about a private detective and he wants to give it to jeannie but 1st she has got to sign a new piece of paper saying she will not sue him for releasing her old recordings
POD1000000019_S0000162	see he is legally allowed to do that and she will even get paid royalties and everything it is just that he lost their original contract so sign here and here and you can have those pictures
POD1000000019_S0000163	of course she signs the thing then without even looking in the manila envelope she asks him to burn it which he does in front of her by the time she gets home
POD1000000019_S0000164	half an hour later the news is reporting that black rose records has filed a lawsuit against harper valley pta is singer and record label for breach of contract
POD1000000019_S0000165	okay here is the thing phil blackman and aubrey mayhew are at least partially the same person
POD1000000019_S0000166	you do remember aubrey right johnny paycheck is producer that heard jeannie sing in vegas wanted to record her and that is why she got blackman to let her out of her contract in the 1st place
POD1000000019_S0000167	yeah that is all bullshit
POD1000000019_S0000168	phil blackman and black rose records are not fake names for someone and something that happened before genie got involved with aubrey mayhew and little darlin
POD1000000019_S0000169	jeannie tells the same story 2 different ways as a red herring black rose records is little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000170	which is also the explanation for why jeannie would be in las vegas opening up for johnny paycheck when all she is supposedly done is one barely released single for black rose records
POD1000000019_S0000171	if you were to rewind this episode and listen to the part about how phil blackman came into genie c reilly is life you would be listening to the story of how aubrey mayhew came into her life
POD1000000019_S0000172	you would be listening to the story of how genie c reilly came to be signed to little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000173	i know this because it is described exactly the same way in court documents related to the lawsuit jeannie just told us about
POD1000000019_S0000174	quote as to little darlin records the amended and supplemental bill asserts that prior to the time complainant was incorporated its president aubrey mayhew did business in new york new york
POD1000000019_S0000175	an individual under the proprietary name of little darlin records that his 1st knowledge of defendant riley was a letter addressed to him on the date of december 8 1966 by paul perry
POD1000000019_S0000176	and closing the tape and photo mentioned
POD1000000019_S0000177	there was no barely released black rose single before the barely released little darlin single there was one barely released single
POD1000000019_S0000178	the contract difficulties jeannie mentions to explain why her little darlin single suffered the same fate as her black rose single that is this lawsuit the court document sheds more light on this
POD1000000019_S0000179	in response to mayhew is lawsuit genie tells the court that mayhew was never convinced she had enough talent to succeed as a recording artist
POD1000000019_S0000180	and did not undertake to produce any records of her voice for general distribution
POD1000000019_S0000181	in other words aubrey mayhew did not think jeannie was that good of a singer he was using her as little more than a session vocalist for demo tapes he needed done anyway while letting her believe she was a real recording artist
POD1000000019_S0000182	genie seems to think that one single was just him going through the motions to string her along and she is probably right
POD1000000019_S0000183	speaking very strictly harper valley pta is not her debut single as i said it was in the intro of this episode but her 1st single may never have been meant for an audience larger than her immediate circle of family and friends
POD1000000019_S0000184	something physical for genie to play pretend with to keep the whole charade going it was called you write the music credited to gene reilly quote unquote released on little darlin records in 1967
POD1000000019_S0000186	aubrey is 1st mistake was signing jeannie to a real recording contract which stipulated that she be recorded 4 times a year a stipulation not met by using her for demo sessions
POD1000000019_S0000187	his 2nd mistake was releasing her from her contract on april 3rd of 19684 months before she recorded harper valley pta
POD1000000019_S0000188	now here are the 2 big questions i do not think i can or should even try to answer did aubrey mayhew and genie c reilly have an affair
POD1000000019_S0000189	and did aubrey mayhew take naked photographs of genie c reilly without her consent and then blackmail her
POD1000000019_S0000190	technically genie has never alleged either of these things against aubrey mayhew
POD1000000019_S0000191	that was phil blackman i am going to play it safe and point out that it is possible phil blackman is meant as an amalgamation of more than one person
POD1000000019_S0000192	i am not in any way a professional investigator all i did was read a bunch of publicly available information and match it to what jeannie wrote in her book
POD1000000019_S0000193	as far as i can tell i am the 1st reader of genie is autobiography who cared enough to take the time to look into this or at least i am the 1st one to talk about it
POD1000000019_S0000194	searching jeannie and aubrey is names together only brings up information about them having worked together and information about this lawsuit but listen even if phil blackman is 100% aubrey mayhew
POD1000000019_S0000195	and even if we choose to 100% believe everything jeannie says about him that still does not mean aubrey mayhew took those pictures jeannie says she had him burn the envelope without looking inside
POD1000000019_S0000196	she even brings up the possibility herself that the envelope could have been empty
POD1000000019_S0000197	it does not look like any pornographic photographs were mentioned in the courtroom at all
POD1000000019_S0000198	the case was ruled in favor of shelby singleton and jeannie c riley
POD1000000019_S0000199	back in the business of promoting their hit single genie gets sent to charm school to learn how to walk talk and act on stage
POD1000000019_S0000200	then she is sent on tour concerts talk shows radio shows live tv appearances her hometown names a day in april genie c riley day and there is a big ceremony for that
POD1000000019_S0000201	she gets to pick wild mountain berries with glen campbell on tv
POD1000000019_S0000203	she gets to live her dream of performing on the grand ole opry
POD1000000019_S0000205	but then she gets her 1st royalty check and finds out how much of the money being spent is hers basically all of it she is always expected to hang out and be nice to industry people
POD1000000019_S0000206	one night there is a scene with mickey when a random suit at a party is too persistent in trying to get genie to dance with him mickey grabs the guy is wrist and tells him to back off
POD1000000019_S0000207	later shelby tells jeannie that mickey needs to stay home if he can not control himself and mickey is banished from the road
POD1000000019_S0000208	if you are starting to get the idea that jeannie is always thought of as little more than a puppet for the people behind the scenes of her career i would say that seems accurate
POD1000000019_S0000210	now aside from the song itself the biggest impact genie c riley had on country music with harper valley pta was in fashion
POD1000000019_S0000212	it seems ridiculous today but in the late 60s that line in the song about the single mother wearing miniskirts that in itself was enough to make a lot of country music fans gasp and turn off the radio
POD1000000019_S0000213	and while the song is actually sung by the daughter character who does not dress that way every time you see genie see riley she looks like missus johnson
POD1000000019_S0000215	her style or more accurately the style she was made to wear would best be described as maud like nancy sinatra in her boots are made for walking phase
POD1000000019_S0000216	way before any other women in country music were dressing that way we are talking miniskirts go go boots and in october of 1968 the 1st year the cma awards were televised
POD1000000019_S0000217	a ridiculous dress
POD1000000019_S0000219	the ruffles start halfway up her ribcage and poof way out like they would to make a bell shape down to the ground but then it all just stops halfway down her thighs showing off legs and high heel cowgirl boots
POD1000000019_S0000221	after seeing the dress but before the show she called shelby singleton to yell at him in the middle of her tirade after she tells him she is not miss harper valley pta
POD1000000019_S0000222	she is an artist shelby cuts her off to say you are not an artist baby you are a commodity a mini skirted silver booted commodity now be there early we have got a show to rehearse
POD1000000019_S0000223	that is one exchange that i do not doubt for a 2nd happened just like that
POD1000000019_S0000225	the rest of jeannie is book is about her struggles with infidelity and conversion to religion more people seem to have mystical psychic powers
POD1000000019_S0000226	like after a divorce from mickey a random sales clerk in a department store somewhere stops jeannie to say your ex husband still loves you god wants you to go back to him bullshit like that
POD1000000019_S0000227	she tells the story of the 1st time she tries pot having an intensely spiritual vision that sends her into a fugue state for close to 24 hours and sounds more like an ayahuasca trip than any weed i have ever smoked
POD1000000019_S0000228	from the nightmare she describes you would expect that to be the only time she ever toked up but this video clip of ralph emery interviewing her seems to suggest otherwise
POD1000000019_S0000230	so i want to get away from her autobiography for the rest of this episode and talk more about the music genie made after her hit because that last sentence is pretty typical of the way people talk about genie c reilly is career
POD1000000019_S0000231	reference to her hit as if she had only one a one hit wonder if you will
POD1000000019_S0000233	while it is true she never took another song to number one on both pop and country charts not many people have ever done that
POD1000000019_S0000234	the only other woman to do that in the 1900s is dolly parton with 9 to 5 in 1981 making jeannie the 1st woman to ever do it if you do not count the farce with little darlin records
POD1000000019_S0000235	which you should not she is the only woman to do it with her debut single it is so unfair to judge the rest of her output against that that is like mocking a rookie basketball player for only breaking a world record one time
POD1000000019_S0000236	jeannie is follow up single to harper valley pta was called the girl most likely
POD1000000019_S0000237	sticking with the formula it is another song about prejudice in a small town this time it is the girl who everyone thought would be the 1st one to get in that special kind of trouble only a teenage girl can get in
POD1000000019_S0000238	only turns out it is the miss goody 2 shoes of the town who gets knocked up by the town doctor is son instead
POD1000000019_S0000240	it went to number 6 on the country chart and number 55 on the billboard hot 100 i would call that a hit song
POD1000000019_S0000242	after that aubrey mayhew put out an album consisting of everything he had sung by jeannie during her time with little darlin
POD1000000019_S0000244	the album is called sock soul i am guessing in reference to the line in harper valley pta about how missus johnson socked it to him
POD1000000019_S0000245	but this stuff was all recorded before anyone thought of genie c reilly as the loudest voice calling bs on american society so none of the songs bit that album title or her image
POD1000000019_S0000246	the material is good it is just in the same vein being mined by every other female voice in country music
POD1000000019_S0000248	the price i pay to stay barely cracked the country top 40 from there her singles were hit or miss if you judge them by commercial results
POD1000000019_S0000249	but even when she released a legitimate hit nobody saw it that way because it was not another harper valley pta
POD1000000019_S0000251	her 1st proper single released after that little darlin compilation of basically demo recordings was there never was a time
POD1000000019_S0000252	here is her doing it on the johnny cash show
POD1000000019_S0000254	that song was a top 5 country hit that also cracked the pop hot 100 now listen to how great this other single is from the same album as that song the backside of dallas was not a hit but it is a damn good song
POD1000000019_S0000256	up until the mid 70s the quality of her music remained pretty consistent here is her next top 10 country girl
POD1000000019_S0000258	she was starting to branch away from the harper valley pta prototype of getting on a microphone and pointing fingers at
POD1000000019_S0000259	also letting jeannie multitrack her own harmony vocals was a great way to shut up the critics who liked to say she had no range as a singer
POD1000000019_S0000260	and of course most of these critics were pop writers who were only aware of genie c reilly because of the pop success of harbor valley pta and whose only other frame of reference for country music in the 60s and 70s was probably johnny cash
POD1000000019_S0000261	like the la times pop critic robert hilburn who reviewed a genie c reilly concert in 1971 under the headline little talent
POD1000000019_S0000262	quote genie c reilly has all the confidence in the world but unfortunately very little of the talent
POD1000000019_S0000263	1st of all her voice is not any good 2nd neither is her material that is 2 strikes against her and as soon as the public forgets harper valley pta that is 3 strikes and she is out
POD1000000019_S0000264	now maybe that guy was having a bad day or something but he does not know what the hell he is talking about he is wrong on every single point from everything i have seen genie c reilly was even better live than on recording
POD1000000019_S0000266	check out this performance of a song you heard just a little bit ago backside of dallas
POD1000000019_S0000268	she always had a crack band behind her the harper valley express they usually made the tempo of everything faster to really put some gas in the tank and it is impossible to deny jeannie is charisma as a performer
POD1000000019_S0000270	the song she is singing is about a woman becoming a prostitute and her expressions alternate between sassy and serious in a way that keeps shifting the meaning of the lyrics
POD1000000019_S0000272	those charm school classes paid off she knew how to work a crowd striking poses and flashing 20 different kinds of smile in all the right places
POD1000000019_S0000273	but that la times review of her concert is the sort of dismissive attitude the pop intelligentsia had towards southern culture
POD1000000019_S0000274	not only was jeannie not a one hit wonder she made good albums with very little filler check out this album track from 1972 never even released as a single called without you
POD1000000019_S0000276	her voice is on the melody is there what more could you want from a country love song this is the kind of track you hope is waiting to surprise you when you buy someone is album based on one or 2 of the singles
POD1000000019_S0000277	without you is brumgini is 2nd album on mgm after leaving plantation records in 1972 in what shelby singleton called a breach of contract
POD1000000019_S0000278	jeannie is lock in the courtroom held winning this case as well though she maintained for the rest of her career that she was never paid what she believed she was owed for harper valley pta is earnings
POD1000000019_S0000280	her full commitment to christianity seems to have taken place sometime in the 70s
POD1000000019_S0000281	and seems to have caused at least some regret for her previous persona as country music is most blatant sex symbol to date the clothing changed the music took a turn to gospel and
POD1000000019_S0000282	this is purely speculation on my part but it looks to me like money could have really become a problem for her in the early 1980s
POD1000000019_S0000283	that autobiography of hers was published in the year 1981 shortly before the release of a gospel album with the same title as the book
POD1000000019_S0000284	generally speaking when a musical artist quote unquote passed their prime puts out an album right after they put out a book
POD1000000019_S0000285	it is safe to assume that book is meant to generate new interest in that artist is music in advance of the new album
POD1000000019_S0000287	in other words it is often a promotional strategy if that is what happened here then the only problem is this book was printed by a small publisher of christian books
POD1000000019_S0000289	it may not be safe to assume that no major publishers were interested and that is why genie went with the small christian publisher
POD1000000019_S0000290	however it does seem very safe to assume that this small christian publishing house would mostly if not exclusively have a promotional network meant to get their product in front of conservative christians
POD1000000019_S0000291	aka the exact opposite audience of the only reason anyone knows genie c reilly is name harper valley pta a song highly critical of hypocrisy in social groups with hardcore conservative values
POD1000000019_S0000293	even the music fans who did find the book would not be likely to recommend it to a friend because of how poorly it is written and how most of it is irrelevant to her career in music
POD1000000019_S0000295	people who bought the book because they happened to see it on one of their regular trips to the christian bookstore would no doubt be scandalized by jeannie is rampant infidelity and the pot smoking
POD1000000019_S0000297	the used copy that i have once belonged to a library in new mexico it still has the stamp card in the back i can see here that only 4 people checked it out in 1981
POD1000000019_S0000298	the year it was published one person in 1982 nobody in 1983 and one or 2 readers a year at best from there it was discarded in 1995
POD1000000019_S0000299	having been checked out a grand total of 13 times not good especially if that was the main plan to get people hyped for that new gospel album
POD1000000019_S0000300	which entirely failed to chart if she had hopes of getting off the road where she seems to have been making most of her income from harper valley to the mountaintop as a book album combo did not deliver
POD1000000019_S0000301	next move ask tom t hall to write another harper valley pta a thing he had been very vocal about his reluctance to do but also he is a big softie
POD1000000019_S0000302	it is easy to imagine him having a hard time saying no when jeannie came to him about it in 1984 tom wrote he even made all the lyrics fit jeannie is new christian lifestyle
POD1000000019_S0000304	we are back at harper valley high because our narrator is grandchildren go to the school now and she is bought a ticket to the raffle at a school dance she is wearing a dress that is well below her knees
POD1000000019_S0000305	because just about every character from the original song is now on the straight and narrow
POD1000000019_S0000307	but would not you know it she spots a man giving a cigarette to a school kid and it turns out he is selling drugs in the parking lot there is the drummer of the band doing cocaine and these kids are all getting drunk and taking pills and taking off their clothes
POD1000000019_S0000308	she thinks about going home for her gun but instead decides to go home pray with her bible and you guessed it bring all this up at the next meeting of the harper valley pta
POD1000000019_S0000309	in short the song is terrible nobody cared at all
POD1000000019_S0000310	even with tom joining genie for promo appearances on all the usual tv shows like nashville now
POD1000000019_S0000313	as you heard there seems to have been a sense of urgency in the writing recording and release of this song whatever the reason for the rush and even if fans of the original song had grown to develop more conservative values
POD1000000019_S0000314	there simply was not enough interest in this return to generate airplay or sales figures
POD1000000019_S0000316	7 years later in 1991 jeannie put out what looks like will be her final formally released single here is to the cowboys
POD1000000019_S0000318	the entire review in billboard is one sentence riley gives a poignant reading of this tribute to cowboys who are committed enough to be domesticated
POD1000000019_S0000320	as some of you may have seen on fox news in 2002 somewhere along the line she apparently forgot that she worked with the guy who was probably responsible for creating the elvis is still alive rumors

POD1000000019_S0000329	i love tom t hall based on how many people requested a tom t hall episode as soon as i went public with this show it is safe to say a lot of you do too
POD1000000019_S0000330	of course i had the whole 1st season written before i released an episode but i have got to say i was pretty surprised that tom t was such an instant demand from everyone i thought i was just making an episode about one of my favorite songwriters
POD1000000019_S0000331	so i am excited for all you other tom t hall fans out there to get your ears on this one
POD1000000019_S0000332	i do not think i should put an ad in this episode for obvious reasons so what i am going to do is tell you about the other podcast i am doing
POD1000000019_S0000333	the other podcast is called your favorite band sucks it is exactly what it sounds like it is you know it is a comedy podcast it is more like other podcasts than this one
POD1000000019_S0000334	cocaine and rhinestones is very scripted very produced it takes me a long time to make these episodes your favorite band sucks is the exact opposite it is just my friend mark and i sit down and say some of the worst things you will ever hear about bands that you probably love
POD1000000019_S0000335	it should be available in itunes and everywhere by now or you can go listen to it at yfbspod com
POD1000000019_S0000336	our 1st 3 episodes are out now we did an episode on the beatles an episode on the rolling stones
POD1000000019_S0000337	and an episode on christmas music
POD1000000019_S0000338	yeah enjoy
POD1000000019_S0000339	alright here are the liner notes for genie c reilly
POD1000000019_S0000340	i had no idea what i was in for when i began this episode and i will tell you right now that i have no idea what the truth is here
POD1000000019_S0000341	just wow
POD1000000019_S0000342	i do not even know what i am really allowed to say right now but i guess if i am going to get in trouble for this then i probably already crossed that line so .
POD1000000019_S0000343	i know there are lies in this episode because i told you which ones i found out about but i have no idea what else is or is not a lie
POD1000000019_S0000344	all i can tell you is that i did not knowingly perpetuate a lie when i am reading a book i pretty much always save the preface and foreword stuff until after i have read the book
POD1000000019_S0000345	because there have been a few times reading some classic novel or something where the person writing the foreword some scholar or someone assumes everyone must have already read this book before
POD1000000019_S0000346	and they drop major spoilers right there before you have even read the 1st page so out of habit i just never read that stuff in the beginning of a book if the book is good i will usually go back and read it or if i am just like what the hell did i just read then i will go back and read it
POD1000000019_S0000347	and that 2nd scenario was very much the case with genie c reilly is book by the 2nd page of the book when she was putting those words in shelby singleton is mouth and it just did not seem like the way he talked to me
POD1000000019_S0000348	and it did not make sense the way that she was having him act based on other information she was giving you at the same time i had a feeling something was up
POD1000000019_S0000349	then a little bit later she is writing about having just married mickey while she is still in high school i will just read it to you out of the book this is a quote
POD1000000019_S0000350	mickey and i moved into a small apartment and struggled each month to make it on his salary we postponed going to nashville until i graduated from high school and we could save some money
POD1000000019_S0000351	i was at the doctor is office for a checkup when he told me he thought i was pregnant in another month we will know for sure he said okay and the quote
POD1000000019_S0000352	i did not skip over anything there at all she writes a sentence about waiting to move to nashville until she graduates high school then the very next sentence is about her finding out she is pregnant
POD1000000019_S0000353	there is a 4 year gap between those 2 sentences i still have no idea why that gap is there but that is when i knew i was reading some bullshit
POD1000000019_S0000354	so after finishing the book i went back to read the stuff at the beginning and i found that disclaimer about the facts being altered
POD1000000019_S0000355	and that disclaimer is written by jeannie is co author who i also failed to mention is a preacher here is what he writes quote
POD1000000019_S0000356	in one instance we also changed the details slightly to purposefully disguise a scene
POD1000000019_S0000357	only those who were involved will recognize what we have done but all the rest is true just as it happened when god picked up the harper valley girl and set her on a mountaintop
POD1000000019_S0000358	okay even that disclaimer is so entirely bizarre the whole thing makes me wonder if this guy is even talking about inventing the character of phil blackmon
POD1000000019_S0000359	1st of all they changed the names to protect people jeannie loves jeannie loves the person who blackmailed her with revenge porn okay next in one instance we have changed the details slightly to disguise a scene
POD1000000019_S0000360	that is not at all an accurate description of phil blackman is existence in this book there are many scenes that had a lot more than slight details changed
POD1000000019_S0000361	several that had to have been completely fabricated anywhere in the book she talks about the 1st black rose single is a lie talking about meeting aubrey mayhew in las vegas
POD1000000019_S0000362	is a lie talking about getting out of a contract with phil blackmon to record with aubrey mayhew
POD1000000019_S0000363	is a lie it would take me 10 minutes to list everything that is for sure a lie and it would probably take me half an hour to list everything i suspect is a lie in this book
POD1000000019_S0000364	then still with this disclaimer the part at the end where he writes quote but all the rest is true end quote he was not there when all of this stuff happened so all that means is this is what she told me happened
POD1000000019_S0000365	and that really makes me wonder if jeannie came up with this whole phil blackmon storyline on her own and tried to sell it to this guy as fact
POD1000000019_S0000366	maybe he figured out she was lying so this disclaimer is his way of covering his own ass in case i do not know aubrey mayhew decided to sue the shit out of him
POD1000000019_S0000367	this is all obviously wild speculation on my part but at this point i am not sure what other response i could possibly have to this pile of nonsense the attempt at disguising the truth is so clumsy that it even presents another possibility
POD1000000019_S0000368	which is that they wanted people to figure out the truth and have it blow up into this big controversy to sell the book that certainly sounds like a business strategy someone might pick up from say working with shelby singleton
POD1000000019_S0000369	the only problem being that hardly anyone read this stupid book in the 1st place so that did not happen there is so much other stuff in that autobiography that i did not even get into
POD1000000019_S0000370	definitely do buy this book if you want to see a worst case example of a country singer autobiography
POD1000000019_S0000371	i had not yet been broken down enough by making this podcast to just start writing in the books i read or else whoever ends up with my copy of this one could have looked forward to some pretty intense scribbles all over it i am sure
POD1000000019_S0000372	0 yeah by the way i am giving away the books that i read to make season one of this podcast cocaineandrhinestones com slash giveaway for details on that you could end up with my copy of this book with a library card in the back and everything
POD1000000019_S0000373	a real piece of podcast history okay all of this deception aside i think we are starting to get an idea of how differently all the people involved can come out the other side of a hit song
POD1000000019_S0000374	one thing that is really interesting that we heard today is unlike as you heard in the 2nd episode of the podcast loretta lynn is recording of the pill
POD1000000019_S0000375	the music establishment in nashville and everywhere else mostly just got on board with this song right away tex ritter did say that the song sounded dirty and suggestive and some radio stations did ban it but who cares
POD1000000019_S0000376	i let you hear it from industry giants you heard johnny cash say it won a grammy award you heard roger miller announce it as the cma single of the year
POD1000000019_S0000377	sure the lyrics are not scandalous at all compared to the pill but why do you think these 2 songs were received so differently by the old guard i know what i think
POD1000000019_S0000378	i think money talks i think that by the time any of those would be buzzkills started paying attention this song was already the number one pop song in america and it went number one pop before it went number one country
POD1000000019_S0000379	every major record label in nashville had been falling all over itself for 15 years trying to do that they would have made genie c reilly the mayor of nashville if she did it a 2nd time
POD1000000019_S0000380	her 2nd single did not get there but they let her hang around a while to see if it happened again it did not and this is the story we end up with
POD1000000019_S0000381	by the way i could also get into a whole other ramble about nature vs nurture here you know is genie c reilly quote unquote the way that she is now
POD1000000019_S0000382	because of everything that happened to her or was she always like that i honestly do not know after recording this episode i was checking one more thing and i found a people magazine interview from 1981
POD1000000019_S0000383	that says genie was broke by the mid 70s so i was a little late on my guess when i said it looked like money problems were there in the early 80s but i was right
POD1000000019_S0000384	they were there if anyone cares jeannie and mickey did remarry after a super long who gives a shit will they will not they phase in that same people magazine article i just mentioned he is quoted as saying
POD1000000019_S0000385	also after recording this episode i found out that jeannie c riley misquoted the la times critic robert hilburn in her book
POD1000000019_S0000386	because of course she did also the review was from 1969 so it makes so much more sense knowing that it came from that time
POD1000000019_S0000387	than 2 years later in 1971 as jeanne stated in the book this is really aggravating for me to have to talk about right now because this is just my fault
POD1000000019_S0000388	this is my fault for not fact checking every minor detail of what i was using from a source that i knew was bad here is what robert actually wrote in his review
POD1000000019_S0000389	quote miss riley has all the confidence in the world on stage but unfortunately little of the talent
POD1000000019_S0000390	neither her voice nor most of her material largely drawn from her 2 albums is very good that is 2 strikes
POD1000000019_S0000391	the day the public forgets harper valley pta may mean 3 the difference between what is written there and what i quoted in the episode may seem so small as to not be noticeable by some of you but it is there and i do see it
POD1000000019_S0000392	my response in the episode to genie is version of this review is harsher than what it would have been if i was reacting to the real review
POD1000000019_S0000393	so if robert hilburn happens to be listening to this i do apologize to you sir we may still disagree about something you wrote nearly 40 years ago
POD1000000019_S0000394	but not nearly as strongly as i thought when reading and reacting to it secondhand okay there are no more books to talk about as sources for this one
POD1000000019_S0000395	lots of good video clips on cocaineandrinestones com so make sure to go watch those to get the full picture of some things i talked about come back next week we are putting this baby to bed it is the end of the harbor valley pta series
POD1000000019_S0000396	we are talking tom t hall on cocaine and rhinestones
POD1000000021_S0000001	is it true that he is kind of a private and quiet like introverted person when he is by himself
POD1000000021_S0000002	are you asking me or him
POD1000000021_S0000004	asking him if you want to weigh in too that is fine
POD1000000021_S0000005	he definitely is
POD1000000021_S0000006	that is trina edwards we were talking about her husband edwin edwards the former governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000007	trina is almost 42 and edwin will be 93 in august
POD1000000021_S0000008	she was passing along my questions because he has a hard time hearing over the phone
POD1000000021_S0000009	is it true that you are a quiet kind of introverted person when you are not in public when you are home by yourself
POD1000000021_S0000010	well i am a very different person when i am not on the stage
POD1000000021_S0000011	that is the way i am i am very quiet and private and i do not drink at all
POD1000000021_S0000012	i do not use drugs at all and so now the most fun i have in life is taking care of my 7 year old child
POD1000000021_S0000013	and my wife
POD1000000021_S0000014	okay
POD1000000021_S0000015	trina is edwin is 3rd wife
POD1000000021_S0000016	they have been married since 2011
POD1000000021_S0000017	the 2 of them met when she started writing him letters in federal prison
POD1000000021_S0000018	edward served 8 years on corruption charges
POD1000000021_S0000019	he was convicted of rigging casino licenses during his final term as governor
POD1000000021_S0000020	when he got out he and trina brought their relationship to reality tv
POD1000000021_S0000022	their show went off the air after 8 episodes
POD1000000021_S0000023	since then edwards has run for congress and lost and he is had a couple of health scares
POD1000000021_S0000024	but he still has a remarkable command of louisiana political history much of which he shaped during his 4 terms as governor
POD1000000021_S0000025	to understand david duke you need to understand what makes louisiana politics distinctive
POD1000000021_S0000026	the unique alliances the entrenched corruption and the charismatic figures who have molded the state in their own images
POD1000000021_S0000027	and edwin edwards is louisiana politics personified
POD1000000021_S0000028	edwards is 1st gubernatorial campaign began in 1971
POD1000000021_S0000029	1st of all i spoke french and in 1971 there were still people older people in louisiana who understood english but they preferred to hear and speak in french
POD1000000021_S0000030	so i made some franchise and it helped me with that particular group of people
POD1000000021_S0000031	i mean he had a coalition a distinctly louisiana coalition he had cajuns and blacks
POD1000000021_S0000032	that is marc morial he worked with edwards as a state legislator and as the mayor of new orleans
POD1000000021_S0000033	in louisiana if you can put those 2 voting bases together in those days it was an unbeatable coalition
POD1000000021_S0000034	unlike most of his white democratic peers edwards was an unabashed civil rights champion
POD1000000021_S0000035	he invited black louisianans to work in government positions and helped craft a state constitution that outlawed discrimination
POD1000000021_S0000036	he also made louisiana richer
POD1000000021_S0000037	as governor edwards helped change how crude oil got taxed
POD1000000021_S0000038	moving from a flat fee per barrel to a percentage of the barrel price when oil prices shot up state revenues soared
POD1000000021_S0000039	so did edwin edwards is popularity
POD1000000021_S0000040	stories about edwards gambling and womanizing did not hurt him with voters
POD1000000021_S0000041	the miasma of corruption and scandal that hung over his administration did not damage him either
POD1000000021_S0000042	there were 6 grand jury investigations during edwards 1st term
POD1000000021_S0000043	but he was not indicted in any of those cases
POD1000000021_S0000044	it seemed like the silver haired silver tongued governor could talk his way out of anything
POD1000000021_S0000045	when asked about some iffy political donations edwards said it was illegal for them to give but not for me to receive
POD1000000021_S0000046	edwards led louisiana for 8 years leaving office in march 1980
POD1000000021_S0000047	the only thing stopping him from being governor for life were term limits that edwards himself had pushed for
POD1000000021_S0000048	so he went on a brief hiatus sitting out the next election cycle then returning in 1983 to reclaim his throne
POD1000000021_S0000049	in the last days of that campaign edwards fired off his most famous one liner
POD1000000021_S0000050	the only way i can lose this election is if i got caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy
POD1000000021_S0000051	and that took on a life of its own and has been quoted many times since by other people
POD1000000021_S0000052	is that good enough
POD1000000021_S0000053	yeah thank you trina does he regret saying that or is he happy that he said it
POD1000000021_S0000055	i guarantee he does not regret anything he is ever done hold on
POD1000000021_S0000056	do you regret saying that or are you happy you said that
POD1000000021_S0000057	no it is one of the things that i said that people identified with me and they thought it was kind of funny
POD1000000021_S0000058	edwards was right to believe that 1983 election was a lock he would win it with 62% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000059	to celebrate his victory he did something audacious even by edwin edwards standards
POD1000000021_S0000061	if there is one thing louisiana governor elect edwin edwards knows it is how to have a good time even with a $40 campaign deficit staring him down
POD1000000021_S0000062	edwards chartered 2 jumbo jets announced he was going to paris and invited anyone willing to contribute $10000 to come on along
POD1000000021_S0000063	more than 600 people joined edwards on that trip to france which was touted as the largest single political fundraiser ever thrown by an american politician
POD1000000021_S0000064	the writer roy blunt junior on assignment for people magazine went along for the ride
POD1000000021_S0000065	you know the whole deal did not smell of righteousness
POD1000000021_S0000066	that is for sure but as some people said it is hard to be proper and have a real good time
POD1000000021_S0000067	the french speaking edwards and his crew of louisianans ate high class cuisine at the palace of versailles
POD1000000021_S0000068	the governor also received a warm greeting from a nun outside notre dame cathedral
POD1000000021_S0000069	and she gave him what she described as a french kiss which was actually of course more like a nun is kiss
POD1000000021_S0000070	but she could take a joke and so he said okay sister but just do not let me get into the habit
POD1000000021_S0000071	and all of his supporters gathered around cheered and beamed
POD1000000021_S0000072	and that is the kind of thing they had come to paris for
POD1000000021_S0000073	the party ended for edwin edwards as soon as those jumbo jets landed back in louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000074	the campaign of 83 was great it was one of the funnest experiences of my life
POD1000000021_S0000075	the service in the governor is office from 84 to 87 it was not
POD1000000021_S0000076	it was a very difficult experience
POD1000000021_S0000077	that is sid moreland he was edwin edwards assistant
POD1000000021_S0000078	by the mid 1980s oil and gas revenues had plummeted and the state was facing a huge deficit
POD1000000021_S0000079	edwards tried to fill that hole with tax increases
POD1000000021_S0000080	his constituents did not find that rakish or charming
POD1000000021_S0000081	you know when you are trying to raise taxes on people who are really struggling already it is a very precarious political situation to be in
POD1000000021_S0000082	so this tax package was probably the beginning of his unpopularity
POD1000000021_S0000083	in february 1985 edwin edwards is run of bad luck
POD1000000021_S0000084	got a whole lot worse
POD1000000021_S0000085	the 50 count federal indictment charges governor edwards and 6 others including his brother and a nephew
POD1000000021_S0000086	with racketeering and fraud in a multi $10 scheme involving the effective sale of state approval for medical facility construction projects
POD1000000021_S0000087	edwards was accused basically of accepting bribes to steer state money to his friends
POD1000000021_S0000088	the trial dragged on somehow for 14 weeks
POD1000000021_S0000089	moreland spent most of it on a payphone outside the new orleans courtroom
POD1000000021_S0000090	i was constantly calling the governor is office in baton rouge and getting the phone messages
POD1000000021_S0000091	and returning those phone calls and explaining to people under the circumstances you know the governor can not talk to you right this minute
POD1000000021_S0000092	and we tried to be as diplomatic about it as we could
POD1000000021_S0000093	and of course most people knew where he was and what he was going through but they called anyway
POD1000000021_S0000094	the case ended in a mistrial edwards was later retried and found not guilty
POD1000000021_S0000095	when that verdict came in the prosecutor said if we did not make him honest i hope we made him sorry
POD1000000021_S0000096	when i asked edwards about the case he did not sound all that sorry
POD1000000021_S0000097	that was an example of a stupid prosecutor who did not know anything about what was happening
POD1000000021_S0000098	did it bother him when people said he was profiting from his role as the governor
POD1000000021_S0000099	did it bother you when people said you were profiting from your role as governor
POD1000000021_S0000100	no because .
POD1000000021_S0000102	there is no truth to it so it did not bother me at all i just laughed about it
POD1000000021_S0000103	edwards may have been laughing but he was still in a precarious spot
POD1000000021_S0000104	in good times most people in louisiana loved his misadventures
POD1000000021_S0000105	but these were not good times the boom years of the 1970s were long gone
POD1000000021_S0000106	in 1987 louisiana was ready for a change
POD1000000021_S0000107	i notice my opponents do not make many people angry
POD1000000021_S0000108	that does not surprise you does it politics as usual
POD1000000021_S0000109	i do not like louisiana politics i love louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000110	i love louisiana enough to make some people angry
POD1000000021_S0000111	buddy romer was a congressman from north louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000112	in the last 4 weeks of the 1987 governor is race he is zoomed from 5th to 1st in the polls buoyed by folksy tv ads and a string of newspaper endorsements
POD1000000021_S0000113	romer led edwards by 5 percentage points after the 1st round of voting
POD1000000021_S0000114	setting the stage for a runoff but when edwards emerged after one a m to greet his supporters he made a move that nobody had anticipated
POD1000000021_S0000115	and i have determined that under the circumstances since i did not run 1st
POD1000000021_S0000116	that it would be inappropriate for me to continue this election
POD1000000021_S0000117	supporters were stunned some of his family cried
POD1000000021_S0000119	he is 60 he has been governor 12 years
POD1000000021_S0000120	he said that is long enough most voters thought so too
POD1000000021_S0000121	there would be no runoff romer would be the next governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000122	and edwin edwards it looked to outside observers like his career was finished
POD1000000021_S0000123	but that is not how edward saw it dropping out of the race that was the 1st step in his comeback plan
POD1000000021_S0000124	i spoke with him that night and he was absolutely resolute that 0 look i am going to let him have it
POD1000000021_S0000125	i am going to turn it over to him he has been going all over this state saying he is going to fix this he is going to fix that
POD1000000021_S0000126	and he is going to disintegrate you mark my word
POD1000000021_S0000128	edwards had it all mapped out he would let romer run the state for a few difficult years then re emerge to save the day
POD1000000021_S0000129	it would not be that simple the 1991 election would be about a lot more than who got to sleep in the governor is mansion
POD1000000021_S0000130	it would be a fight over what louisiana was and what it should be
POD1000000021_S0000131	and edwin edwards and buddy romer would not be the only ones in that battle
POD1000000021_S0000133	in 1991 david duke was at the height of his powers
POD1000000021_S0000134	he toned his message built a rabid fan base and comes shockingly close to getting elected to the u s senate
POD1000000021_S0000135	the governor is race would be the culmination of his life is work
POD1000000021_S0000136	this was duke is chance to turn his words into actions to take control of an entire state and make it into whatever he wanted

POD1000000021_S0000152	when edwin edwards was 3 years old the governor of louisiana had a man kidnapped
POD1000000021_S0000153	it was 1930 and the governor was huey long
POD1000000021_S0000154	the guy who got snatched was about to expose rampant graft in state government
POD1000000021_S0000155	4 days after he disappeared the victim reemerged to say not at all credibly that he would staged the kidnapping himself
POD1000000021_S0000156	in a radio broadcast the man announced that governor huey long was his best friend in the world
POD1000000021_S0000157	long was shot and killed at the state capitol 5 years later
POD1000000021_S0000158	a lot of people in louisiana will tell you that he was the best friend the state ever had
POD1000000021_S0000159	yes long was a corrupt dictator and sure he orchestrated a kidnapping
POD1000000021_S0000160	but he also built bridges and hospitals and paid for it all with money he would pried free from the big oil companies
POD1000000021_S0000161	edwin edwards carried on huey long is tradition of economic populism
POD1000000021_S0000162	like long edwards used money snatched from big oil to build bridges and hospitals
POD1000000021_S0000163	all that and he finished construction of the louisiana superdome
POD1000000021_S0000164	david duke on the other hand said he would not follow long is example
POD1000000021_S0000165	we need another populist not a populist like huey long for more government but a populist for the state of louisiana for less government and more power to the people thank you very much
POD1000000021_S0000167	in reality duke is brand of populism had nothing to do with shrinking government
POD1000000021_S0000168	it was built on racial resentment
POD1000000021_S0000169	duke is message the journalist john mcginnis wrote held a lot of appeal for the children and grandchildren of huey long is old voters
POD1000000021_S0000170	i doubt that duke cared one way or the other about long is policies but he did respect the man is power and fame and referenced it to make a point about his own celebrity
POD1000000021_S0000171	the ladies that do the tours of the state capitol not far from here they always tell me they say you know there is 2 things people want to see when they come to the state capitol in baton rouge
POD1000000021_S0000172	they want to see where huey long was shot and where david duke sits
POD1000000021_S0000174	buddy romer offered voters a 3rd option a complete break from the sleaze and self dealing that had marred louisiana politics from the long era to the present day
POD1000000021_S0000175	the harvard educated roamer said that long is legacy was something for nothing
POD1000000021_S0000176	somebody else pays
POD1000000021_S0000177	romer promised a new era of responsibility one that would earn his home state national respect
POD1000000021_S0000178	he called this the romer revolution
POD1000000021_S0000179	most people in america will never come to louisiana most people in america will know us only by our reputation
POD1000000021_S0000180	i will put louisiana 1st and we will make them stop laughing and start listening
POD1000000021_S0000181	romer is big initiative was a plan to modernize the state is approach to taxation
POD1000000021_S0000182	one day early and with votes to spare tax reform finally made it through the louisiana legislature
POD1000000021_S0000183	we are talking a new way of approaching our old problems that are eating us alive
POD1000000021_S0000184	romer was adamant that his fiscal reform plan was not a tax increase
POD1000000021_S0000185	he said it would just shift more of the burden to people with higher incomes
POD1000000021_S0000186	in the spring of 1989 he made that pitch to louisiana is voters who needed to approve the proposal in a statewide referendum
POD1000000021_S0000187	david duke then a newly elected state legislator was one of the governor is most outspoken critics
POD1000000021_S0000188	overall it is a $6250 tax increase and this from a governor who swore to us he would not raise taxes
POD1000000021_S0000189	i am going to ignore david duke
POD1000000021_S0000190	i mean i do not care what the american nazi party thinks about this problem
POD1000000021_S0000191	a lot of people in louisiana did care what david duke had to say
POD1000000021_S0000192	duke staged a series of rallies across the state railing against romer and presenting himself as the champion of the working class
POD1000000021_S0000193	at one event a louisiana anti tax tea party he climbed aboard a riverboat and tossed some tea into the mississippi river
POD1000000021_S0000194	you do not raise taxes in a recession duke said
POD1000000021_S0000195	you do not tax your way into prosperity
POD1000000021_S0000196	the blues on the streets of new orleans are now being sung in the governor is mansion after voters resoundingly rejected new taxes
POD1000000021_S0000197	digging louisiana is already troubled economy ever deeper in debt and forcing reform minded governor buddy romer to scramble his way out of a new financial crisis
POD1000000021_S0000198	as of may 1989 the roma revolution was pretty much dead
POD1000000021_S0000199	later that year romer is wife patty left him when the political consultant raymond strother visited romer in early 1991
POD1000000021_S0000200	the governor was still in a deep funk
POD1000000021_S0000201	he said i am glad to see you i need your help
POD1000000021_S0000202	he said i need to write a letter to patty
POD1000000021_S0000203	i know i have made some mistakes but he said i want her to come home and he said help me write this letter you are a good writer
POD1000000021_S0000204	strother said that he was not the man for that job
POD1000000021_S0000205	his own wife had just left him a few weeks earlier
POD1000000021_S0000206	but strother who would helped romer win in 1987 was available to work on the governor is re election campaign
POD1000000021_S0000208	he said move into the mansion and i did
POD1000000021_S0000209	and it was nice you know you have a dry cleaner downstairs and you put your shoes outside the door every night and they come they start the next day shine
POD1000000021_S0000210	and every night when i would go to my room there would be a picture of milk and ice and some still warm cookies
POD1000000021_S0000211	how good were the cookies
POD1000000021_S0000212	the cookies were splendid
POD1000000021_S0000213	they were baked every afternoon and sometimes again just before breakfast
POD1000000021_S0000214	so i always had fresh cooks that could probably gain £10 i was already fat so
POD1000000021_S0000215	apart from the cookies strother has no fond memories of working on romer is re election
POD1000000021_S0000216	the 1st big conflict came when a new ag romer advisor named danny walker suggested that the governor wear a rubber band around his wrist
POD1000000021_S0000217	and he said well every time you have a bad thought if you will pop that rubber band and cause a little pain pretty soon you will not be having bad thoughts
POD1000000021_S0000218	i said you keep your damn rubber bands yourself danny
POD1000000021_S0000219	romer actually liked the rubber band idea
POD1000000021_S0000220	the governor also embraced robert fulgham is book
POD1000000021_S0000221	all i really need to know i learned in kindergarten which touted the virtues of sharing everything and playing fair
POD1000000021_S0000222	buddy was into that guru sort of stuff touchy feely
POD1000000021_S0000223	i can not stand that kind of thing
POD1000000021_S0000224	after reading that self help guide the governor decided he had been too abrasive
POD1000000021_S0000225	in his state of the state address romer apologized to the legislature for his inflexibility and insensitivity
POD1000000021_S0000226	let us say goodbye to me and hello to we
POD1000000021_S0000227	let us say goodbye to lions in the sand
POD1000000021_S0000228	for strother the self help stuff was bad but what happened next was worse
POD1000000021_S0000230	one day at the mansion he happened upon a meeting that he was not supposed to know about
POD1000000021_S0000231	i saw mary matlin a whole bunch of high echelon republicans sitting around the table the dining room table with buddy
POD1000000021_S0000232	and i said 0 my god
POD1000000021_S0000233	romer had always been conservative
POD1000000021_S0000234	as a congressman he tended to vote with republican president ronald reagan and against his own democratic party
POD1000000021_S0000235	but struther says romer had always assured him he would not move to the gop
POD1000000021_S0000236	he broke that promise in march 1991
POD1000000021_S0000237	romer explained himself at a press conference outside the white house where president george h w bush had just welcomed him into the republican fold
POD1000000021_S0000238	i would say that party is not the most important thing in america families are integrity ideals commitment principles
POD1000000021_S0000239	those are more important and on those issues i never change
POD1000000021_S0000240	but when it comes to political action i will be a republican and proudly work in the party
POD1000000021_S0000241	romer was the 1st sitting governor in modern american history to switch parties
POD1000000021_S0000242	ideology aside romer thought the move was smart strategy
POD1000000021_S0000243	edwin edwards was going to grab votes from his left no matter what
POD1000000021_S0000244	romer figured that branding himself a republican would help stave off right wing challengers who might threaten his re election
POD1000000021_S0000245	the statewide poll showed that the top 3 candidates are duke edwards and myself
POD1000000021_S0000246	and in the last poll i was in the 40s edwards in the 30s
POD1000000021_S0000247	and duke 10 11 or 12 with some undecided i felt good about the politics
POD1000000021_S0000248	raymond strother did not feel good about the politics
POD1000000021_S0000249	it was a dumb move for him and me it was just a dumb move
POD1000000021_S0000250	democrats in louisiana felt burned by romer and republicans including state party officials were not sure they could trust him either
POD1000000021_S0000251	billy nungesser the republican chair who would undercut the effort to censure david duke
POD1000000021_S0000252	resented that romer had not included him in discussions about the party switch and romer forgetting the lessons of all i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten cursed out nungesser rather than trying to appease him
POD1000000021_S0000253	the louisiana republicans made their endorsement in the governor is race at a state convention in june 1991
POD1000000021_S0000254	that endorsement would not go to buddy romer or david duke
POD1000000021_S0000255	the gop is choice was a pro life congressman named clyde holloway the preferred candidate of the christian coalition
POD1000000021_S0000256	romer knowing that he would not get endorsed did not bother to show up at the convention
POD1000000021_S0000257	but duke and his supporters made their presence known
POD1000000021_S0000258	here is how the anti duke activist beth rickey described the scene in 1991
POD1000000021_S0000259	it was like a duke convention they were just booing indiscriminately anything and everybody and they were just wild and they were
POD1000000021_S0000260	then duke was egging them on you know to disrupt things
POD1000000021_S0000261	they had to sing dixie to quiet them down quite literally they tried god bless america
POD1000000021_S0000262	and the battle hymn of the republic but it was not until they sang i wish i were in the land of cotton that the hush fell over the convention
POD1000000021_S0000263	buddy romer had tried to consolidate the conservative vote
POD1000000021_S0000264	that plan had been a total failure
POD1000000021_S0000265	the splintering of the louisiana republican party would be a gift to edwin edwards and to david duke

POD1000000021_S0000284	no other state does elections like louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000285	the credit for that or the blame belongs to edwin edwards
POD1000000021_S0000286	the 1st time he ran for governor edwards had to compete in 3 separate races
POD1000000021_S0000287	a closed democratic primary a democratic runoff and then the general election
POD1000000021_S0000288	in the days when democrats dominated louisiana that last race against a republican also ran was a pointless nuisance
POD1000000021_S0000289	it was like winning the 100 meter dash at the olympics then having to out sprint a kid pulled from the stands to get your gold medal
POD1000000021_S0000290	and i did not like that idea i said well look let us change it
POD1000000021_S0000291	everybody qualifies at the same time regardless of affiliation
POD1000000021_S0000292	and everybody votes for anybody he or she wishes regardless of registration
POD1000000021_S0000293	louisiana is open primary system went into effect in 1975
POD1000000021_S0000294	edwards cruised to re election that year as the republican party did not even field a candidate
POD1000000021_S0000295	but in the reagan years the gop surged throughout the south
POD1000000021_S0000296	by 1991 the open primary was open in a way edwards maybe had not anticipated
POD1000000021_S0000297	it was a true 2 party free for all
POD1000000021_S0000298	political writer john mcginnis had a name for the showdown between david duke edwin edwards and buddy roemer
POD1000000021_S0000299	i call this the race from hell
POD1000000021_S0000300	you have 3 very angry men candidates for governor and the people are not too happy either
POD1000000021_S0000301	in the beginning the race from hell was not exactly rollicking
POD1000000021_S0000302	one reason for that was a package of campaign finance reforms part of buddy roemer is good government agenda
POD1000000021_S0000303	the new law limited individual contributions to $5000 in major statewide races
POD1000000021_S0000304	banned cash contributions of more than $100 and required that small cash donations be reported
POD1000000021_S0000305	duke could pass the bucket with impunity during his 1990 senate campaign because that was a federal race
POD1000000021_S0000306	but thanks to romer the revolutionary louisiana is guidelines on cash giving were now stricter than the nation is
POD1000000021_S0000307	hamstrung by these new rules duke held fewer rallies as a candidate for governor than when he ran for the senate and edwards fundraising slowed to a trickle
POD1000000021_S0000308	he would raised $160 during the 1983 governor is race
POD1000000021_S0000309	in the 1991 primary he brought in a little more than $10
POD1000000021_S0000310	and buddy romer he preferred staying in to going out to meet his public
POD1000000021_S0000311	romer had always been like this
POD1000000021_S0000312	raymond strother saw it up close during the 1987 race
POD1000000021_S0000313	he was sitting in the back of the campaign headquarters and reading novels usually mystery novels and he would not go out and campaign
POD1000000021_S0000314	we would go to a restaurant to eat lunch and he would sit in the back of the restaurant in a corner with his back to the room
POD1000000021_S0000315	so nobody would see him and recognize him and come over and start talking
POD1000000021_S0000316	romer is charismatic misanthrope routine had worked out fine in 1987
POD1000000021_S0000317	and it seemed possible he could pull off the same trick in 1991
POD1000000021_S0000318	michelle schauer started volunteering for the romer campaign when she was still in college at louisiana tech then got a job on staff right after graduation
POD1000000021_S0000319	she says that when the governor did make public appearances early on he seemed totally energized
POD1000000021_S0000320	and he literally walked into the room you know pushing both doors open
POD1000000021_S0000321	good afternoon everybody great to see you
POD1000000021_S0000322	you know he was clapping and smiling and really exuberant
POD1000000021_S0000323	and it was really very exciting to be in a room with him
POD1000000021_S0000324	he was just really engaging the crowd
POD1000000021_S0000325	and i would say for the 1st part of the campaign that is the way he was he really came into a room and made it alive
POD1000000021_S0000326	the problem for romer was that a lot of swing voters felt drawn to another candidate
POD1000000021_S0000327	at 1st strother liked the focus group results he was hearing
POD1000000021_S0000328	blue collar democrats said they could not stand a hypothetical candidate with all of david duke is characteristics
POD1000000021_S0000329	but then as soon as they learned it was david duke they would say well that is what politicians do
POD1000000021_S0000330	well you know kkk
POD1000000021_S0000331	well he was a young man nazi well he was a young guy
POD1000000021_S0000332	college kids do stupid stuff you know whatever it was they would make an excuse for him
POD1000000021_S0000333	while romer struggled to hold his coalition together duke was finding a new way to expand his appeal
POD1000000021_S0000334	it has been tough for me sometimes over the last couple of years a lot of media attacks but what is made it better for me is that i am a christian
POD1000000021_S0000335	i work hard i believe in christ and i am going to keep on fighting for you and for the future of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000336	thank you very much
POD1000000021_S0000338	duke invoked his christianity far more in the governor is race than in any of his previous campaigns
POD1000000021_S0000339	he used religion as both a shield and a sword
POD1000000021_S0000340	at a debate in september duke said that he would repented for his past sins and that those who tried to discredit him were being unchristian
POD1000000021_S0000341	i have certainly been intolerant before in my life
POD1000000021_S0000342	but those who would condemn and point their fingers at me i would like them to look in their own lives and ask if they would never hurt a friend or changed their opinions
POD1000000021_S0000343	it was not clear based on polling how white people in louisiana were responding to duke is latest attempt at image management
POD1000000021_S0000344	susan howell had been struggling for years to get a handle on duke is voters
POD1000000021_S0000345	howell was a professor of political science at the university of new orleans
POD1000000021_S0000346	she would taken her 1st look at duke during his run for the statehouse when his opponent john trean hired her to do a phone survey
POD1000000021_S0000347	howell is poll in the primary had duke at 7% she was off by 26 points
POD1000000021_S0000348	and i was stunned and then john trine stood up on a table and he was stunned too
POD1000000021_S0000349	i remember him saying the people of metairie are not racist
POD1000000021_S0000350	and i thought well maybe we should rethink that
POD1000000021_S0000351	trine fired howl after the primary so she would have to wait to pull another duke race
POD1000000021_S0000352	but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on with his supporters
POD1000000021_S0000353	people were reluctant to say i am going to vote for duke because they were afraid of being labeled racist even though they are talking to you know on an anonymous phone call to a pollster
POD1000000021_S0000354	it is like people are reluctant to say how much alcohol they drink or were they ever arrested
POD1000000021_S0000355	this became a research challenge for howell and her graduate students how could they get david duke is silent army to break its silence
POD1000000021_S0000356	we came up with some alternate i would call sneakier indirect questions to identify someone who might be sympathetic to duke
POD1000000021_S0000357	one of them which actually worked pretty well in increasing the duke support in the poll was to ask people if they approve or disapprove of the martin luther king holiday
POD1000000021_S0000358	howell conducted a survey one month before the gubernatorial primary
POD1000000021_S0000359	respondents were asked who they were voting for and also how they felt about statements like if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites
POD1000000021_S0000360	the raw number showed that 35% of people were voting for buddy romer 30% for edwin edwards and 12% for david duke
POD1000000021_S0000361	but when howell accounted for her sneakier indirect questions support for romer and edwards dipped and duke is support doubled
POD1000000021_S0000362	given the margin of error the election was too close to call
POD1000000021_S0000364	that is how things looked from the outside on the inside there was gossip about a possible secret alliance in the governor is race
POD1000000021_S0000365	romer is political consultant raymond strother heard that speculation
POD1000000021_S0000366	the rumor that we heard was that edwin edwards was encouraging and perhaps funding david duke
POD1000000021_S0000368	edwards wanted revenge on buddy roemer after losing to him in 1987 but edwards also knew how to play the odds
POD1000000021_S0000369	he was smart enough the theory went to sense that he would have a better shot against an ex klansman than against the incumbent governor
POD1000000021_S0000370	nobody had any proof whatsoever
POD1000000021_S0000371	but i seldom ran into anybody on either side who did not think that edwards was playing funny with david duke
POD1000000021_S0000373	when i got edwards on the phone .
POD1000000021_S0000374	i asked if there was any truth to all that chatter
POD1000000021_S0000376	did he or his supporters do anything to help duke make the runoff
POD1000000021_S0000377	like either giving him money or or propping him up in some way
POD1000000021_S0000378	did you or your supporters do anything to help duke get into the runoff with you
POD1000000021_S0000379	no i did not i did not do that because i did not think it was necessary and i would have maybe got caught at it so i did not do that
POD1000000021_S0000380	i just let him run his race i ran mine roma ran his
POD1000000021_S0000382	and that is as far as i got chasing down that rumor
POD1000000021_S0000383	but i did learn something else
POD1000000021_S0000384	the edwards campaign it turns out had a totally different secret alliance
POD1000000021_S0000386	clyde holloway was the pro life congressman who would gotten the official endorsement of the louisiana republican party
POD1000000021_S0000387	instead of duke or romer he was way back in the polls in a distant 4th and needed cash to air commercials
POD1000000021_S0000388	one of edwin edwards closest friends
POD1000000021_S0000390	new one of holloway is campaign advisors
POD1000000021_S0000391	to him of course as the 2 of them hatched a plan
POD1000000021_S0000392	he would show me results of a tracking poll which our people confirmed that every vote
POD1000000021_S0000393	that holloway was receiving or getting was coming directly off of the sitting governor buddy romo
POD1000000021_S0000394	and we would have people that were maxed out or have a lot of money that supported
POD1000000021_S0000395	that was asking what else they could do so we would get these commercials on tv and radio
POD1000000021_S0000396	i said that would help us possibly getting in the 2nd primary with david duke rather than us sitting in belvidere

POD1000000021_S0000401	we felt that we could beat david duke substantially and marty romo would have been a different result

POD1000000021_S0000404	did governor edwards know about this strategy
POD1000000021_S0000405	yes i informed him that it was going on and his answer was be careful
POD1000000021_S0000407	when i asked edwards about the alliance he told me he did not know anything about it
POD1000000021_S0000408	in john mcginnis book about the 1991 campaign clyde holloway is campaign advisor brian wagner also denied making any such deal

POD1000000021_S0000411	to be clear none of this would have been illegal assuming the campaign contributions got reported
POD1000000021_S0000412	but it was kind of devious a way to help david duke without giving him direct support
POD1000000021_S0000413	i do not want to make this alliance seem more important than it was
POD1000000021_S0000414	those holloway ads were just a small drop in an enormous bucket of campaign spending
POD1000000021_S0000415	in the final days of the race the owner of a hazardous waste recycling company spent a massive amount of money on anti romer commercials because he was angry about the governor is environmental regulations
POD1000000021_S0000416	that add by was a huge deal
POD1000000021_S0000417	the holloway ads really were not
POD1000000021_S0000418	but it is still telling that the edwards campaign was willing to take active measures to help duke get into the runoff
POD1000000021_S0000419	i think it is very typical of edwin edwards
POD1000000021_S0000420	that is quinn hillier he was one of louisiana is most prominent anti duke republicans
POD1000000021_S0000421	he also thinks edwards is totally corrupt
POD1000000021_S0000422	here is what he had to say about the edwards holloway alliance
POD1000000021_S0000423	i am not saying it is immoral it is just amoral completely without regard to the morality of trying to help david duke get into the runoff and whether or not that would be good or bad for the state of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000424	it certainly was playing every political angle and it was edwin edwards and his people at their edwin edwards est
POD1000000021_S0000426	this was in some ways typical louisiana chicanery
POD1000000021_S0000427	politics is sport with a win at all cost mentality
POD1000000021_S0000428	but duke was not a typical candidate
POD1000000021_S0000429	maybe the edwards camp was right that their odds were better against duke than romer
POD1000000021_S0000430	but what if they were wrong what if david duke won

POD1000000021_S0000442	now almost 3 years later he was a star and a contender

POD1000000021_S0000453	and then david duke himself took the stage
POD1000000021_S0000454	with every minute ladies and gentlemen it appears that we will be in a runoff for the governorship of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000456	back in 1989 at duke is 1st victory party he would shouted about winning a state house seat without any big political endorsements

POD1000000021_S0000458	in 1991 he did not sound bitter or vengeful
POD1000000021_S0000459	this david duke was smooth humble conciliatory
POD1000000021_S0000460	he would figured out how he was supposed to sound and how to make an appeal that was not entirely based on grievance

POD1000000021_S0000464	and that is jesus christ ladies and gentlemen
POD1000000021_S0000467	david duke was in the runoff with 32% of the vote
POD1000000021_S0000468	duke finished just 2 points behind the leader
POD1000000021_S0000469	edwin edwards buddy romer is political consultant raymond strother knew his man was going to come in 3rd
POD1000000021_S0000470	he went to bed at the governor is mansion before the race got called
POD1000000021_S0000471	and the next morning i got up and i went down to get my cookies and milk
POD1000000021_S0000472	and buddy was down there and he said well you did not have a good candidate did you
POD1000000021_S0000473	i said must not have buddy
POD1000000021_S0000474	he said well we took our best shot and he walked out and that is the last time i have ever spoken to him
POD1000000021_S0000475	buddy romer finished 5 points behind david duke
POD1000000021_S0000476	ultimately he was not taken down by an electoral conspiracy
POD1000000021_S0000477	he would lost because louisiana did not want a reformer
POD1000000021_S0000478	and tonight the people spoke and they said buddy thanks but you did not do enough and i think that is fair
POD1000000021_S0000479	when michelle schauer started working on the campaign she had been inspired by buddy roemer is energy
POD1000000021_S0000480	but now that it was over schauer thought romer actually seemed relieved
POD1000000021_S0000481	she found her own feelings harder to pin down
POD1000000021_S0000482	she was thinking about leaving the state maybe going to live with her parents in montana
POD1000000021_S0000483	but then she got approached by some people she knew from the louisiana republican party
POD1000000021_S0000484	they said we have an offer for you before you reject it outright
POD1000000021_S0000485	just listen to us and they said you could go to work on david duke is campaign
POD1000000021_S0000486	and of course my eyes widen like are you crazy
POD1000000021_S0000487	schauer had never considered supporting david duke much less working for him
POD1000000021_S0000488	her family had been on government aid when she was growing up so his rants against welfare were not persuasive
POD1000000021_S0000489	but schauer really did not want edwin edwards back in charge of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000490	plus those people from the state party told her that she did not need to take a public facing role
POD1000000021_S0000491	that she could stay in the shadows
POD1000000021_S0000492	schauer agreed to meet with duke is campaign manager howie farrell
POD1000000021_S0000493	when they got together he said that the time had come to broaden the duke operation by bringing in people from the establishment
POD1000000021_S0000494	schauer wanted to be a campaign manager someday
POD1000000021_S0000495	and she liked the idea of learning from one she was also unemployed
POD1000000021_S0000496	so from my perspective i had a job and an opportunity to look at an alternate campaign and that is how i started
POD1000000021_S0000498	during her stint as a duke staffer michelle shower would hear things that shocked her
POD1000000021_S0000499	she would also make a lot of phone calls on behalf of david duke using a list she would brought with her from the romer campaign
POD1000000021_S0000500	that list was the main reason the duke campaign had hired schauer
POD1000000021_S0000501	romer is supporters were now up for grabs if they voted republican in the november runoff
POD1000000021_S0000502	then david duke was going to be the governor of louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000503	the state republican party was still not going to support duke publicly but he was the last republican standing
POD1000000021_S0000504	and when schauer talked to her friends in the party they said they knew how to keep duke under control
POD1000000021_S0000505	when i would have those discussions they would say you know there is not much he can do
POD1000000021_S0000506	he is going to have so many eyes on him if he wins
POD1000000021_S0000507	there is so many eyes we are going to have people around him
POD1000000021_S0000508	he will not be able to push forward any of these agendas from his past
POD1000000021_S0000509	he will have to stick to the policies
POD1000000021_S0000510	and at that time i believed them
POD1000000021_S0000511	and at that time i thought while i was not really willing to say i was for him i was more for sweeping in a republican governor to try to fix things in louisiana
POD1000000021_S0000512	that is really where i was coming from at that time
POD1000000021_S0000514	next time on the final episode of our season 4 weeks to decide the fate of louisiana what would david duke do to win

POD1000000021_S0000531	thanks for listening
POD1000000023_S0000000	hello everyone i am stephen west this is philosophize this thank you to everyone that continues to support the show on patreon and a special thank you to those of you that upped your pledge during these uncertain times
POD1000000023_S0000001	i am beyond grateful and i am not going to take up any more of your time today is episode is on the political philosophy of richard rorty i hope you love the show today
POD1000000023_S0000003	so if you are having a political discussion with someone and the conversation took a turn and all of a sudden you guys are talking about human rights
POD1000000023_S0000004	there is certainly a lot of different angles you could approach that discussion from but one of the most common ones might be what philosophical grounding can we give to something like human rights
POD1000000023_S0000005	i mean we all think human beings have rights but where exactly do those rights come from who or what out there guarantees these rights for people
POD1000000023_S0000006	well a common answer to this question might be that human rights are inherited by birthright simply by virtue of being born every human being is entitled to certain natural rights or inalienable rights
POD1000000023_S0000007	rights that protect the dignity of a human life at such a basic level that to go against them starts to seem like you would be going against nature
POD1000000023_S0000008	now as far as the philosophical grounding is concerned this is an attitude much more common during the beginning of the enlightenment than it is today
POD1000000023_S0000009	and the 2 main thinkers that took on this position are often cited to be john locke and immanuel kant
POD1000000023_S0000010	when it comes to answering the question of who or what guarantees these human rights john locke goes in the direction of god you know we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights
POD1000000023_S0000011	and kant goes more in the direction of a priori facts derived from reason but either way these thinkers are in their own way trying to use reason to arrive at a universal that guarantees human beings are born with natural rights
POD1000000023_S0000012	little did either of these thinkers know that just 140 years later we would be immersed in 2 world wars that would make the argument for the natural rights of human beings seem about as important as neck ruffles were to them
POD1000000023_S0000013	see as we have talked about on this show the early 20th century was full of thinkers dissatisfied with what the enlightenment had produced they even went so far as to say that the entire project of the enlightenment was destined to consume itself from the start
POD1000000023_S0000014	yeah sure at the beginning reason calls into question much of the religious dogma of the middle ages but what inevitably has to happen once it gets done with that job is reason has to start questioning the new foundations for things
POD1000000023_S0000015	reason has to start questioning itself which then leads to philosophers using the process of rationality to find out that rationality is not some unbiased ahistorical measuring tool
POD1000000023_S0000016	it is not some neutral point from which we can make unambiguous claims about the truth of human rights or more importantly the universe to the thinker we are going to be talking about today richard rorty
POD1000000023_S0000017	people like locke and kant were no more discovering a truth about what grounds human rights than hammurabi was before them
POD1000000023_S0000018	but unlike many of the thinkers of the early 20th century who may have felt a bit disenfranchised by the rational process richard rorty felt optimistic about rationality
POD1000000023_S0000019	some people called rorty a postmodernist which would usually place him in staunch opposition to anything that even sounds like the word enlightenment
POD1000000023_S0000020	like excitement but let me tell you rorty was a very exciting man he rejected the title of postmodernist and most titles for that matter
POD1000000023_S0000021	he operated in a very unique realm for a thinker where like a typical post structuralist he did not believe in any sort of grand narrative that could explain away the universe
POD1000000023_S0000022	but yet he was still a die hard card carrying fan of the project of the enlightenment overall
POD1000000023_S0000023	see in a world where there is so many 20th century thinkers hating on the enlightenment here is a guy some people viewed as a post structuralist coming to its defense
POD1000000023_S0000024	let me explain why he would even do something like this
POD1000000023_S0000025	when immanuel kant in his famous essay describes the enlightenment as man is removal of his self incurred tutelage yeah he is talking about the tutelage of the religious dogma of the past
POD1000000023_S0000026	but rorty would extend that tutelage to the rational dogma that was to come in the future because of how overambitious we were at the beginning of the enlightenment about what rationality could produce
POD1000000023_S0000027	the spirit of the enlightenment to rorty was not to use reason to arrive at the truth about the universe
POD1000000023_S0000028	it was ultimately a call to subvert traditional forms of authority the significance of the enlightenment was not to land on new answers
POD1000000023_S0000029	it was to question old assumptions so in that sense yeah the initial project of the enlightenment ultimately consumed itself
POD1000000023_S0000030	but to richard brody the initial project of the enlightenment was meant to consume itself thinkers like isaiah berlin that would come along and suggest a pluralistic vision of things
POD1000000023_S0000031	this was not an anti enlightenment idea at all to rorty this was the project of the enlightenment left to play itself out
POD1000000023_S0000032	thinkers like berlin were always going to eventually come along
POD1000000023_S0000033	see the project of the enlightenment maturing through people like isaiah berlin taught us a couple of extremely valuable insights
POD1000000023_S0000034	one of which was that we do not need to try to use reason to appeal to some ultimate authority or universal to ground our ideas
POD1000000023_S0000035	rationality is not a tool that gets us to objectivity about things
POD1000000023_S0000036	but it may get us a very effective mix of intersubjectivity between cultures
POD1000000023_S0000037	wordy wants to offer an alternative way of looking at the legacy of the enlightenment
POD1000000023_S0000038	maybe it is pointless to try to do our best impressions of locke and kant and to try to access the universe through reason
POD1000000023_S0000039	but when it comes to strictly human institutions for example the political realm where we are not trying to access things in themselves
POD1000000023_S0000040	we are just trying to figure out how we can live together the best maybe that is where rationality thrives as a method
POD1000000023_S0000041	what all this is alluding to is the fact that human rights are not the only things philosophers have tried to ground in universals in the past
POD1000000023_S0000042	the very structure of some political systems liberalism for example has also historically been grounded in universals
POD1000000023_S0000043	once again i just want to clarify because there is some people out there that get angry very quickly
POD1000000023_S0000044	and they also must be part of some sort of email club that is out there
POD1000000023_S0000045	when we are talking about liberalism as a foundation for society we are talking about a government with a focus on individual rights consent to the governed an aversion to any sort of collectivist system or systems that were popular at other points in history maybe a caste system for example
POD1000000023_S0000046	now you can imagine if you are a philosopher and you are trying to make a case for liberalism being better than a caste system
POD1000000023_S0000047	it might be tempting to start to make an argument that human beings at the level of the universe are all equal and therefore should not be relegated to different ranks within a society
POD1000000023_S0000048	but to rorty this would be making the same mistake that locke and kant made in our example from before about human rights
POD1000000023_S0000049	the fact is to rorty we do not need that sort of ultimate foundation to be able to make a case for the fact that liberalism is how we should be running things
POD1000000023_S0000050	for many different reasons one like we already said we can not actually access the universe at that level through rationality
POD1000000023_S0000051	2 society is just far better off when it can base public policy on the rational consensus of individual citizens rather than a philosophical theory arrived at by some guy in a tower that people might not even be able to relate to
POD1000000023_S0000052	think of the limitations you instantly place on yourself if you decide that every public policy or value of a society needs to be grounded in some philosophical justification that tells you how human beings are at large
POD1000000023_S0000053	1st of all let us say you decide to structure your society around the political philosophy of plato
POD1000000023_S0000054	you are soon going to find yourself on a constant pr campaign trying to continuously sell these ideas to a population just crossing your fingers that they go along with it
POD1000000023_S0000055	2nd of all almost always these philosophical ideas that you might structure your society around were created in an entirely different culture that emerged out of an entirely different history
POD1000000023_S0000056	which means these theories can bring a lot of baggage along with them that you may not want in the present culture
POD1000000023_S0000057	thirdly you are always going to be fighting a sort of losing battle to rorty because he will always be trying to cram one interpretation of how human life should be structured into the enormously complex pluralistic maelstrom of people coexisting together
POD1000000023_S0000058	rorty is essentially saying maybe we do not need the philosopher up in the tower thinking all day telling us how to structure our societies because well i have decided it shores up with how the universe is
POD1000000023_S0000059	maybe we do not have access to the way the universe is but maybe that does not matter maybe we do not need some elaborate philosophical theory to structure our society for us maybe a strategy is legitimate
POD1000000023_S0000060	liberalism for instance if the citizens of a particular culture positioned in history at a particular time and place all the citizens facing a very specific set of common problems that they need to solve
POD1000000023_S0000061	maybe a strategy is legitimate if the people of that society decide that they have confidence in it because one thing is for sure one ultimate theory is not good enough
POD1000000023_S0000062	rorty who was a huge fan of isaiah berlin sometimes talks in his work about the quote fact of pluralism
POD1000000023_S0000063	this is what a society is tabordi we are worse off as a society if we try to use a single religious or philosophical theory to justify our political strategy
POD1000000023_S0000064	you will always be fighting a losing battle people will always arrive at a bunch of different conclusions
POD1000000023_S0000065	so instead of embarking on a never ending sales campaign for an idea wordy suggests that we allow our political strategy to reflect the common values of the people that make up the culture
POD1000000023_S0000066	he writes about how if we do this and we are careful eventually if you were having that same conversation at the beginning of the episode and you ask somebody what grounds human rights
POD1000000023_S0000067	the common tendency will not be to try to appeal to something written into the universe or to cite some religious or philosophical justification you read in a book somewhere
POD1000000023_S0000068	the new standard will be for people to see social policy as legitimate if it was approved by the people actually living in the culture
POD1000000023_S0000069	when asked the question what grounds this piece of social policy the answer will not involve pointing to some philosopher from 300 years ago
POD1000000023_S0000070	you know descartes famous work a treatise concerning why drugs should be legalized and why you should be able to use your cell phone on an airplane no no
POD1000000023_S0000071	the authority lies in the hands of the set of people positioned in history with a very specific set of problems to solve that they care about
POD1000000023_S0000072	and once again tororti not only do we not need any more authority than that we do not have access to any authority other than that and we are better off this way anyway
POD1000000023_S0000073	should be said this is yet another way we can access an answer to the question of how we can find a bridge between nature and culture
POD1000000023_S0000074	rorty obviously is not appealing to a single theory but he also is not appealing to pure relativism or historicism
POD1000000023_S0000075	his answers to these questions about how we can justify our political strategy place him in what i think is the most accurate category to describe some of his biggest ideas
POD1000000023_S0000076	rorty is often thought of as a pragmatist and i think we can understand rorty is overall position a little bit better if we take a 2nd to talk about the concept of truth
POD1000000023_S0000077	more specifically the key differences between the traditional ways people have viewed the concept of truth and the way a pragmatist like rorty would have viewed the concept of truth
POD1000000023_S0000078	so let us talk 1st about one of the most common theories of what constitutes truth from the history of philosophy one that richard rorty thought has been dominant since the very beginning of the enlightenment
POD1000000023_S0000079	what he sometimes calls the representationalist paradigm sometimes called by others the correspondence theory of truth but let me take a 2nd to tell you exactly what it is
POD1000000023_S0000080	the most basic idea is suppose somebody says a statement about the way things are in the world how do we tell if that statement is true
POD1000000023_S0000081	well that statement is true if it represents the way things really are in the world if there is a correspondence between the description and reality then we can say it is true
POD1000000023_S0000082	now there is of course mountains of detail that we could talk about here but richard brody disagrees with the entire premise of the correspondence theory even at this basic rudimentary level
POD1000000023_S0000083	whenever you try to create a bridge between a description you have in your head and the reality of the world that you are looking at the only way you can ever describe anything is through language
POD1000000023_S0000084	language mediates our relationship with reality you can not access reality without language but to rorty it even goes one step further than this
POD1000000023_S0000085	not only is language a medium between us and reality but language actually constitutes reality
POD1000000023_S0000086	meaning that the language we use and the way we use it changes the way we think about reality
POD1000000023_S0000087	this could be an entire series on its own but the point is that certain languages and the cultures that use them favor certain habits of interpreting events
POD1000000023_S0000088	these interpretations greatly determine the entire way we see reality and the way human beings perceive reality varies greatly from culture to culture language to language
POD1000000023_S0000089	so the idea that there is some sort of correspondence or representation going on that the world out there is somehow helping us verify whether statements are true or false
POD1000000023_S0000090	that is just wrong because rorty thinks it would be impossible for us to ever step outside the parameters of language and access the world of things in themselves things independent of this language that we use to categorize them
POD1000000023_S0000091	he has a very famous quote that will be extremely useful for us for the remainder of the episode he said quote the world does not speak only we do
POD1000000023_S0000092	the world can once we have programmed ourselves with a language cause us to hold beliefs but it cannot propose a language for us to speak only human beings can do that
POD1000000023_S0000093	so it should be said rorty is not talking about ordinary language when he writes that he is talking about something else that we are going to get deep into here in a minute but i want to point out that this comparison he is making here
POD1000000023_S0000094	between accessing the world versus some sort of human created tool that is deeply affected by the bonds of history and culture
POD1000000023_S0000095	this is a classic move that rorty makes that if you were new to rorty might help you understand an outline of some of the topics he wants to cover for example language is extremely useful in human affairs
POD1000000023_S0000096	it is just not capable of describing the world of things in themselves outside of language
POD1000000023_S0000097	well consider how this compares to the beginning of the episode we have locke and kant trying to use reason to access some sort of ultimate truth about the universe but here is rorty saying that rationality is most useful in human affairs like the realm of the political
POD1000000023_S0000098	the world does not speak only we do here is another one from the enlightenment people like rousseau who believe in some sort of underlying human nature noble savages as he would say
POD1000000023_S0000099	really beyond that anyone that wants to take up the mantle of the common attitude that human beings at their very core dread seeing other human beings suffer
POD1000000023_S0000100	that is a common one for people to hold that naturally as human beings we do not want to see other people in pain so we can rely on the fact that if things ever got bad enough one culture would always come to the aid of another culture
POD1000000023_S0000101	rorty actually responds to this position directly in an interaction with simon critchley in the 90s so right here he is referencing the idea that there is some sort of default altruism embedded into human nature
POD1000000023_S0000102	he says quote maybe there is such a sentient disposition but it is so malleable so capable of being combined with indifference to the suffering of people of the wrong sorts that it gives us precious little to rely on
POD1000000023_S0000103	we should just thank our lucky stars that there are quite a lot of people nowadays who are pretty consistently appalled by human beings suffering unnecessarily
POD1000000023_S0000104	so we are saying maybe there is some aspect of human nature that makes people not want to see others suffer but if there is it is incredibly malleable
POD1000000023_S0000105	thank your lucky stars that there happen to be a lot of people living today who do not want to see unnecessary suffering but the larger point there is that also if you are a fan of liberalism
POD1000000023_S0000106	there is nothing written into nature like a god or a priori facts that say liberalism is the way
POD1000000023_S0000107	but thank your lucky stars for the last couple 100 years there have been a lot of people that believe in it as a strategy
POD1000000023_S0000108	so while we can understand the move that rorty is making here
POD1000000023_S0000109	placing a lot of authority in the hands of the people actually immersed in the culture this may start to bring up a whole new set of questions one of the most pressing might be this
POD1000000023_S0000110	if the authority of whether a social policy is good or not lies in the hands of the citizens and not even a philosopher can arrive at absolute foundations for even something as simple as human rights
POD1000000023_S0000111	do not those criticisms just instantly extend to my beliefs as an individual
POD1000000023_S0000112	like how am i supposed to ground my worldview in anything that is enduring enough that i can feel confident about it
POD1000000023_S0000113	the short answer to this question is that you can not and that should not bother you
POD1000000023_S0000114	the longer answer can be found in rorty is lengthy exploration of the concept of irony
POD1000000023_S0000115	let us talk about it right now so a common email i get is from a person who says something to the effect of this
POD1000000023_S0000116	hi i have been listening to the show for a while i have heard about a bunch of different philosophers and i have gotten to a place where i feel the complexity of things makes me feel pretty uncertain about choosing a worldview
POD1000000023_S0000117	sometimes i feel agnostic about almost every issue of substance i can think of but this creates a problem for me because i still need to operate in day to day life
POD1000000023_S0000118	how is it possible to live a life where you are radically uncertain about things but still capable of functioning on an everyday level
POD1000000023_S0000119	there are many answers to this question but richard rorty offers one of them through his discussion of living a life as an ironist
POD1000000023_S0000120	now by ironist he does not mean you are smelting metal down at the home depot every day the term ironist is a reference to irony
POD1000000023_S0000121	to fully understand the life of an ironist though we 1st need to understand the much more common almost ubiquitous way that people approach figuring things out about the world
POD1000000023_S0000122	a way of thinking deeply embedded in the history of philosophy
POD1000000023_S0000123	most people view their intellectual development as a person as a linear progression of moving past appearances and getting to the reality of the world
POD1000000023_S0000124	this goes all the way back to plato is allegory of the cave shadows on a cave wall we do the work of a philosopher and eventually can ascend out of the cave and see the sun or true knowledge for what it actually is
POD1000000023_S0000125	well this way of viewing ourselves has been a fixture in our cultures for so long that it is the way many people see their process of growth when learning about the world
POD1000000023_S0000126	there is this intuitive sense that we are born we are young dumb naive we get information from our teachers parents basic news sources and there is a sense in which we are living in a world of appearances at this point
POD1000000023_S0000127	see it is not until we have done the work of reading 5 newspapers a day reading a 1000 books traveling to a 100 different countries not until we have done that can we say that we have arrived at a worldview that sees reality on reality is terms
POD1000000023_S0000128	but just as there is no single theory embedded into the universe about human rights or political strategy or anything for that matter
POD1000000023_S0000129	there is no single correct view of existence that you are somehow accessing through life experiences and reading a bunch of stuff
POD1000000023_S0000130	you may think that you have a rational justification for every view that you hold you may think it is the greatest worldview that is ever been created
POD1000000023_S0000131	but it was created by you by a human being and rorty would say that although we often deceive ourselves into thinking it is the truth
POD1000000023_S0000132	really what we have created here is what he calls a final vocabulary
POD1000000023_S0000133	more on final vocabularies in 12nd but 1st i think it would be helpful to hear rorty talk about a key distinction between someone saying the world is out there and saying the truth is out there
POD1000000023_S0000134	and how these statements ultimately relate to the language we use he says quote we need to make a distinction between the claim that the world is out there and the claim that the truth is out there
POD1000000023_S0000135	to say that the world is out there that it is not our creation is to say with common sense that most things in space and time are the effects of causes which do not include human mental states
POD1000000023_S0000136	to say that the truth is not out there is simply to say that where there are no sentences there is no truth that sentences are elements of human languages
POD1000000023_S0000137	and that human languages are human creations truth cannot be out there it cannot exist independently of the human mind
POD1000000023_S0000138	because sentences cannot so exist or be out there the world is out there but descriptions of the world are not
POD1000000023_S0000139	only descriptions of the world can be true or false the world on its own unaided by the describing activities of human beings cannot
POD1000000023_S0000140	this is one of rorty is most famous concepts what many refer to as the distinction between making and finding
POD1000000023_S0000141	locke and kant are not finding the truth about human rights they are using a very human process called reason to make a truth about human rights that we then use to structure our societies
POD1000000023_S0000142	liberalism was not found to be the best political strategy historical circumstances and common values among people made it the best political strategy for a time
POD1000000023_S0000143	when you read a 1000 books you are not finding the truth about existence you are making a final vocabulary that allows you to interface with reality during the specific time that you happen to be living
POD1000000023_S0000144	by final vocabulary rorty means a collection of stories metaphors narratives discourses tons of different tools of rhetoric that you use to make sense of the world and see your place in it
POD1000000023_S0000145	this is called a final vocabulary because the things that make it up are often very final the foundations are probably not going to develop any further because when it comes down to it if you are pressed hard enough
POD1000000023_S0000146	to explain your worldview by somebody skilled enough at arguing with enough time on their hands rorty says that eventually there would be no way for you to explain why your worldview is better than anyone else is in a non circular way
POD1000000023_S0000147	it is a courageous thing to fight and die for your country because look fighting and dying for your country is like one of the most courageous things you can do the bible is true so you should trust the word of god
POD1000000023_S0000148	when pressed hard enough to justify your worldview in a conversation these are the sorts of stories and metaphors that ground the values of someone that thinks they have got it all figured out
POD1000000023_S0000149	when the more accurate description is that they set up camp in an echo chamber of people that do not call them on their mistakes
POD1000000023_S0000150	either because they only talk to people who mostly agree with them already or because the people that disagree with them that they allow into their circles lack the ability to press them further maybe people just want to be polite
POD1000000023_S0000151	maybe other people just do not care enough about changing someone into a little version of them to spend their time doing it
POD1000000023_S0000152	rorty prescribes an antidote to this way of thinking about getting past appearances to the reality of the world here is a pretty famous passage from his work that describes his 3 criteria for living life as an ironist
POD1000000023_S0000153	he says quote i shall define an ironist as someone who fulfills 3 conditions
POD1000000023_S0000154	one she has radical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently uses because she has been impressed by other vocabularies vocabularies taken as final by people or books she has encountered
POD1000000023_S0000155	2 she realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts
POD1000000023_S0000156	3 insofar as she philosophizes about her situation she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others that it is in touch with a power not herself
POD1000000023_S0000157	ironists who are inclined to philosophize see the choice between vocabularies as made neither within a neutral or universal meta vocabulary not by an attempt to fight one is way past appearances to the real but simply by playing the new off against the old
POD1000000023_S0000158	so imagine living life as an ironist as opposed to this other type of person we were just talking about
POD1000000023_S0000159	you would live your day to day life not like pyrrho from ancient athens you are not going to walk in front of cars doubting whether or not they are actually there you would have a sort of working theory a final vocabulary that you use to function
POD1000000023_S0000160	the difference would be that you would have seen other final vocabularies seen their weaknesses
POD1000000023_S0000161	and you would realize that yours is probably equally as flawed as theirs is in some way because it is not like you have special access to the truth
POD1000000023_S0000162	you do not have a deity backing your worldview you do not have some neutral point outside of culture and history that you are doing your thinking from you are just as fallible as they are
POD1000000023_S0000163	and your conclusions rely on history and culture just as much as theirs do you would have continuing radical doubt about your relationship with reality
POD1000000023_S0000164	you would also realize that any attempt by you to argue that your final vocabulary is somehow superior to others is a pointless exercise and it is actually you engaging in that circular reasoning we were talking about before
POD1000000023_S0000165	because think about it you are arguing for a set of stories and narratives as being superior but all the while you are using that set of stories and narratives as the premise that you are starting your arguments from
POD1000000023_S0000166	this is why rorty thinks that when it comes to our final vocabularies arguing in the traditional sense is not a very effective way of making any progress at all
POD1000000023_S0000167	rorty says that an ironist always realizes that anything can be made to look good or bad by being redescribed
POD1000000023_S0000168	because it is not like there is some single argumentative standard out there
POD1000000023_S0000169	winning an argument in the times of napoleon is just far different than winning an argument today
POD1000000023_S0000170	because the values of the people judging have changed the historical circumstances have changed the story about how the world fits together has changed different arguments are more effective in different final vocabularies
POD1000000023_S0000171	so if you are going to argue with someone you are always relying on the fact that your points are going to fit well into the final vocabulary of the person that you are arguing with which is far from a guarantee
POD1000000023_S0000172	and the other side of that is that you may find yourself constantly arguing against a particular common final vocabulary that happens to dominate the culture you were born into
POD1000000023_S0000173	better to instead lead by example through irony when someone thinks they have lassoed the truth with their vocabulary they got it
POD1000000023_S0000174	the far more effective method will always be to do what rorty calls ironic disruption which does not mean you pull out your richard rorty handbook and argue them down point by point until they see the world the way that you do
POD1000000023_S0000175	the goal is through one method or another usually rhetorical devices
POD1000000023_S0000176	you try to allow this person to see on their own the perspective from outside their single worldview the hope being that once they are in this place they will realize how limiting their basic way of viewing the world is
POD1000000023_S0000177	because it completely closes them off from new ways of connecting with people ideas and the world that is out there once again the world that is out there not the truth that is out there
POD1000000023_S0000178	to be in this place stepping outside of your worldview and seeing a completely different way the world could be rationally justified can be transformative
POD1000000023_S0000179	should be said this process also benefits the ironist because they need as much experience with final vocabularies as they can get they need to be able to spot these from a mile away
POD1000000023_S0000180	rorty says in a passage that an ironist is never quite able to take themselves seriously
POD1000000023_S0000181	because they lived their life acknowledging how much of their final vocabulary was not even a choice they consciously made
POD1000000023_S0000182	and that at any point some of the issues they believe in most strongly today might tomorrow change in a single conversation
POD1000000023_S0000183	this is a very different approach to your intellectual development and a very different way of approaching conversations with people that disagree with you politically
POD1000000023_S0000184	this person would seem like an alien in the current political landscape but this is ultimately the type of person that emerges in a pluralistic landscape of ideas rather than one that believes in a single correct answer to every political question
POD1000000023_S0000185	so you may wonder why bother why even spend a 2nd of my life trying to talk to somebody showing them how they are limiting themselves to a single answer
POD1000000023_S0000186	let them do whatever it is they are going to do
POD1000000023_S0000187	this outdated oversimplified attitude is responsible for so much of the cruelty that goes on in this world
POD1000000023_S0000188	liberal society in his eyes has a constant obligation to remind ourselves of the ways that the current order of things might be hurting people around us much more effective when you have a pluralistic outlook
POD1000000023_S0000190	you know there are relativists out there that would make an argument that everybody should stop fighting over their petty disagreements because ultimately everything is arbitrary
POD1000000023_S0000191	there are capital r rationalists out there that will say everyone should stop fighting because well i have come up with the right answer i found it no more work to be done
POD1000000023_S0000192	the way richard rorty walks this line of nature and culture is partially through his beautiful use of pragmatism you know rorty would not say you should care less he would not say you should care more
POD1000000023_S0000193	what he would say i think though is that the substance of what we care about lies in solidarity amongst fellow human beings
POD1000000023_S0000194	that solidarity is what keeps us in line not a cosmic law that solidarity is what determines our values not some philosopher up in a tower
POD1000000023_S0000195	to understand the historical and cultural environment that you live in is only the 1st step towards understanding the solidarity that holds society together
POD1000000023_S0000196	he said it well when describing one of his books here and one of the most famous passages from any of his work
POD1000000023_S0000197	he says quote
POD1000000023_S0000198	end quote
POD1000000023_S0000199	thank you for listening i will talk to you next time
POD1000000024_S0000000	i dreaded doing the show sometimes because whatever it was
POD1000000024_S0000001	feelings
POD1000000024_S0000002	yeah feelings feelings
POD1000000024_S0000003	i do not know if we had sort of an acknowledgement at that point that things were strained between us
POD1000000024_S0000004	but we were definitely not as close as we had once been by the time that that was happening
POD1000000024_S0000005	and part of this period of time is about the weird duality between becoming recognized as friends more publicly
POD1000000024_S0000006	even as we were spending less time in that kind of intimate communication that really makes a friendship feel safe and secure
POD1000000024_S0000007	i do not know does that feel right to you sorry
POD1000000024_S0000008	that feels so right please be my spokesperson for everything thank you

POD1000000024_S0000029	she specifically invited both of us to that party having already identified that we would probably get along and be friends
POD1000000024_S0000030	in the same way that someone would set you up on a blind date romantically
POD1000000024_S0000031	this was like a friendship like setup
POD1000000024_S0000032	i do remember just feeling like every comment and every joke and every little like aside or contribution she made to the kind of meta conversation happening about the tv show was just spot on
POD1000000024_S0000033	and just being like i could be here forever and listen to every single word that comes out of this woman is mouth
POD1000000024_S0000034	i just really liked your outfit anne
POD1000000024_S0000035	wow
POD1000000024_S0000036	i was like yes finally a good outfit in this town
POD1000000024_S0000037	like i remember that being really important to me
POD1000000024_S0000038	but i just remember really appreciating that this person was both like hilarious and also smart
POD1000000024_S0000039	and then much later when i connected the dots to the fact that 0 you were the anne friedman whose byline i had read before i was like great
POD1000000024_S0000040	everything makes sense now of course
POD1000000024_S0000041	this woman who wears this jeans and t shirts situation so perfectly also has like 10 out of 10 taste in teen television
POD1000000024_S0000042	and so you know it worked out really well for me
POD1000000024_S0000043	it just was easy right away
POD1000000024_S0000044	and so things escalated like very fast
POD1000000024_S0000045	we really went 0 to a 100 in like the 1st couple months
POD1000000024_S0000046	when i picture this time in our lives i just picture us spending dozens of hours on one of our couches
POD1000000024_S0000047	we just spent so many hours doing nothing
POD1000000024_S0000048	and in that way it felt very much like a college or a teen friendship to me
POD1000000024_S0000049	our 20s were very much marked by a lot of big group hangs you know
POD1000000024_S0000050	but i think that for me that when i knew that we were going to be friends for a long time is when it was okay to be like actually i do not want to be doing that
POD1000000024_S0000051	i just want to be taking our bras off on the couch and just talking about mundane stuff or like reading side by side like not really saying anything to each other
POD1000000024_S0000052	i had been living with a boyfriend and we broke up when you and i had been friends for 6 months or something like that
POD1000000024_S0000053	and then when i went to revise my hr paperwork at work like who is your next of kin or whatever they make you put down for work emergencies
POD1000000024_S0000054	at that point it was very clear that it was you
POD1000000024_S0000055	yeah by that point you were someone in my life where i was like yes like give her my 401 k
POD1000000024_S0000056	like please call her if i slip on a banana at work
POD1000000024_S0000058	this is the only capable person in my life thank you
POD1000000024_S0000059	your job at the banana factory
POD1000000024_S0000061	the people need to know
POD1000000024_S0000063	if i am found in a ditch somewhere i hope that my phone literally says please call anne friedman
POD1000000024_S0000065	but we have now been friends who live apart for much longer than we were friends who lived in the same city
POD1000000024_S0000066	i knew that eventually you would move because we lived in a very transitional kind of city
POD1000000024_S0000067	and we had talked about it and it was like the great recession like people moved to go to jobs like anywhere in the country
POD1000000024_S0000068	so it was not like it was a surprise that one of us would have to move
POD1000000024_S0000069	it just felt too soon
POD1000000024_S0000070	yeah and it is funny when i think about making that decision it was so wrapped up in work for me
POD1000000024_S0000071	even though obviously i was physically leaving our ability to spend all these hours on the couch together
POD1000000024_S0000072	i did not feel like our friendship was going to end or even be existentially threatened by the fact that i was moving away
POD1000000024_S0000073	and that is not to say that i was not sad about it or that it was easy
POD1000000024_S0000074	it is just at the time it really just felt like ok we are going to be as close as we ever were
POD1000000024_S0000075	it is just going to look a little different
POD1000000024_S0000076	i was devastated when you moved away anne and i remember very consciously having to make a choice of like i will never show this person that i am bummed out by this
POD1000000024_S0000077	because i knew just how important it was for you and i was also really excited for you that you were actually on a path to do something that you wanted to do
POD1000000024_S0000078	i do not shine if you do not shine is something that amina 1st said to me and then we would say to each other
POD1000000024_S0000079	mostly i think as an assurance when one of us was worried she was taking up too much space in the other is brain or life or whatever
POD1000000024_S0000080	maybe asking for too much support or help a way of reassuring each other that we were invested in each other
POD1000000024_S0000081	and i do not shine if you do not shine was the assurance that underpinned a lot of those conversations
POD1000000024_S0000082	i have always felt that collaboration is better than competition
POD1000000024_S0000083	every success in my life is a testament to that
POD1000000024_S0000084	and somewhere along the line we started calling it shine theory privately
POD1000000024_S0000085	and then in 2013 i was a columnist for the cut and wrote about it in a column
POD1000000024_S0000086	and lots of people read and shared the column and then it became a lot bigger than we had anticipated
POD1000000024_S0000087	but like all things that go viral there are also a lot of complications we were like great is everyone really on the same page about what we are talking about
POD1000000024_S0000088	i remember much to my surprise and horror shinetheory com had already been bought
POD1000000024_S0000089	a woman who ran a fitness studio was using it to push some sort of miss fitness studio contest
POD1000000024_S0000090	my name was on the website
POD1000000024_S0000091	and so a lawyer was hired
POD1000000024_S0000092	and i think that having to go through this experience with you anne like i make decisions differently when i am making decisions with someone than i do if i am making them for myself
POD1000000024_S0000093	you really learn that like people have different appetites for negotiation
POD1000000024_S0000094	and people have a different style that they want to be combative or not combative in and whatever
POD1000000024_S0000095	i think that having to sort out a lot of those kinks through this process illuminated a lot of things
POD1000000024_S0000096	and one of them being like okay this really sucks but i really like the person i have to do this with
POD1000000024_S0000097	it was important to me that we were able to make a decision this big together
POD1000000024_S0000098	you know and it was like that was not falling apart
POD1000000024_S0000099	the point at which we were trying to figure out what to do about the shine theory trademark was actually several months or maybe even dragged out for more than a year
POD1000000024_S0000100	and in that period of time i do not know if we had sort of an acknowledgment at that point that things were strained between us
POD1000000024_S0000101	but we were definitely not as close as we had once been by the time that that was happening
POD1000000024_S0000102	i think that we are entering into a period where a lot of things that we were compartmentalizing were starting to become problems you know
POD1000000024_S0000103	like we were both changing and going through really hard things in our own lives very far apart physically and emotionally in most cases
POD1000000024_S0000104	and i think for me also like this has been the central the lesson that i am learning as i grow up every day
POD1000000024_S0000105	people are changing constantly
POD1000000024_S0000106	and it is really hard to do a check in every day and realize that you were different than you were yesterday
POD1000000024_S0000107	and so i think that even if we were like living in the same city or we you know like bought a house together and we were roommates or whatever i still think that we would be 2 different people
POD1000000024_S0000108	clinging on to an idea of who i think someone is is very reassuring
POD1000000024_S0000109	but in that you do not give people room to change their minds or to explore new things or to do new things
POD1000000024_S0000110	we were different and we did not acknowledge it at the beginning and then we were changing and did not realize that we were changing
POD1000000024_S0000111	and there was so much to account for in that gap
POD1000000024_S0000112	and so for each of us deciding to share less of ourselves was sometimes a conscious and sometimes a totally unconscious reflexive decision
POD1000000024_S0000113	yet we had all of this communication related to hosting a podcast together
POD1000000024_S0000114	for years and years and years the only podcast that i listened to was this american life
POD1000000024_S0000115	so it never even occurred to me that it was something we could do
POD1000000024_S0000116	but i had met gina delvac our producer through anne and some of anne is friends in la and at some point somewhere in palm springs
POD1000000024_S0000117	like between probably drugs and wine for me it was suggested that we could do a podcast
POD1000000024_S0000118	i think she was just like you guys have good chemistry and you should think about doing this
POD1000000024_S0000119	and i am also pretty sure we said that standard thing that i hear most people who are women say when you suggest they record themselves which is i hate my voice so why would i do that or something like that
POD1000000024_S0000120	i am pretty sure we were kind of dismissive but then also that we thought about it and talked about it
POD1000000024_S0000121	several weeks later
POD1000000024_S0000122	do you remember when we were in the car and you bought the url on your phone
POD1000000024_S0000123	yes we came up with the name in the car
POD1000000024_S0000124	i confess that if i had really sat there and thought for longer than 30 seconds the show probably would not be called call your girlfriend
POD1000000024_S0000125	it would be called something else
POD1000000024_S0000126	indeed
POD1000000024_S0000127	but this is how we work
POD1000000024_S0000128	nothing is real unless there is a website
POD1000000024_S0000129	nothing is real unless you have had a meeting about it
POD1000000024_S0000130	and gina had done all of the work to say this is what we think it could be
POD1000000024_S0000131	and because she did that it made me feel like we could actually do it
POD1000000024_S0000132	we did not think that tons of strangers would listen to it
POD1000000024_S0000133	i think that a huge part of the show is success honestly is that we backed into all of these things
POD1000000024_S0000134	if they had come to me and said hey do you want to run a small media company where we have to get a government ein and we have to do payroll
POD1000000024_S0000135	i would have said absolutely not please never speak to me again this is not what i want to do
POD1000000024_S0000136	and it sounds like a really dumb thing to say now but it never occurred to me that people who were not our friends would listen to it
POD1000000024_S0000137	hi welcome to call your girlfriend
POD1000000024_S0000138	a podcast for long distance besties everywhere
POD1000000024_S0000139	usually we are long distance besties but today we are in the same room
POD1000000024_S0000140	i know we are cheating and i love it
POD1000000024_S0000141	but i dreaded doing the show sometimes because whatever
POD1000000024_S0000142	feelings
POD1000000024_S0000143	yeah feelings
POD1000000024_S0000144	when we are not communicating well and you add distance to it like that was an issue
POD1000000024_S0000145	or always thinking like okay we will deal with this later
POD1000000024_S0000146	there was always like a thing you know like a small thing that you would deal with later and then that jar got full and you are like 0 this is a lot of stuff
POD1000000024_S0000147	and it happened in so many little ways that we did not really even fully acknowledge it until things had gotten really bad
POD1000000024_S0000148	and i think part of this period of time is about the weird duality between becoming recognized as friends more publicly
POD1000000024_S0000149	even as we were spending less time in that kind of intimate communication that really makes a friendship feel safe and secure
POD1000000024_S0000150	i do not know does that feel right to you sorry
POD1000000024_S0000152	that feels so right please be my spokesperson for everything thank you
POD1000000024_S0000154	there was sort of this illusion that we were still in touch in the same way we had always been
POD1000000024_S0000155	even though we were not actually talking in truly intimate ways about what was happening in each of our lives
POD1000000024_S0000156	we were kind of talking about logistical things for work or we were talking about the news or pop culture on the podcast
POD1000000024_S0000157	you know the kinds of conversations that really underpinned our relationship in the beginning just were not happening anymore with the same frequency
POD1000000024_S0000158	i knew that we were not doing well but i knew that you did not hate me
POD1000000024_S0000159	the thing that was hard about our conflict is that we loved each other but we did not know how to communicate with each other
POD1000000024_S0000160	i do not remember what the words were that you said in that conversation but i just remember the relief i felt when you told me that you did not feel good
POD1000000024_S0000161	i feel awful i think is what i feel
POD1000000024_S0000163	thank you man
POD1000000024_S0000166	should have been a scary moment
POD1000000024_S0000167	should have been like 0 no and instead it was like thank god finally like it is all on the table
POD1000000024_S0000168	and i remember just feeling this huge sense of relief of great we are having a breakdown and we are talking about it i love it
POD1000000024_S0000169	and so that is how we ended up at couples therapy
POD1000000024_S0000170	does not it feel good to laugh about this now
POD1000000024_S0000171	like ooh expensive every laugh is the sound of 1000s of therapy dollars
POD1000000024_S0000173	we would like i do not know record the podcast and then you know like hang up that equipment and be like well are you ready to go to doctor so and so later
POD1000000024_S0000174	show up to therapy do that really hard work and also sometimes like agree or disagree with the therapist and be able to talk to each other about it
POD1000000024_S0000175	there is something about that that felt like such an out of body experience to me where i was like am i really this grown up
POD1000000024_S0000176	who like i worked with this person we are now at our therapist and now we are going to go home and lay on the floor because this was so hard
POD1000000024_S0000177	if you had not been at those therapy sessions with me i would not believe that it had happened
POD1000000024_S0000178	but it did happen and somehow we did it
POD1000000024_S0000179	right we both still wanted to be there
POD1000000024_S0000180	and like i think about that saying about like how do you stay married you just do not get divorced or whatever i do not know
POD1000000024_S0000181	but i will say that like we were both continuing to show up
POD1000000024_S0000182	in our friendship i have learned a lot about being someone who does not run away from their commitments
POD1000000024_S0000183	we felt like this experience we had had trying to repair an intimate friendship that had like hit the rocks is not something we saw reflected anywhere
POD1000000024_S0000184	and so there was a motivation i think to try to put some of this down in words
POD1000000024_S0000185	i think we started to talk about writing a book proposal in maybe 2017 does that sound right
POD1000000024_S0000186	yeah when it came to audio neither of us knew what we were doing and it was very much like okay great like we are starting from scratch
POD1000000024_S0000187	and with this you know anne is a writer
POD1000000024_S0000188	and i am her friend but i am also her fan
POD1000000024_S0000189	like i have read anne for years
POD1000000024_S0000190	and so i was really thinking about like how is this collaboration going to work
POD1000000024_S0000191	we sold this book as like we heard 2 quote equal authors and i was like great
POD1000000024_S0000192	i am like paired up with an olympian and now we have to do hurdles
POD1000000024_S0000194	you know a lot of books that are co written
POD1000000024_S0000195	you know in this 50 50 way have you know chapter ones by one person and then chapter 2s by the other person and they kind of volley back and forth
POD1000000024_S0000196	and we made a choice pretty early on that we wanted to have one narrative
POD1000000024_S0000197	and so as a project it is really impossible to disentangle our various inputs
POD1000000024_S0000198	and i do not know i feel like that feels truer to me in the sense of like that is really what a friendship feels like
POD1000000024_S0000199	and the way we did that is we outlined together quite meticulously and then we would take a section of the outline split up
POD1000000024_S0000200	we would each write narratively that section of the outline on our separate computers and then we would each read aloud what we had written to the other
POD1000000024_S0000201	and then we would knit them together and keep the best parts of both and then move on to the next section of the outline for 70000 words
POD1000000024_S0000202	wow
POD1000000024_S0000203	can you believe we did that
POD1000000024_S0000204	i am just like saying that out loud is wild
POD1000000024_S0000206	my truly like favorite moments of our writing process is when i would be frustrated or ready to give up and i would look around
POD1000000024_S0000207	and you were typing away furiously with your signature ann friedman typing noises and exclaim out loud i love words those were the moments
POD1000000024_S0000208	i can not believe you are outing me like this
POD1000000024_S0000209	i am outing you you are a capricorn writer and it is disgusting to be a part of but also it is you know i am like we got we did it
POD1000000024_S0000210	my favorite moments are hearing you from like the other end of the house be like okay okay
POD1000000024_S0000212	like where i could tell you were really working through something
POD1000000024_S0000213	like you had really had a breakthrough
POD1000000024_S0000215	one thing that is like truly consistent across every year of our friendship is that like i always do want to know what you think
POD1000000024_S0000216	i always do think you have the best jokes
POD1000000024_S0000217	that has never ever changed

POD1000000026_S0000009	i am kevin systrom former ceo and co founder of instagram

POD1000000026_S0000012	a year and a half later they sold it to facebook for a $10
POD1000000026_S0000013	they stayed on to run the company for another 6 years
POD1000000026_S0000014	and then in 2018 they left together
POD1000000026_S0000015	and even now they still work together
POD1000000026_S0000016	the 1st time they met though they had no idea that it would lead to something so meaningful
POD1000000026_S0000017	in fact kevin does not even remember that 1st time they met
POD1000000026_S0000019	i would like to say i do i really do not
POD1000000026_S0000020	the 1st time i remember meeting mike was in a coffee bar this small cafe in san francisco
POD1000000026_S0000021	it became my go to office because i had left my job and i was working on this app called bourbon
POD1000000026_S0000022	and it was just me
POD1000000026_S0000023	i knew of mike i had seen him like we are in the same circles
POD1000000026_S0000024	and i recognized mike and i walked over to say hello
POD1000000026_S0000025	but the 1st thing i noticed was the thing he was working on
POD1000000026_S0000026	there is like this beautiful website
POD1000000026_S0000027	and i did not realize he was working with a designer
POD1000000026_S0000028	so anyway in my mind mike was like this amazing designer
POD1000000026_S0000029	little did i know that actually he was an amazing engineer
POD1000000026_S0000031	i do not know that you have ever touched photoshop actually
POD1000000026_S0000033	actually that is not true
POD1000000026_S0000034	i built the shutter on the very 1st version of instagram and it was very basic
POD1000000026_S0000035	was not the shutter literally just 2 gray sliders that just closed and opened
POD1000000026_S0000036	that is it
POD1000000026_S0000038	that was not that was not that good honestly
POD1000000026_S0000040	but that was the 1st time i remember hanging out with you cause i remember being so impressed
POD1000000026_S0000041	and i asked you what tool you were using
POD1000000026_S0000042	and i do not remember the tool but i remember using it and just being like 0 man like
POD1000000026_S0000043	it is so good to have like a mic in your life where you can ask them a question and they just always have the best answer
POD1000000026_S0000044	and it turns out years later i still feel like that is true
POD1000000026_S0000045	i remember thinking 0 here is somebody who is actually like pursuing something that he is excited about
POD1000000026_S0000046	actually building it and like 0 a kindred spirit that is here on the weekends not just to check facebook or do something but is building
POD1000000026_S0000047	so having another builder was exciting i am like 0 somebody else cares about this stuff
POD1000000026_S0000048	i think maybe where mike and i overlap most is the fact that we both love to make things
POD1000000026_S0000049	my dream was always to build something that a lot of people used
POD1000000026_S0000050	so our friendship revolves around that
POD1000000026_S0000051	and it just so happens that that also happens to be a profession
POD1000000026_S0000052	i did know that he was working on bourbon
POD1000000026_S0000053	i think i already had maybe installed it and was playing around with it
POD1000000026_S0000054	it was a check in app that let you check in at different places
POD1000000026_S0000055	it was a way of sharing what you were up to and where you were
POD1000000026_S0000056	with the twist that you could add photos and videos to it which in 2009 was actually the only one i could find that could do that
POD1000000026_S0000057	and even though you had to jump through all these hoops to upload a photo on bourbon
POD1000000026_S0000058	people were doing it and all of a sudden it was not just this person is here but 0 that is what it looks like there
POD1000000026_S0000059	so that was to me the inkling of something interesting in verbin
POD1000000026_S0000060	i was pitching it to investors and one of the investors was like yeah here is 50 grand
POD1000000026_S0000061	you can go work on this and like take a small small stipend
POD1000000026_S0000062	but you have to get a co founder these things work best when you have a co founder
POD1000000026_S0000063	he was saying hey look at all the best companies in the world
POD1000000026_S0000064	the ones that really work are the ones where generally there is more than one solo person running the ship
POD1000000026_S0000065	google was a co founder pair
POD1000000026_S0000066	youtube was a co founder pair
POD1000000026_S0000067	the point is when you have a team you are more likely to succeed
POD1000000026_S0000068	i agreed with that i mean the pattern was clearly there the evidence was there
POD1000000026_S0000069	so i kind of went through the rolodex in my mind of like who do i know that could be a co founder
POD1000000026_S0000070	and i remember running into mike and i think the next time i ran into him i floated the idea hey like maybe we should work together on this
POD1000000026_S0000071	we basically decided we are going to prototype working together
POD1000000026_S0000072	so we would get together at a cafe near mike is house and we created a fake project
POD1000000026_S0000073	why we did not just work on bourbon i do not know but we created a fake project with a fake outcome we wanted to accomplish that night
POD1000000026_S0000074	mike would do one half of it i would do a different half of it and we would come together and we would ask questions figure out how each other worked
POD1000000026_S0000075	and we really enjoyed that experience
POD1000000026_S0000076	so you know i remember this fateful day standing at the caltrain station before mike had to go to work and .
POD1000000026_S0000077	i was like mike i really want to work together
POD1000000026_S0000078	in my head i was probably like i really want to work together and i really need this $50000 right so i need a co founder too
POD1000000026_S0000079	and i asked him this question and i just remember his response he is like count me interested
POD1000000026_S0000081	count me interested are you in or are you out
POD1000000026_S0000082	i vividly remember the moment he asked because i had one of those life flashing before your eyes but not the past the future
POD1000000026_S0000083	i was like okay i can be working with somebody who i have come to really start respecting and like want to work with
POD1000000026_S0000084	and that is where count me interested came from which to me sounded like a yes but maybe i was a little coy
POD1000000026_S0000085	but to me it was just like 0 yeah of course
POD1000000026_S0000086	i am going to ask you a question okay
POD1000000026_S0000087	i want a little bit of
POD1000000026_S0000088	understanding here
POD1000000026_S0000089	you are now married
POD1000000026_S0000090	i do not know how you proposed to your wife but when you asked her to marry you if she had come back and said count me interested
POD1000000026_S0000091	would you have been like that was a yes
POD1000000026_S0000093	that is for clarification
POD1000000026_S0000095	i look back on a lot of the major decisions in my life that i have made
POD1000000026_S0000096	this one is an easier one where i knew that it was what i wanted to do and then the next week was logistically can i do it
POD1000000026_S0000097	you know i come from brazil i was on a work visa
POD1000000026_S0000098	you were taking on so much risk because you had everything set
POD1000000026_S0000099	they give you a job you have this work visa everything
POD1000000026_S0000100	and you were jumping and like i think back how crazy we were to do that
POD1000000026_S0000101	we had to like form a company so that the government would be like okay you can have this visa
POD1000000026_S0000102	i think this is the 1st moment where i really started feeling this sort of mutual trust with kevin
POD1000000026_S0000103	because the count me interested moment was january and we applied soon afterwards
POD1000000026_S0000104	and 80 days goes by 90 days goes by
POD1000000026_S0000105	and i was like kev look i know you want to get this off the ground
POD1000000026_S0000106	it is like march it is april now like .
POD1000000026_S0000107	3 months is forever in startup land like if you want to cut this and be like i am just going to find a us co founder that can make this work i will get it
POD1000000026_S0000108	and i remember kevin was like no man like we are going to make this work
POD1000000026_S0000109	let us email the lawyer let us keep pushing forward like no we will wait we will figure this out
POD1000000026_S0000110	that meant so much to me
POD1000000026_S0000111	i mean it still does like because you could have easily been like yeah man this is too hard i need to get this going
POD1000000026_S0000112	and that would have been a rational decision to have made
POD1000000026_S0000113	but instead he was like no let us like figure this out and .
POD1000000026_S0000114	it finally came and at that point it was like alright i can actually join and actually do this stuff together
POD1000000026_S0000115	we had been working on bourbon for a while 89 months or something by that time
POD1000000026_S0000116	and we were meeting one of our early investors
POD1000000026_S0000117	and he was like so what are you building what is up like what is new
POD1000000026_S0000118	and we are like well you know we have these features and it does this thing and it does this thing
POD1000000026_S0000119	and his face was just blank
POD1000000026_S0000120	like he is just looking at us like what are you talking about i do not understand what you are trying to build
POD1000000026_S0000121	and we were so sad after that meeting because it was so clear to us that we could not explain what we were working on
POD1000000026_S0000122	so we went back to the office we sat in front of a whiteboard and we said okay we have to focus this thing
POD1000000026_S0000123	it is trying to do too much all at once
POD1000000026_S0000124	so we stripped everything away that day
POD1000000026_S0000125	and we focused just on the components that would effectively become instagram
POD1000000026_S0000126	and maybe in the course of a week or 2 made the 1st version of instagram
POD1000000026_S0000127	i spent far more time with kevin than any other human being for that 1st year of instagram easily right like we were in there every single day
POD1000000026_S0000128	12 13 14 hours sometimes overnight
POD1000000026_S0000129	you know mike would be brushing his teeth in the employee bathroom you know at 4 am just because like we had been there all night
POD1000000026_S0000130	we got to launch day we launched it to the world
POD1000000026_S0000131	october 6 2010 i know that date and the date of my daughter is birth those are the 2 dates i will never forget right
POD1000000026_S0000132	people liked it people started using it
POD1000000026_S0000133	and i was taken aback because i mean i had worked at a company before that struggled to get 10000 people to use it over a year
POD1000000026_S0000134	and we got to 25000 that 1st day
POD1000000026_S0000135	and i remember turning to mike and i said i think we have created something
POD1000000026_S0000136	i am usually the pessimist and mike is usually i am not sure optimist but you are pragmatist right
POD1000000026_S0000137	but like i had this moment of clarity that there was something special because i had never seen people react this way
POD1000000026_S0000138	and mike just looked at me like i do not know maybe not maybe this is all going to come crashing down
POD1000000026_S0000139	the one little dinky server that we had was just like metaphorically and perhaps physically melting by all the traffic that was coming at it
POD1000000026_S0000140	i really felt like we had squandered this opportunity
POD1000000026_S0000141	and i was like we should probably add another server
POD1000000026_S0000142	and kevin was like no we do not need another server
POD1000000026_S0000143	and in retrospect i think it was like we did not know if this thing was going to take off and it was expensive to add another server like did we really need it
POD1000000026_S0000144	and i was like no i think we do
POD1000000026_S0000145	and then like later he is like 0 man sorry like i was a little heated
POD1000000026_S0000146	you know we had been up for 36 hours at that point you know kind of fighting off sleep and also excited
POD1000000026_S0000148	both the best and worst days of our lives
POD1000000026_S0000149	like you know the thing was working but also was crashing
POD1000000026_S0000150	i think that was like the only time we have ever raised our voices with each other
POD1000000026_S0000151	it was brief it was like a probably 32nd interaction
POD1000000026_S0000152	i approve this message
POD1000000026_S0000154	which is true like that was the one time that it was heated and it was just the heat of the moment
POD1000000026_S0000155	i am actually going to take it way back at our 1st disagreement which actually i have not thought about in many years
POD1000000026_S0000156	2 or 3 weeks into working together i remember coming in one day and saying
POD1000000026_S0000157	what do you think of us like one or 2 days a week just working from home because i can just jam on stuff and just stay up all night and code and i will like be up till noon
POD1000000026_S0000158	and it will like i think i will work better that way and you are like
POD1000000026_S0000159	no i would really like for us to be in the same office together i think that matters a lot
POD1000000026_S0000160	and i remember being annoyed for like 10 seconds
POD1000000026_S0000162	i was like yeah okay like sure like we would give that a try
POD1000000026_S0000163	and in the end it was great we were able to jam on ideas and move really quickly
POD1000000026_S0000164	if i had to like abstract it and what i learned about working with kevin over the years it was i do not think you are ever a person that will just agree to something because it will make somebody else happy
POD1000000026_S0000165	but you also make sure that in disagreeing you are also not being a jerk and making them feel bad about feeling differently you are like
POD1000000026_S0000166	now i have thought about this and here is what i want to do for it
POD1000000026_S0000167	is there like a reason why you really feel differently and then we can have the conversation
POD1000000026_S0000168	that sort of like detoxified ability to disagree is really important
POD1000000026_S0000169	i get annoyed really easily
POD1000000026_S0000170	but the interesting thing is mike does not annoy me like he really does not
POD1000000026_S0000171	like i really do not get annoyed with mike because he has character and integrity
POD1000000026_S0000172	those are the 2 things i care about
POD1000000026_S0000173	like if you are just a generally good person and when you say you are going to do something you do it
POD1000000026_S0000174	who cares if mike chose the wrong x y or z to solve a problem or maybe introduced a bug or what i do not care
POD1000000026_S0000175	mike has never made except for that one time on the server issue mike has never made me angry
POD1000000026_S0000176	i do not think we ever actually had titles for the longest time
POD1000000026_S0000177	i guess once we started doing public events and we had to talk about what our titles were
POD1000000026_S0000178	there was a time where we were like okay you are cto i am ceo we kind of like divided it that way
POD1000000026_S0000179	but you always say co founder 1st that is the title
POD1000000026_S0000180	when i thought about my identity and what we were doing in the company i was like co founder maybe technical co founder if you wanted to put an adjective in front of it
POD1000000026_S0000181	required technical co founders
POD1000000026_S0000184	but i do also think the speakstar personality and our relationship it is really important for any company to ultimately have one final decision maker
POD1000000026_S0000185	i have seen so many companies not have one and it become a mess sometimes there is a tie break needed or sometimes like a call needs to get made
POD1000000026_S0000186	you really need to find somebody who is willing to like make that call and you all have to be ready to like make that person successful in that role or else it is just not going to work
POD1000000026_S0000187	we had a bunch of people that really wanted instagram inside of their company
POD1000000026_S0000188	but we were having so much fun doing our own thing that we just did not want to be part of any other company
POD1000000026_S0000189	we did not want to be a wing of a building we wanted to be the building
POD1000000026_S0000190	and i remember you turned to me at one and you are like i really do not think we should pursue any of these
POD1000000026_S0000191	like i think we are better off independent but if you feel differently like let me know like let us have that conversation
POD1000000026_S0000192	which was helpful because it made me reflect and be like no no this is really fun
POD1000000026_S0000193	like i am working with somebody i deeply respect we are starting to build a team it is working
POD1000000026_S0000194	yeah let us like let us keep doing this thing we still got money in the bank
POD1000000026_S0000195	so you know for the longest time we were just like we are going to do this thing ourselves
POD1000000026_S0000196	and the only time we literally had like a number to face was the facebook offer
POD1000000026_S0000197	when we were like 0 a $10 just sounds funny to say right like
POD1000000026_S0000198	it is a 10 you think of like doctor evil in one of these movies right
POD1000000026_S0000199	but someone comes along and offers you a $10 for something you have been working on for i do not know all of a year publicly and then you have got 11 employees and you are just like man i would like how do you even do that calculus
POD1000000026_S0000200	what do you say to that
POD1000000026_S0000201	i really remember being in sort of like a daze it is like everything was just very strange
POD1000000026_S0000202	we had a long conversation about what we wanted to do
POD1000000026_S0000203	at the end of the day the thing that mattered the most to us was that they wanted us to keep running it independently like we had been doing
POD1000000026_S0000204	they were like no instagram is a thing
POD1000000026_S0000205	your community you guys have effectively a team and a company and a culture
POD1000000026_S0000206	keep doing that
POD1000000026_S0000207	and we stayed 6 years
POD1000000026_S0000208	there was a lot of like hey checking in how are you feeling what do you want to do
POD1000000026_S0000209	we only wanted to be at instagram if the other person was at instagram
POD1000000026_S0000210	every january i would decide i wanted to consciously recommit to still being there
POD1000000026_S0000211	make it an intentional choice
POD1000000026_S0000212	like i come around in january and i say is this still what i want to be learning
POD1000000026_S0000213	i vowed to myself it is funny the vows you make to yourself when you are 18 years old
POD1000000026_S0000214	i vowed to myself when i was 18 i wanted to have a life full of unique years not the same year over and over again
POD1000000026_S0000215	like that was my biggest fear
POD1000000026_S0000216	and i looked and i was like i feel like we have done incredibly hard things
POD1000000026_S0000217	i have learned a ton but it feels like we are on some like diminishing returns curve of learning
POD1000000026_S0000218	and i remember i had dinner with kevin i was like hey man i feel like it might be time for me to try something different which is like a hard conversation like it is a scary conversation to have
POD1000000026_S0000219	i remember kevin turned to me and said like i get where you are coming from
POD1000000026_S0000220	is there anything that you think would still feel like a new interesting thing
POD1000000026_S0000221	and i listed a couple of things
POD1000000026_S0000222	and then i had the interesting experience of kind of doing part of kevin is job for a few months because he went out on paternity leave
POD1000000026_S0000223	and he was out and he said mike i am on paternity leave i really want to be present with my kid
POD1000000026_S0000224	can you make sure things go well while i am away
POD1000000026_S0000225	and it was interesting because in my head i always had this question like is the one thing that would make me stay like to have this very different experience of being ceo rather than cto
POD1000000026_S0000226	and i got to have that experience for like 2 months
POD1000000026_S0000227	i remember kevin hitting back i was like kevin i do not want your job at all
POD1000000026_S0000228	and like we would always joke that one of the reasons we work together is that we did not want each other is jobs
POD1000000026_S0000229	and at some point it felt like a thing i would always said and i wanted to make sure it was actually really true
POD1000000026_S0000230	but i remember at the end of the experience being like no i am really glad i got to try it because made me realize like where my happy spot is is not in that role
POD1000000026_S0000231	in the role i was in and in that role i feel like i have accomplished what i want to accomplish
POD1000000026_S0000232	and i wanted something hard
POD1000000026_S0000233	and i wanted to be bad at something again
POD1000000026_S0000234	maybe will not be as big as instagram maybe one
POD1000000026_S0000235	probably will not be as big as instagram let us be honest
POD1000000026_S0000236	but maybe it will be just as fun to learn along the way
POD1000000026_S0000237	that is ultimately what made me want to jump
POD1000000026_S0000238	but we had no idea what we were going to do
POD1000000026_S0000239	the 1st thing was rest and recovery
POD1000000026_S0000240	we were kind of off doing our own thing we wanted to just chill out and disconnect a little bit but we reconnected and it was like yeah what do you miss the most
POD1000000026_S0000241	it is like well i miss hanging out of course and you say those nice things to each other but i miss building stuff
POD1000000026_S0000242	i learned a big lesson i think in the middle months before we really reconnected which was i think i am holding this idea of kevin in my head of like
POD1000000026_S0000243	i bet he is like already thought of like what is next and like he has not told me about it
POD1000000026_S0000244	and i realized like
POD1000000026_S0000245	0 no
POD1000000026_S0000246	i created this thing of like 0 we have not talked in a few months
POD1000000026_S0000247	and if you think about it i have never actually thought about this but like that was the longest we went without really talking in 9 years
POD1000000026_S0000248	so like
POD1000000026_S0000250	i was like man like we have not talked which must mean that like he does not want to talk to me
POD1000000026_S0000251	and i remember having this phone call that was so like what a relief like we talked on the phone you are like yeah like i am where you are
POD1000000026_S0000252	like i have not thought of what is next and i would love to work with you and i was like i would love to like love to keep working with you too
POD1000000026_S0000253	to me the lesson learned was like if you have like a very close relationship with somebody and then you just do not talk to them for a few months like
POD1000000026_S0000254	your brain is going to start assuming that that silence means something that it absolutely does not
POD1000000026_S0000255	and it just meant that we just needed some time to clear our heads and have our own thing
POD1000000026_S0000256	and once he talked i was like 0 ok great he feels the same way i do which is like we do not know exactly what it is yet but we want to do it with each other
POD1000000026_S0000257	and that was a real like relief for me i was like great we are on the same page and now we can just spend the time to explore and figure out what we are excited to build next
POD1000000026_S0000258	both of us wanted to do something together again
POD1000000026_S0000259	like that was rare like most co founder pairs find themselves in some sort of fight along the way and break up and
POD1000000026_S0000260	the idea that we could have a new challenge together potentially i think was what made it way more exciting
POD1000000026_S0000261	i am not sure we were like looking for personal relationship when we started like a friendship
POD1000000026_S0000262	but the bond we have now is
POD1000000026_S0000264	i think i would liken to people who like were in the military together
POD1000000026_S0000265	and i am not saying we did anything even close to as important as that but when you go through things with someone when people try to kill your company when people try to throw you under the bus
POD1000000026_S0000266	all this stuff has happened to us and then some
POD1000000026_S0000267	and i remember very specifically this moment we were having a disagreement with an investor
POD1000000026_S0000268	and we were so stressed out and we went to this really terrible taqueria on market street
POD1000000026_S0000269	but we sat down and we both ordered like the greasiest thing we could possibly imagine
POD1000000026_S0000270	and honestly that might have been a low in the company but it was a high for me
POD1000000026_S0000271	like i look back on that moment really fondly because it was us against the world
POD1000000026_S0000272	it was like we are going to win this thing even if people do not believe in us even if we are having this thing go on like we are going to make this work
POD1000000026_S0000273	call it friendship but that is like a bond that you do not form hanging out
POD1000000026_S0000274	the fact that we still like each other this long i think speaks to like a deeper trust and like real bond
POD1000000026_S0000275	but i think the fact that we liked each other after that 1st year which is like pure exposure spoke to trust but i think also just to
POD1000000026_S0000276	we have a way about each other that is not one that we find annoying
POD1000000026_S0000277	which sounds trivial but actually when you are that around somebody for that long for that many days
POD1000000026_S0000278	you have not showered in 3 days sometimes and you are eating the same lunch you have eaten every single day like
POD1000000026_S0000279	it is actually really important and hard to screen for in a couple of nights at a coffee shop prototyping
POD1000000026_S0000280	i think in that was a regard where we probably got lucky
POD1000000026_S0000281	could have said it better that is exactly it

POD1000000028_S0000030	this is heavy metals from 30 for 30 podcast i am alyssa roenick gymnastics has been part of my life in some form for as long as i can remember from watching mary lou on tv at the 1984 olympics when i was 7 to later being a teenage gymnast obsessing over kim zemeskul is tumbling passes
POD1000000028_S0000031	and for the past 15 years at espn where my reporting partner bonnie ford and i both cover international sports
POD1000000028_S0000032	when i covered my 1st summer olympic games in beijing in 2008 china was accused of having an underage gymnast on the team and i was writing about it i will never forget bella caroli shouting into my digital recorder about how the chinese coaches had just stolen his playbook
POD1000000028_S0000033	i wish i still had that tape here was bela karolyi not just upset that china had possibly broken the rules but wanting to make sure i knew he deserved credit for recognizing that younger and smaller gymnasts had better chances for gold it was a point he had been making to reporters for years
POD1000000028_S0000035	as the truth has come to light about the consequences of pinning a nation is hopes on the shoulders of children bella and marta caroli have come under scrutiny
POD1000000028_S0000036	today breaking news allegations that strike at the heart of a very successful u s olympic sport
POD1000000028_S0000037	one of the worst things we have seen in us olympic history
POD1000000028_S0000038	their legacy is littered with questions about what they accomplished and how much responsibility they bear for the incredible amount of damage that has been done
POD1000000028_S0000039	claims tonight from a former gymnast who has filed suit against a doctor and legendary coaches bella and marta caroli
POD1000000028_S0000040	yes this unnamed gymnast accuses the carolles of turning a blind eye to abuse
POD1000000028_S0000041	but as complicated as their story would become it all started with something simple
POD1000000028_S0000043	it started with perfection
POD1000000028_S0000045	at the 1976 olympic games in montreal 14 year old nadia comaneci earned the 1st perfect 10 in olympic gymnastics history
POD1000000028_S0000046	and when the judges announced her score the crowd erupted but no one more so than nadia is coach bella caroli
POD1000000028_S0000047	at 33 years old bella and marta caroli were just beginning their career as coaches outside of romania they were unknowns but bella was impossible to miss
POD1000000028_S0000048	especially as the 6 foot plus coach towered over his 4 foot 11 £86 protege
POD1000000028_S0000050	over the course of a single thrilling week nadia became the crowd favorite and an international star as she scored perfect 10 after perfect 10
POD1000000028_S0000052	an unbelievable 7 perfect 10s all together and in the individual all around nadia won the gold medal a 1st for romania
POD1000000028_S0000053	finally nadia comes up and does her incredible routine that is where the crowd exploded i mean that was explosion explosion of support explosion of love and excitement and i am looking through the corner of my eyes
POD1000000028_S0000054	and i see the soviet team getting their stuff and they walk in out of the arena i said yes yes we got it
POD1000000028_S0000055	finally after decades of dominance a romanian had beaten the soviets
POD1000000028_S0000056	in a way for some people this is the end of a love affair the dethroning of the ussr gymnastic competition nadia komanecha now takes over 14 year old sprite of a girl
POD1000000028_S0000057	but for bela karolyi and his wife and coaching partner marta there was something even greater at stake the favor of the romanian government
POD1000000028_S0000060	it was late night romanian time so i was watching before tim doctor and his wife marta is friend and my wife we watched on black and white tv
POD1000000028_S0000062	my name is geza pozsar that is the hungarian pronunciation in english it is like geza pozsar so geza pozsar
POD1000000028_S0000063	geza pozar was the choreographer for the romanian national team
POD1000000028_S0000064	he had been working with bela and marta for years he designed nadia is floor routine and helped her train for this moment but instead of watching from the sidelines with bela and marta he was watching from home because the romanian government would not let him travel to montreal
POD1000000028_S0000065	because i did not get the visa to go
POD1000000028_S0000066	geza had recently married a french woman and so the government did not trust him to go to canada and actually return to romania
POD1000000028_S0000068	from his living room in the small town of onest gheza like the rest of romania watch nadia make history
POD1000000028_S0000070	the whole town came out to the streets it was like midnight all of them they come out and it was like carnival in rio you know it was unbelievable 1st of all they get drunk you know that is the 1st thing but everyone is so happy
POD1000000028_S0000071	and that is a huge celebration huge
POD1000000028_S0000072	but this moment was bigger than just the party in those small town streets
POD1000000028_S0000073	the whole world is in ecstasy you know
POD1000000028_S0000074	the whole world was in ecstasy that is why nadia is perfect 10s and her gold medal were so important they made romania visible a country that suddenly stood out from the rest of the communist bloc
POD1000000028_S0000075	nadia was a lovable figure from a place the western world saw as very grim
POD1000000028_S0000076	nadia was the diamond she was the treasure of romania it was the best product romania ever had nadia put romania on the map after nadia everybody knows that there is romania
POD1000000028_S0000078	during the cold war sports were a way for nations to assert their power without going to war olympic success equaled national pride for athletes and coaches in romania it meant security and stature it meant not waiting in line for a loaf of bread
POD1000000028_S0000079	people suffer shortages
POD1000000028_S0000080	brought about despotism and corruption of the imperial government
POD1000000028_S0000081	romania at that time was under a very very strict ugly dictatorship and it was a cult of personality
POD1000000028_S0000082	a public display of giant portraits of communist leaders
POD1000000028_S0000083	we had to idolize the leader of the country
POD1000000028_S0000084	nadia is win was the ultimate political validation for the country is leader nikolai ceausescu
POD1000000028_S0000085	paganci was befitting the crowning of a princess
POD1000000028_S0000086	it was a national celebration and the president got very excited
POD1000000028_S0000087	this presentation was made personally by the president of romania nicolae ceausescu
POD1000000028_S0000089	nadia and the corolis were welcomed home to romania as heroes
POD1000000028_S0000090	they gave us awards you know we got some bonuses we paid only half of the taxes like everybody paid we got 50% deduction on our taxes
POD1000000028_S0000091	propaganda is power in a regime like ceausescu is and there was no better propaganda than celebrating and rewarding the success of its olympic champion and the coaches who had brought romania such high honor
POD1000000028_S0000092	nadia was made hero of the socialist country and she was a hero well decorated
POD1000000028_S0000093	a country honored nadia with its highest award the hero of the socialist labor
POD1000000028_S0000094	she got the call bella got 2 calls
POD1000000028_S0000095	nadia and the corolis were gifted cars their taxes were cut in half as the rest of the country dealt with crushing rations the romanian coaches and their choreographer had meals delivered to them for free
POD1000000028_S0000096	the days of waiting in food lines were over for them
POD1000000028_S0000097	the only thing what they expected us to do is to win medals
POD1000000028_S0000098	as long as they could keep making romania proud
POD1000000028_S0000100	bella caroli had always been an athlete but never a gymnast
POD1000000028_S0000101	he was a boxer in the beginning then he became a hammer thrower then he became a handball coach so everything about gymnastics
POD1000000028_S0000102	bella is 1st experience with gymnastics did not come until college
POD1000000028_S0000103	i had to pass some gymnastic test which was all difficult to me i was a tall and pretty heavy guy
POD1000000028_S0000104	it was something something to see me swinging on the bars and doing a tumbling which is an unknown sport for me totally unknown before
POD1000000028_S0000105	he was introduced to gymnastics and to one of his classmates marta eros the woman he would marry
POD1000000028_S0000106	i got married and my wife a former gymnast she was a good gymnast though we got married and we went out to teach gymnastics
POD1000000028_S0000107	marta and bella both majored in physical education with the goal of coaching young kids they wanted to work together and decided to focus on her specialty gymnastics
POD1000000028_S0000108	it was a new experience a totally new experience for me i never had the experience to teach young children i did not know how to start with them
POD1000000028_S0000109	bella came to the sport not knowing much about gymnastics but that did not really matter because he was essentially teaching himself the basics of the sport by teaching little kids who did not know much about gymnastics themselves
POD1000000028_S0000110	that is something geza noticed the 1st time he saw bella in action
POD1000000028_S0000111	i saw this big guy big guy all dressed in a blue warm up and some very small little kids who were up almost just up to his hips you know
POD1000000028_S0000112	flipping like the little fishes in the water like little silver fishes tumbling on the floor so it was very impressive and i saw this guy with huge hands sometimes spouting them and throwing them up in there and catching them
POD1000000028_S0000113	0 my god i think this is something different
POD1000000028_S0000114	it was kind of an ideal match giant bella could easily spot these small kids and help them safely learn new skills his wife marta had the gymnastics know how and credibility
POD1000000028_S0000115	they started to teach very young kids very hard tricks easy to spot them you know
POD1000000028_S0000116	the karolis refined their system in local gymnasiums for 10 years before breaking on to the national stage
POD1000000028_S0000117	after that he got in connection with the gymnastic federation we got lots of help from them
POD1000000028_S0000118	bella and marta is approach got results nearly all of the athletes on the romanian olympic team that won the silver medal in 1976 had trained with the corollis
POD1000000028_S0000119	as a group they were noticeably younger and tinier than the gymnasts who had come before them
POD1000000028_S0000120	14 year old nadia comaneci of romania 4 feet 11 £86
POD1000000028_S0000121	by comparison the 1972 olympic gold medalist was a 19 year old the 1968 gold medalist was 26 they had been through puberty they were taller they had women is bodies
POD1000000028_S0000122	when nadia won gold at 14 years old it sealed the trend toward child athlete
POD1000000028_S0000123	the youngest ever to win a gold medal in the all around competition
POD1000000028_S0000124	nadia congratulations again and one thing i wanted to ask her she is the youngest girl to win a gold medal at the olympic games where does she go from here what about 1980

POD1000000028_S0000131	congratulations and to your coach bella caroli
POD1000000028_S0000132	before the 1976 games were even over the romanians were focused on repeating and adding to that success and because bela was seen as responsible for nadia
POD1000000028_S0000133	the romanian government put the karolyi is in charge of a new national training center in the small industrial town of deva
POD1000000028_S0000134	bela always liked to work in this type of small places when he had a lot of control
POD1000000028_S0000135	it was isolated that was the point bella liked to keep tabs on the girls
POD1000000028_S0000136	so he knew if the girls went to buy some ice cream or he knew because he knew everybody so the girls were under control at the time he cannot go there and buy food or something without him knowing
POD1000000028_S0000137	geza had moved to deva with bella and marta to continue as the team is choreographer and dance coach they were working at the pinnacle of romania is centralized system
POD1000000028_S0000138	and there was tremendous pressure to find more nadia is

POD1000000028_S0000145	i saw nadia on tv and i loved gymnastics and i always told my mom 0 my gosh i wish i could train with her but that is never going to happen and then we get a phone call and i was like i said okay mom let us go
POD1000000028_S0000146	trudy traveled with her mother by train to deva
POD1000000028_S0000147	i was so happy when we got there and i saw bella he looked to me like a mountain i was a little tiny girl and he was like big and all smiling and everything
POD1000000028_S0000148	her mother kissed her and placed a half a loaf of bread in a dresser drawer before leaving she told her daughter to please remember to eat
POD1000000028_S0000149	she said okay honey i need to leave now i need to catch the train i said bye mom i gave her a kiss and then bella showed her to the through the hallway to the door
POD1000000028_S0000150	and i was just like 0 okay by myself in a room i said okay so where should i put my stuff and the door just suddenly opens in a scary way you know just really fast
POD1000000028_S0000151	and bella comes and he smacked me over the face so hard that it flew on my bed and he opened the drawer where my bread was in and he said if i ever see you again eating anything like this i will kill you
POD1000000028_S0000152	that was my welcome
POD1000000028_S0000154	do not misunderstand the national training center at a drab town called dava is not a concentration camp there are pillow fights and fun and going to school but there is mostly training
POD1000000028_S0000155	tough training it is this was nadia in her training days with coach karolyi standing by but not catching her is this training or torture and what do the youngsters think about it
POD1000000028_S0000156	we fail to watch all the time
POD1000000028_S0000157	gabby jaikulescu was 13 years old when she was recruited to train with trudy and the other olympians in the making
POD1000000028_S0000158	life in deva was one of deprivation beatings and living in constant fear
POD1000000028_S0000159	i tell you what i saw when i got there you know 2 little crackers in the morning it was a little food but it was not enough
POD1000000028_S0000160	i mean i ate toothpaste because i was not able to sleep i was so hungry and i just felt that i need something in my stomach
POD1000000028_S0000161	we were eating leftovers on the street if you find a little apple that was like half eaten then you would pick it up
POD1000000028_S0000162	you fall asleep dreaming about chocolates floating in front of your eyes you fall asleep seeing like fried chicken
POD1000000028_S0000163	especially when you go and the coaches eat to a table next to you and they get like fried chicken and french fries and they eat right next to us and we sit there we have
POD1000000028_S0000164	plain yogurt and a boiled egg or you have a dry piece of meat that gets stuck in your throat it is so dry
POD1000000028_S0000165	i mean you go to sleep hungry and with all that training you know training training training and we were given a fist of vitamins or who knows what was that
POD1000000028_S0000166	and we never knew what is going to happen next and there were times where 110 clock at night came and billa came to the dorm and said put your shoes on and let us go start running outside you fat ass pigs
POD1000000028_S0000168	go run rain shine snowing
POD1000000028_S0000169	there was no patience or compassion for injuries at bella is training center
POD1000000028_S0000170	he wanted everything fast quick you know put them back together fast you know if the doctor did not follow bela is orders you know they are out
POD1000000028_S0000171	bella fired doctors who did not follow his orders and the gymnasts knew that complaining about injuries could lead to a beating
POD1000000028_S0000172	one day doing a vault at practice gabby landed awkwardly and broke 2 fingers she walked back to her teammates and showed them her throbbing right hand
POD1000000028_S0000173	and they told me shut up do not say anything because he is going to get so mad and i had to finish that practice with 2 broken fingers
POD1000000028_S0000174	i remember trying to grab the bar with one of the hands i could have put 2 fingers down and somehow he just got kind of sick of looking at me not doing a good job
POD1000000028_S0000175	he said a few words you know and just dismissed me nobody is going to take me to take an x ray not have a doctor to look at this
POD1000000028_S0000176	and all what i hear from colleagues is just keep going
POD1000000028_S0000177	everything about the gymnast is lives in dava was monitored the national team coaches listened to their phone calls and intercepted their mail
POD1000000028_S0000178	when homesick girls ran away from the training center police took them back to deva
POD1000000028_S0000179	i was so scared i swear i thought he has eyes on the trees on the bushes on the walls
POD1000000028_S0000180	we could not quit it was not a choice and you had to keep going against your will against everything
POD1000000028_S0000181	bella maintained complete control while marta came into the gym mostly to coach balance beam
POD1000000028_S0000182	to me it always seemed like he was always on top of everything and she was doing whatever he wanted her to do and obeying everything
POD1000000028_S0000183	when marta was in the gym she could also be physically abusive
POD1000000028_S0000184	and we could actually defend ourselves from her because she was not strong enough to catch us and hit us
POD1000000028_S0000185	so you know sometimes she would scratch us and she would grab us from the neck like this and then she would pour her fingernails into your meat and it kind of hurt but she was not good at beating
POD1000000028_S0000186	bella was the bad 10 gosh that was bad
POD1000000028_S0000187	and when they faltered at meats they faced his wrath
POD1000000028_S0000188	let us say you fell on beam that was a disaster you got off the beam saluted the judges and we went straight to the bathroom and he came after us and we got beaten up
POD1000000028_S0000190	and then he said well you better put yourself together because you have 2 more events
POD1000000028_S0000191	the girls only respite from bella and marta was their dance classes with geza
POD1000000028_S0000192	you know it was relaxing for us it was fun he could make us you know smile and have a good time
POD1000000028_S0000193	they also knew he would look out for them
POD1000000028_S0000194	geza was always the one that was always behind bella is back he was protecting us
POD1000000028_S0000195	when he was together with bella and marta he was a tough guy because he had to look like a tough guy because he would have probably lost his job if he did not
POD1000000028_S0000196	so every time we went to practice at the gym in the afternoon and geza was there before and he was always at the door looking through the keyhole and when bella marked he said 666 and 55 was marked and 6 was bella
POD1000000028_S0000197	geza used dance counts as code names for marta and bella
POD1000000028_S0000198	that is how we knew when he said 6 we already were like 0 my gosh bella is coming
POD1000000028_S0000199	some days bella disappeared from the gym to go hunting
POD1000000028_S0000200	those are the best days of our lives in the gym so basically dracula was not there
POD1000000028_S0000201	who was dracula
POD1000000028_S0000202	0 bella
POD1000000028_S0000204	bella and marta faced enormous pressure going into the 1980 olympics their standing with the government was only as good as their next result
POD1000000028_S0000205	they would have to match or beat the success of the 76 games to keep their country is favor
POD1000000028_S0000206	the entire romanian team felt the weight of their country is oppressive regime when they met with officials before they left for moscow
POD1000000028_S0000207	some kind of lieutenant i do not know he was all dressed in green and stuff big guy and really serious and he said you better think what you are doing twice do not you ever bring shame on your country you are weighing our country on your shoulders
POD1000000028_S0000208	trying to defend her gold medal in the all around nadia became the center of a judging dispute
POD1000000028_S0000210	nadia went on a beam and her beam score did not come up
POD1000000028_S0000212	bella protested nadia is low beam score in full view of the television cameras
POD1000000028_S0000214	nadia had to settle for silver in the all around but went on to win gold on floor and beam trudy won a silver medal on the uneven bars
POD1000000028_S0000215	the romanians repeated with a silver in the team competition but this time finishing 2nd to the russians was a disappointment bela and marta were not returning to romania as heroes again
POD1000000028_S0000216	so when we made a big brouhaha about nadia is calling on me the government did not like it
POD1000000028_S0000217	in a society hyper sensitive about how it was perceived on the world stage and particularly by its communist allies bela is protest in response to the russian judge embarrassed the romanian officials
POD1000000028_S0000218	plus his most important ally in the ceausescu regime
POD1000000028_S0000219	had just been demoted
POD1000000028_S0000220	so bela knew that the end is close he told me at that moment we are in big trouble and from there everything started to go sour for us
POD1000000028_S0000222	the 1st time i ever saw bela karolyi in action with his gymnasts was pretty memorable
POD1000000028_S0000224	it was the nadia 81 tour when bella and the romanian women is national team toured with the american team in march 1981
POD1000000028_S0000225	my reporting partner bonnie ford covered the detroit stop of the nadia 81 tour a 7 city promotional tour of the u s featuring the romanian national team and its superstar
POD1000000028_S0000226	so i personally as both an olympic fan and a reporter at that time i did not think of it as a political event where the romanians were showing off their system so to speak
POD1000000028_S0000227	certainly they did they saw it as a propaganda tool and a chance to highlight their excellence
POD1000000028_S0000229	but to me it was just a chance to see the best athlete in her sport
POD1000000028_S0000231	i was focused on nadia the audience was focused on nadia a lot of very excited young girls this was like beatlemania nadia mania was definitely a real thing
POD1000000028_S0000233	bella corolli was very visible and he was unmistakable on the floor huge guy he was in our eyes the guru the genius behind nadia is precision and perfection
POD1000000028_S0000234	being on tour with bella as the romanians coach it was interesting to watch him and the gymnast really just how they interacted with each other
POD1000000028_S0000235	the u s national team had been invited to perform with the romanians on their tour tracy talavera was a member of that team
POD1000000028_S0000236	the gymnasts were always very stern very robotic they worked extremely hard they did numbers of routines and skills way beyond what we had ever seen
POD1000000028_S0000237	mike jackie the man who would become the president of the us gymnastics federation was on the tour working for one of the equipment sponsors he had a front row seat to the carollis
POD1000000028_S0000238	marta was in the background she did not say anything bella instructed her like he instructed everybody else she was very subservient i mean it was not a coaching duel
POD1000000028_S0000239	he was definitely the coach and she was definitely the 3rd assistant even though there was not a 1st or 2nd assistant
POD1000000028_S0000240	but despite how well the tour was going things behind the scenes were deteriorating for the romanian coaches
POD1000000028_S0000241	they could tell from the way officials were treating them that they were in danger of losing their jobs and their prestige
POD1000000028_S0000242	we went there and we were treated very poorly from the very beginning of the tour i mean the president of the gymnastics federation gave us a cold shoulder
POD1000000028_S0000243	on the washington d c stop they were invited to a dinner party hosted by the romanian ambassador
POD1000000028_S0000244	and at the dinner party nobody would talk to us they look at us like strangers like not even part of the team i think they had a feeling that something was going on
POD1000000028_S0000245	bela said that i do not know if we have any future back in romania
POD1000000028_S0000246	the tour was almost over in 2 days they would be headed home the karolis and geza knew things could only get worse for them that their favor with a fickle and punitive government was waning
POD1000000028_S0000247	they were tired of the scrutiny in romania everyone was watched all the time bela had fantasized about what a life in the united states could be
POD1000000028_S0000248	they had to make a decision
POD1000000028_S0000249	we made a plan
POD1000000028_S0000250	after the final show the team returned to new york before traveling back to romania but the coaches had no intention of getting on that plane
POD1000000028_S0000251	marta had an aunt with a place in manhattan that they could use to hide out for a few days in order to get there geza would have to distract his roommate the head of the romanian security detail
POD1000000028_S0000252	the plan was that i will take the secret service guy out to shopping and then we meet at the apartment
POD1000000028_S0000254	the morning of march 30 1981 trudy and her teammates were told they could go shopping as long as they were back in time to board a bus to jfk airport at noon
POD1000000028_S0000255	so we had a little bit of money and we met down in the hallway and they said okay so you have 2 hours no funny business no chocolates no eating no nothing
POD1000000028_S0000256	then we all went out the door probably i walked like 10 steps and bella says trudy
POD1000000028_S0000257	i needed to come back i started crying i said 0 my gosh what have i done wrong this time he said you are going to have to come back with us in our room i started crying because i thought i mean just the fear of what have i done wrong
POD1000000028_S0000258	trudy followed bella is orders and went back to their room with marta
POD1000000028_S0000259	i go back with marta to the hotel room and very unusual behavior she went looked out the window went walked back to the door looked to the window walked back to the door and i thought to myself what in the world gosh am i now i am supposed to be waiting to get beaten up
POD1000000028_S0000260	and i think we waited a good half an hour and then he comes through the door with a this kind of look on his face like he was all pale and stuff like that he says judy we are not coming back anymore
POD1000000028_S0000261	when i heard that i asked what that is the 1st time that i talked i said what he said well we decided that we are going to stay here we are not coming back
POD1000000028_S0000262	bella and marta asked trudy to bring back luggage for their families
POD1000000028_S0000263	and then they just told me said we just have one request please make sure that we are going to leave this room you do not leave this room for about 10 minutes after we are out of this room
POD1000000028_S0000264	and you cannot tell anybody anything until you get on the plane they left and i looked out of the windows and i saw them throwing their luggage into a taxi they jumped to a taxi and left
POD1000000028_S0000265	and that is when i knew for sure i said 0 we really we really got rid of the dracula we are not going to get beaten ever again life is going to be good from now on
POD1000000028_S0000266	meanwhile geza got his security guard roommate out of the hotel and into the crowded streets of times square for their own shopping trip
POD1000000028_S0000267	it is a big sale i said big sale i think we had a feeling that something was going on we had some plans he would not let me go and suddenly he sees a little store with umbrellas
POD1000000028_S0000268	faisa had his opportunity
POD1000000028_S0000269	i saw a cab stopping down the street i jumped to the cab and i was gone
POD1000000028_S0000270	geza made his way to meet bella and marta at her aunt is apartment
POD1000000028_S0000271	and when they saw me they jumped up and down and i made it we were very happy
POD1000000028_S0000272	after trudy saw the karolis leave she went out and found her teammates on their shopping expedition and loaded up on chocolates
POD1000000028_S0000273	i did i got chocolates and i ate even i ate chocolates right when i bought it it was the time of my life
POD1000000028_S0000274	there was no one to stop her at noon as planned the romanian national team boarded a bus to the airport
POD1000000028_S0000275	so we finally got on a bus and the security guy who was already green on his face he was all green he said where is bella you know it i said i do not know how should i know maybe they did not come back from the store yet i have no idea
POD1000000028_S0000276	there was no sign of bella marta or geza
POD1000000028_S0000277	and so the bus left we got to the airport no bella we got to the plane no bella
POD1000000028_S0000278	the plane waited 3 hours on the tarmac
POD1000000028_S0000279	i could not believe it to myself i could not believe it until the plane took off and i saw they are not in the plane i said okay now they can not come anymore
POD1000000028_S0000280	it has been some time since the united states has had a really top drawer defection from the communist bloc of nations but overnight here in washington a triple defection by 3 romanians became known which has overjoyed the american athletic world

POD1000000030_S0000006	we got a hold of ian hunter professor of exercise science at brigham young university as he was with some athletes training at byu is indoor track he told us the shoes work by combining foam in the sole with a carbon fiber plate
POD1000000030_S0000007	i think the plate mostly allows for some structure of the shoes
POD1000000030_S0000008	so if that plate was not there and you have a 44 millimeter height off the ground that is just foam and you try running around a corner it is just going to collapse on you

POD1000000030_S0000011	mainly give structure to the shoe but it does give a small benefit in terms of energy cost
POD1000000030_S0000012	combine that with now you can do higher foam because you can hold everything together with the plate
POD1000000030_S0000013	and you have got a really good pushing into the ground big displacement of the foot while it interacts with the ground and then pushes off really effectively
POD1000000030_S0000014	so it quite literally puts a spring in your step
POD1000000030_S0000015	yeah it is not a coiled spring like we are used to but any foam is really a spring this one is just really effective at it
POD1000000030_S0000016	but where is the line that is what the question is now and i think these are either at the line where i would feel comfortable or a little bit beyond
POD1000000030_S0000017	so you are saying that there could still be some innovation allowed in shoes we are not going to say everybody must wear the same type of shoe but there must be a limit to it
POD1000000030_S0000018	yeah i think it is wonderful to have the innovation and what nike is done is propelled other companies to catch up and they will catch up
POD1000000030_S0000019	so we could have the standard for marathoning or road racing is a shoe like the vaporfly but then nike or someone will go a little further with it
POD1000000030_S0000020	and we will end up with like 60 millimeter foam and enough carbon fiber to hold the structure of it so you are not collapsing but it will just continue on
POD1000000030_S0000021	and at some point the rules need to just standardize here is what a shoe is
POD1000000030_S0000022	the price of these shoes to us amateurs out there seems incredibly high is it sort of what you would expect for a top of the line running shoe
POD1000000030_S0000023	yeah when i say $250 for a pair of shoes the nike has mentioned probably will last you about 90 miles before it is losing some of its effectiveness
POD1000000030_S0000024	that is getting to the point of not outrageous but people are going to be restricted by the cost of it and they will be looking for cheaper options
POD1000000030_S0000025	if new balance alcony others start competing with the same quality and performance of shoe and are charging $150 nike is going to have to start dropping their cost down
POD1000000030_S0000026	so it is just the natural how marketing works and it will all come to an equilibrium over time
POD1000000030_S0000027	i remember reading about the advantages that some forms of artificial legs could give runners potentially over runners with like natural born legs i mean are we just reaching a point where kind of sport is hard engineering
POD1000000030_S0000028	it is and i think it should be but there have to be some restrictions to how far you go
POD1000000030_S0000029	we do not want people to be tempted to amputate their lower legs so they can go from a 215 marathoner to a 205 marathoner
POD1000000030_S0000030	our legs are not built just for running they are built for climbing and swimming and jumping and all kinds of activities
POD1000000030_S0000031	so if you tune the leg to be tuned just for running they will be great at running but not good at other things
POD1000000030_S0000032	and that is where you could go if you did not have rules established
POD1000000030_S0000033	given that these shoes do kind of have a limited life do athletes train in them and actually run in them in races or do you sort of hold them off for that performance boost when you really need it
POD1000000030_S0000034	well if they are sponsored by nike they will do all of their race pace work in those shoes
POD1000000030_S0000035	but if they are buying their own shoes what i typically see is they buy the pair do maybe 2 workouts in them before the race so they probably have about 15 to 20 miles on them and then they do the race
POD1000000030_S0000036	and then they will maybe work out in those ones but buy a new pair before the next race they do
POD1000000030_S0000037	and that is if it is someone that cares about saving a couple minutes on a marathon time
POD1000000030_S0000038	i think it is somewhere around one or 2 minutes the benefit that most would get from this too
POD1000000030_S0000039	the price of progress i guess ian hunter there who works with usa track field
POD1000000030_S0000041	and now for some related links nike shoes 1st came to prominence in 2016 when they were worn by the 1st 3 finishers in the rio olympics men is marathon
POD1000000030_S0000042	an estimated 95 of the 1st 100 finishers in last year is valencia marathon were wearing vaporfly shoes
POD1000000030_S0000043	that is just 2 of the statistics that reuters has pulled together to show the dominance of this tech in various different versions some graphs in their article too for my fellow data nerds
POD1000000030_S0000044	i also got lost in a new wall street journal video on the shoes and the controversy around them which as it says some are calling a seismic shift
POD1000000030_S0000045	so we will link you to that and a voice you hear on marketplace tech from time to time nick thompson editor in chief of wired magazine is also a keen marathoner
POD1000000030_S0000046	and he set out to put these sneakers to the test himself by running the new york marathon wearing them and crunching all of his data
POD1000000030_S0000047	they felt strange and wobbly at 1st he says my initial steps reminded me of putting on ice skates and then walking on a rubber mat to the rink
POD1000000030_S0000048	but once i started running the strangeness disappeared and i forgot i was wearing them
POD1000000030_S0000049	more of his experiences and his crunching of the scientific data to see if he experienced the tech doping effect at marketplacetech org
POD1000000030_S0000050	i am jack stewart and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000030_S0000052	this is apm
POD1000000031_S0000001	the holidays are over it is back to reality for most of us and back to some distant warehouse for a lot of our unwanted gifts
POD1000000031_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000031_S0000003	i am jack stewart in for molly wood
POD1000000031_S0000005	this season is online holiday sales were worth some $1380 to e retailers
POD1000000031_S0000006	but nearly a 3rd of that stuff is expected to be returned according to new research from cbre a real estate research group
POD1000000031_S0000007	and that is pretty typical 30% of online shopping is returned versus 8% of stuff bought in shops
POD1000000031_S0000008	and all of those returns come with a cost even if they are free to us the shoppers
POD1000000031_S0000009	there is the emissions from the trucks and planes the waste from packaging and discarded products the cost of finding space for it all or even just chucking it out
POD1000000031_S0000010	david egan with cbre says right about now warehouse workers are getting buried
POD1000000031_S0000011	well it is just the flood of packages when you think about the way the supply chain is built and designed it really is meant to be as efficient as possible in moving product from the point of production so wherever something is made to the end point the point of consumption
POD1000000031_S0000012	and all of the networks the buildings the flow through the buildings the transportation networks even the way the employees are trained to handle the packages are really meant to get that stuff moving out as quickly as possible
POD1000000031_S0000013	are there ways that we could use technology to try to mitigate this problem
POD1000000031_S0000014	in my opinion the real solution is going to be a technological solution at the point of sale so how do you provide the customer better assurance that what they are buying is what they actually want
POD1000000031_S0000015	so the classic example is someone buys 3 or 4 shirts with the intention of only keeping one or 2 of them because they do not know if the size is right they do not know if the color is quite going to be right they do not know what it is going to feel like
POD1000000031_S0000016	and i do think there are technologies between augmented reality and virtual reality where we will be able to shop online and have a more you know a sense of an in person type of experience which i believe will really substantially reduce the number of returns that occur
POD1000000031_S0000017	the other side of it though is that offering that type of free frictionless seamless return policy is really important to keeping customers
POD1000000031_S0000018	do you think we as consumers have a role to play here i mean returns are so easy most of the time they are free they are maybe something we do not even think about as much as we should
POD1000000031_S0000019	i think we need to incur some of the costs frankly i do think that the free and painless return system that we have all been accustomed to dealing with is long term not sustainable
POD1000000031_S0000020	so i do think in some place we need to understand how damaging it is not only to the retailers that we are doing business with but also to the environment
POD1000000031_S0000021	you know one fact that i find shocking frankly is that in the united states alone £50 of return merchandise gets put in the landfill every single year just in the us
POD1000000031_S0000022	so merchandise that has been handled and enough time has passed between the point of sale to the return point that has been deemed worthless and it gets thrown away £50 a year
POD1000000031_S0000023	so i mean it is just it is a destructive type of system that we are all taking part in i think we all need to do our part to make it go away
POD1000000031_S0000024	and one of the ways to do that is to pay for it and when people are asked to pay for something they will be a lot more careful about the way they behave
POD1000000031_S0000025	now the flip side of that is that the consumers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of free and frictionless returns and have said that they will find someone if you will not give it to me someone else will
POD1000000031_S0000026	so fixing this is not going to be easy it is really hard to imagine the 1st retailer that is going to be brave enough to turn around and say sure we will take your returns but it is actually going to cost you
POD1000000031_S0000027	that was david egan with cbre
POD1000000031_S0000029	and now for some related links
POD1000000031_S0000030	it is impossible to talk about online shopping without mentioning the behemoth that is amazon as adweek says where it goes other retailers follow
POD1000000031_S0000031	and in the last decade it has set new standards and expectations for delivery pushing its competitors to do the same
POD1000000031_S0000032	adweek has the 5 ways which amazon changed shopping in the 2010s
POD1000000031_S0000033	with returns often being free it is really not surprising that consumers are not aware of the real costs
POD1000000031_S0000034	or maybe we just like to assume or hope that those unwanted items that we so carefully return with all their original packaging intact are then restocked and resold
POD1000000031_S0000035	the idea that a good chunk of them end up in landfill is as the la times calls it a hidden environmental crisis
POD1000000031_S0000036	david egan explained that the logistics operation is set up to run smoothly in one direction getting things to us
POD1000000031_S0000037	there are a lot of efforts to streamline the opposite direction too though there are companies making it their business to help retailers and consumers
POD1000000031_S0000038	so if you do ever step out from behind your computer and actually go to malls a little more frequently than me you have probably noticed some return bars where you can drop off purchases and have someone else just deal with all that sending it back stuff for you
POD1000000031_S0000039	and for the sellers these companies promise to analyze returns and the reasons for them and reduce the packaging they need vogue business breaks it down
POD1000000031_S0000040	but i think really the new year is resolution that i am taking away from all of this is just to buy less stuff i am jack stewart and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000031_S0000042	this is apm
POD1000000031_S0000043	hello to 2020 and to all the new marketplace investors who joined us before the end of the decade
POD1000000031_S0000044	thank you for being part of this community of donors who believe in the importance of trustworthy independent news and information
POD1000000031_S0000045	it is your ongoing support that keeps us strong and helps make people smarter everywhere thanks again and happy new year
POD1000000032_S0000001	the us needs a lot more hospital beds fast
POD1000000032_S0000002	kentec help us build them
POD1000000032_S0000003	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000032_S0000004	i am molly wood
POD1000000032_S0000006	states and cities are rushing to find hospital beds to prepare for an increase in patients suffering from covid 19
POD1000000032_S0000007	in new york makeshift hospitals are going up in central park a navy hospital ship is in the city is harbor
POD1000000032_S0000008	its javits convention center has been converted into a temporary medical facility and the u s army corps of engineers is looking to convert empty hotels and other buildings into hospitals across the country
POD1000000032_S0000009	now as part of its response to the coronavirus the chinese government built 2 giant hospitals in 10 days
POD1000000032_S0000010	and we wondered could we build hospitals that fast here in the us and what tech exists to innovate on the construction process
POD1000000032_S0000011	chris jettina is working on it he is the ceo of the manufacturing and design firm blocks which specializes in modular medical facility construction
POD1000000032_S0000012	we deliver acute care facilities think about hospitals we design them digitally and we manufacture them in our plant
POD1000000032_S0000013	and imagine a big complex lego that we can ship out and then when we get there we assemble it as a completed building
POD1000000032_S0000014	and all of this relies on a bunch of technology that we use the digital design and the supply chain and the machines that make these parts real together
POD1000000032_S0000015	but at the end we take raw material and we turn it into hospitals
POD1000000032_S0000016	and about how long does that take
POD1000000032_S0000017	a typical building may take 12 to 16 months to make
POD1000000032_S0000018	and we do it in 4 months now and every day we have a team that is working to make it faster and faster
POD1000000032_S0000019	yeah you know i asked that because no pressure but it seems as though we are going to need some health care facilities quickly
POD1000000032_S0000020	how do you see your company being a part of that
POD1000000032_S0000021	so a few weeks ago when the size of this pandemic became clear
POD1000000032_S0000022	our team had to refocus i mean we were making permanent hospitals and we were doing them really fast but we had to think about how to take this problem and put it through our machine blocks
POD1000000032_S0000023	and figure out how to do that so that we could get hospital beds quicker
POD1000000032_S0000024	we set out immediately to design a 24 bed micu
POD1000000032_S0000025	you know
POD1000000032_S0000026	a micu is a mobile isolation care unit this micu it has got 3 jobs
POD1000000032_S0000027	and the 1st one is it has got to protect the frontline health care worker
POD1000000032_S0000028	and then there is this 2nd thing that they have got to do which is they are designed to protect the hospital is existing capacity
POD1000000032_S0000029	and then the final one is we are trying to make these micus become a permanent and flexible asset that helps serve the health system going forward
POD1000000032_S0000030	so i mean they are institutional grade they are reusable
POD1000000032_S0000031	it is a fleet of icu rooms that gets to be moved in the future to wherever the hot spot is
POD1000000032_S0000032	how much do they cost
POD1000000032_S0000033	these things will be around $20 to $30 a bed in the beginning and then those prices will drop down
POD1000000032_S0000034	so these are significantly less expensive but they are still high tech devices that are chock full of equipment and pressurization and electronics and they are still pretty expensive boxes
POD1000000032_S0000035	can you tell us at all where these projects might be happening like where you are putting up these mickeys
POD1000000032_S0000036	well we are not putting them up yet so it is still going to production in 2 weeks
POD1000000032_S0000037	the 1st ones could be in any of the spots that are needed
POD1000000032_S0000038	so obviously we have been in pretty heavy discussions in new york we have been in discussions in georgia and there is a big there is a big delta between those 2 places but it really does not matter to us where they are needed
POD1000000032_S0000039	they can go just as easily to one or the other
POD1000000032_S0000040	and then just out of curiosity is it sort of like a modular house where it is basically sort of pre built and then it just comes on a big truck
POD1000000032_S0000041	you know parts of it are so a lego analogy is really a pretty good one
POD1000000032_S0000042	if you think about a lego kit or advanced one it has different types of parts
POD1000000032_S0000043	some of them are volumetric and some of them are custom parts and some of them are little pieces that can be used in a 1000 different ways
POD1000000032_S0000044	and we are agnostic about it we think that there is just a value stream that goes from raw material and it is converted into a usable building
POD1000000032_S0000045	and the process that it goes through is a whole lot of different stages
POD1000000032_S0000046	we are just trying to find an optimal one
POD1000000032_S0000047	there is not always a right path because of in fact we are using many of the things that we do for a regular hospital right now
POD1000000032_S0000048	but we have made different changes the foundation for example is significantly different on a micu
POD1000000032_S0000049	it does not need all of the permanence that an acute care hospital may have you know that has a 50 year lifespan
POD1000000032_S0000050	so the idea is we think of it as completed parts but every part is completed
POD1000000032_S0000051	and it goes together in a form of chunking
POD1000000032_S0000052	it is kind of the way they build the new boeing 787 dreamliner it is not made on an assembly line the way you think of an assembly line
POD1000000032_S0000053	it is made in chunks that are made all over the world and they have all brought together in charleston and put together as an oem in a matter of days
POD1000000032_S0000054	so that is more like what we are doing with blocks
POD1000000032_S0000055	got it what makes these specific to medical facilities
POD1000000032_S0000056	what kind of certification and technology goes into that
POD1000000032_S0000057	hospitals are really heavily regulated
POD1000000032_S0000058	and if you try and understand which ones there are it is a long list
POD1000000032_S0000059	and so what i would just simply say is these things are dealing with life safety at an institutional level they are dealing with emergency power critical care operations
POD1000000032_S0000060	they are dealing with temperature control that is based on air exchanges which allow you to evacuate disease and infection
POD1000000032_S0000061	they are designed to be visible and operational high performances if you will
POD1000000032_S0000062	so these nurses and doctors are under an enormous amount of pressure
POD1000000032_S0000063	and what you are trying to do is create a place which is safe for them to work but visually controlled so they can see everything at once
POD1000000032_S0000064	and that is what we focused on how do we make this really a beautiful elegantly simple operationally visually controlled device that is technologically empowered
POD1000000032_S0000065	and can be deployed really fast and still be done with the stuff that is available today not the stuff that we wish was available today
POD1000000032_S0000066	you said that you are trying to take a typical construction time for a building from 12 to 18 months down to 4 months
POD1000000032_S0000067	how long will it take to construct these micus
POD1000000032_S0000068	so the 1st one will roll off in june the end of may and it will be operational a week later
POD1000000032_S0000069	and then after that they will just keep coming as long as they are needed
POD1000000032_S0000070	so once the line is loaded then think of it as just a continuous river that keeps dropping them out
POD1000000032_S0000071	so there is about 10 large modules in each one of these and every day and a half another 10 will be ready to be shipped
POD1000000032_S0000072	let me ask you this it is clearly a technological miracle in a lot of ways
POD1000000032_S0000073	june is a long ways away do you wish that you had started getting calls sooner
POD1000000032_S0000075	yes necessity is the mother of invention and i think that we are as a nation in the midst of a necessity
POD1000000032_S0000076	i like what i see in terms of the human spirit coming together to try and solve hard problems right now
POD1000000032_S0000077	chris jettina is ceo of the modular medical facility construction firm blox
POD1000000032_S0000078	he said the company is talking right now with a few states about building the micus he mentioned
POD1000000032_S0000079	but so far has not finalized any deals
POD1000000032_S0000081	and now for some related links to that point about whether blocks is already building facilities
POD1000000032_S0000082	fast company has a piece on how yes we have the technology and the modular construction expertise to get buildings up quickly
POD1000000032_S0000083	but we also have a lot of logistics and red tape problems
POD1000000032_S0000084	the army corps of engineers as you heard wants to convert existing facilities
POD1000000032_S0000085	but for the reasons that jatina mentioned a hotel or convention center is not ideal for the job those buildings are hard to sterilize
POD1000000032_S0000086	they need hvac systems that can prevent infectious diseases from being pumped into every room and they have plenty of other medical needs as well
POD1000000032_S0000087	the piece points to some modular design companies that are creating medical pods that can be built quickly
POD1000000032_S0000088	some others in addition to blocks
POD1000000032_S0000089	but since each city and state has its own rules around construction and permits and even just a shortage of actual land to put modules on
POD1000000032_S0000090	it is a tough problem to solve quickly at a time when speed is what we need
POD1000000032_S0000092	and here is what else we are watching in tech
POD1000000032_S0000093	the wall street journal reports that no surprise the u s is already starting to track people is smartphone data to analyze movements and ultimately build a database that can show at a national level
POD1000000032_S0000094	how well social distancing measures are working and where people might be gathering together in large groups so that authorities can both crack down and potentially predict a future outbreak
POD1000000032_S0000095	and look we are going to talk a lot more about this later in the week this need for a data driven response to this outbreak and the fact that this is useful existing data
POD1000000032_S0000096	and the fact that it is also likely to become a privacy invasion at a grand scale
POD1000000032_S0000097	techcrunch has a piece about how singapore is collecting data in a more privacy friendly way through an app called tracetogether
POD1000000032_S0000098	that is what mit is trying to do with its app safe paths but both cases rely on people downloading the app and using it and voluntarily reporting information
POD1000000032_S0000099	in singapore there is a more central authority that can make people do the thing
POD1000000032_S0000100	that is a lot harder in the us and since the data already exists in one giant cookie jar full of delicious quarantine baked cookies
POD1000000032_S0000101	it is going to be real hard to convince the cookie monster to find another treat

POD1000000034_S0000004	how amazon has become a big part of this covid 19 life and in more ways than you might think from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000034_S0000005	i am kimberly adams in for molly wood
POD1000000034_S0000007	as we continue to deal with the coronavirus outbreak many of us are doing more online shopping and relying on amazon more than ever amazon has hired about 80000 new workers to keep up with the demand
POD1000000034_S0000008	and following employee walkouts and protests the company announced thursday it would start taking employees temperatures at work and provide face masks
POD1000000034_S0000009	amazon in the era of covid 19 is the topic for this week is quality assurance where we take a 2nd look at a big story in the news matt day covers amazon for bloomberg
POD1000000034_S0000010	and we talked about whether the company fit into that now crucial designation of essential
POD1000000034_S0000011	obviously a good deal of amazon is kind of essential in these times particularly if you are somebody with mobility issues you are somebody who for health reasons does not want to even take the risk of going to a supermarket or big box store that remains open you are reliant on e commerce
POD1000000034_S0000012	on that regard if you are trying to get dry goods or hand sanitizer or wipes chances are you are using amazon com but one of the drawbacks that we found of this environment at least if you talk to amazon is workers is that they are still shipping a lot of non essential stuff
POD1000000034_S0000013	amazon is digital doors remain open for books for toys games for everything else that they have been selling online anyway they are still shipping that and there is workers in facilities around the country still risking their own health going into work
POD1000000034_S0000014	in the service of moving those goods to your door too
POD1000000034_S0000015	we are talking about e commerce but amazon also has a lot of other businesses right
POD1000000034_S0000016	right right and there is a bunch of other areas that they stand to likely benefit from this one of them it does not get talked about quite as much as delivery but amazon web services their cloud computing group which is essentially on demand software or processing power
POD1000000034_S0000017	businesses with employees working from home are making more use of that analysts say and then if you are sitting at home watching netflix or using a variety of internet services a lot of the backbones of those live on amazon web services
POD1000000034_S0000018	it is kind of the conventional wisdom that they stand to gain too from this environment right now
POD1000000034_S0000019	you know so many of our conversations are about what happens after we come out of this even though it is hard to even envision when that is or what the world is going to look like at that point
POD1000000034_S0000020	but when we look at amazon a year from now what kind of stories do you think you will be writing about this company and its business
POD1000000034_S0000021	i think we are going to be writing about how this as catastrophic an event as it is proving to be globally this is kind of the thing that amazon was built for they have spent most of the last decade building a giant logistics network in the us and parts of europe
POD1000000034_S0000022	really in an unprecedented way get goods to you quicker and to every doorstep they can access they have been touting e commerce since that term was new so i think in a lot of ways they are a company built to take advantage of this
POD1000000034_S0000023	now it has not been a glorious couple of months for them they have had some complaints from workers about non essential goods and the rate at which they have been worked there has been the usual criticisms from us senators about giving workers better pay
POD1000000034_S0000024	has been an issue at amazon off and on for a while but to a large extent this company was designed to handle these kind of challenges so i think if this indeed means a sort of permanent increase in online commerce amazon would stand to gain a tremendous amount from it
POD1000000034_S0000025	and then the question is just whether they are able to capitalize on that you know the way their business leaders would hope or if some of the pr backlash related to some of these controversies hampers them
POD1000000034_S0000026	we have seen protests this week by delivery workers and people working in amazon is warehouses will this have an effect on the company is operations
POD1000000034_S0000027	the issue with amazon it has been a complicated story for a long time but one of the things this crisis is doing is some of those folks are kind of taking the opportunity to speak in a way that they have not before there was a walkout in an amazon warehouse just outside of detroit
POD1000000034_S0000028	it was the 3rd walkout in 3 days at an amazon facility across the country and that is just something you do not see very often
POD1000000034_S0000029	so clearly workers who feel under extreme amounts of pressure themselves think that this is an opportunity for them to maybe ask things of management that would have been more difficult under sort of business as usual conditions
POD1000000034_S0000030	bloomberg is matt day amazon also says it is no longer going to sell n 95 masks and other urgently needed covid 19 related supplies to regular customers
POD1000000034_S0000031	the company has a new section of its website just for these products and says it will prioritize them for hospitals and government agencies
POD1000000034_S0000033	and now for some related links matt day recently wrote about amazon is surge in hiring to meet all the demand from people stuck at home due to coronavirus
POD1000000034_S0000034	and some of that hiring last month was happening at job fairs where people were not exactly able to practice social distancing
POD1000000034_S0000035	amazon said it is since updated its recruiting strategies to according to matt is reports keep applicants safe
POD1000000034_S0000037	and my colleague andy uhler covered those amazon protests we were talking about
POD1000000034_S0000038	and speaking of safety instacart says it is going to start providing full service shoppers with a safety kit including a mask hand sanitizer and a thermometer
POD1000000034_S0000039	shoppers have to request the kits but they are supposed to be free you can find the links to all these stories at marketplace org
POD1000000034_S0000041	and here is what else we are watching after years of negotiations a bunch of lawsuits a department of justice investigation 10s of dollars in lobbying and some extra stays at the trump hotel
POD1000000034_S0000042	the merger between t mobile and sprint is finally done that deal is worth about $260 and leaves us with just 3 big wireless networks at t verizon and t mobile and no one else
POD1000000034_S0000043	stephanie hughes produces marketplace tech jesus alvarado is our assistant producer jody becker is our senior editor and robin edgar is our engineer i am kimberly adams and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000034_S0000045	this is apm
POD1000000035_S0000001	huge numbers of people signing up for unemployment are exposing an infrastructure problem in states
POD1000000035_S0000002	really really old technology
POD1000000035_S0000003	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am molly wood
POD1000000035_S0000005	new jersey is governor recently went on tv asking for volunteers who know cobol a more than 60 year old computer programming language
POD1000000035_S0000006	that is because the state is unemployment benefit system runs on a decades old mainframe that can not keep up with the volume of requests for financial help
POD1000000035_S0000007	and new jersey is not alone several states not to mention lots of financial institutions are all at the mercy of these very old systems running on a programming language that is not even taught in schools anymore
POD1000000035_S0000008	joseph steinberg is a cybersecurity consultant and author of the book cybersecurities for dummies
POD1000000035_S0000009	well 1st of all there are many financial institutions that use mainframes with cobol for back end processing of transactions and batch processing
POD1000000035_S0000010	i think they probably have things in a lot better shape because they have the resources in house
POD1000000035_S0000011	in some cases they have replaced the systems at great expense over recent years in some cases they are doing it now
POD1000000035_S0000012	and in some cases they have made the decisions to actually train people to be able to support these systems going forward
POD1000000035_S0000013	but when it comes to government and i would say probably even worse in the state governments than in the federal
POD1000000035_S0000014	you have many systems that seem to hang around for a very long time
POD1000000035_S0000015	one of the questions that i posed in the last week is simply if god forbid this pandemic continued for several more months and all americans had to vote in the presidential election remotely
POD1000000035_S0000016	
POD1000000035_S0000017	do all 50 states actually have computer systems that could accommodate that volume of ballots going out and in to be counted processed in a secure fashion in any reasonable time frame
POD1000000035_S0000018	and i am afraid of what the answer to that question might be we simply have a lot of legacy systems involved in various state processes and they are not meant they were never designed to accommodate mass loads that could suddenly happen now
POD1000000035_S0000019	
POD1000000035_S0000020	and it is a lot harder to scale these legacy systems
POD1000000035_S0000021	newer technologies scale much better and i am afraid of what is out there you know at the state level
POD1000000035_S0000022	and i am sure there is some in the federal government but you know after this pandemic is over it is really going to be time to take a serious look at a lot of these older systems and evaluate whether they really are reliable only because we have not had to make changes or they are really reliable
POD1000000035_S0000023	and i think in many cases we will find it is the former
POD1000000035_S0000024	right i mean it seems like this is sort of an invisible infrastructure problem in america that in some ways is as expensive and difficult to fix as roads and bridges
POD1000000035_S0000025	it is as expensive and perhaps in some ways more dangerous because you do not notice it until the problem happens
POD1000000035_S0000026	you have people who desperately need money because their work suddenly ended they place an unemployment claim and they can not get it processed
POD1000000035_S0000027	that can be dangerous people could be low on food and other supplies and it is not like they can easily obtain them now either
POD1000000035_S0000028	and i think that is precisely the issue with these older systems
POD1000000035_S0000029	often we assume that they are reliable until it is too late and the problem has hit and at that point you have got a tactical problem how do we process these unemployment claims
POD1000000035_S0000030	and a strategic problem how do we make sure this never happens again in the future
POD1000000035_S0000031	you are saying that even if we were able to bring a lot of programmers out of retirement that these systems simply may not ever be able to handle the load that is being put on them now
POD1000000035_S0000032	it may be possible to scale them up with improved hardware but that is going to be very expensive number one
POD1000000035_S0000033	and they do not scale as simply as more modern systems do so you know the fact that you are hiring programmers out of retirement and people do not live forever
POD1000000035_S0000034	you are not going to have an endless supply of programmers who programmed in the 70s in the workforce
POD1000000035_S0000035	and i am not saying that these systems are not reliable they may be very reliable for what they do now
POD1000000035_S0000036	
POD1000000035_S0000037	but we have to accept the fact that systems may need to be changed and may need to scale up suddenly and we may not be able to do it with the existing technology and human resources
POD1000000035_S0000038	i mean i have been at companies that replatformed and it is hard and it is really expensive and what does that look like at a sort of state and national level what kind of investment in terms of both technology and money would that take
POD1000000035_S0000039	the thing to keep in mind is there is also a political problem with things like this
POD1000000035_S0000040	you know if you are a state elected official and you have to budget a large amount of money for replacing a system no user of that system initially benefits from it
POD1000000035_S0000041	so you need to have the political will which i think after this we will to invest the money before problems happen understanding that you are investing for the future
POD1000000035_S0000042	we should have our infrastructure set up that if there is an emergency in which people are dying the governor should be focused on people not on technical glitches in an unemployment system
POD1000000035_S0000043	right this is speculative and a vaguely nightmare scenario but at what point do you think companies
POD1000000035_S0000045	like an amazon or microsoft or google might approach states and the federal government and say maybe you need a private solution a privatized infrastructure for some of this
POD1000000035_S0000047	i do not know if they already have they may have approached them years ago and been told that the system is working we have no need to replace it i do not know
POD1000000035_S0000048	but i am sure that after this is all over as the governor himself said we are going to have a post mortem
POD1000000035_S0000049	and then after that postmortem there is going to be evaluations of many different options as to how to proceed and some of those will involve utilizing 3rd party resources potentially
POD1000000035_S0000050	by the way you could have a cloud that is run by the government it could be a private cloud system it could be their own infrastructure
POD1000000035_S0000051	you know there are many many options but moving away from the cobol code running on the mainframe to a more modern platform might allow for greater scalability suddenly if needed as well as for easier maintenance if code changes need to be made
POD1000000035_S0000052	you are certainly not going to need to go begging for programmers at a press conference
POD1000000035_S0000054	joseph steinberg is a cybersecurity consultant
POD1000000035_S0000056	and now for some related links we have got a link to that 2016 report from the government accountability office which found that among other things the department of defense uses 8 inch floppy disks to coordinate some of the country is nuclear forces
POD1000000035_S0000057	you can see why they want to get that big cloud project moving i guess
POD1000000035_S0000058	in other infrastructure news mit technology review has a piece this week about how generally speaking the internet is holding up shockingly well in the midst of our big transition from work and school to home
POD1000000035_S0000059	it points out that cloud service providers and also streaming media and telecom companies
POD1000000035_S0000060	so think amazon or comcast netflix microsoft google they all put a lot of money into new internet infrastructure in the past decade or so in order to keep delivering their services
POD1000000035_S0000061	and now this current crisis is generating even more investment
POD1000000035_S0000062	now if only we could do the same for the power grid and the bridges and the state and county mainframes
POD1000000035_S0000064	and here is what else we are watching in tech a berudol week at yelp
POD1000000035_S0000065	the company that is basically built on small businesses is laying off 1000 people and furloughing another 1100 according to axios
POD1000000035_S0000066	yelp is ceo will take no salary for the rest of the year and the company is cutting executive pay by 20 to 30%
POD1000000035_S0000068	also on thursday microsoft released a report about remote work trends based on data from its teams product
POD1000000035_S0000069	the company of course reported a huge increase in the number of people using teams
POD1000000035_S0000070	but the report has some super interesting data
POD1000000035_S0000071	for example it notes that people are using video in their meetings a lot more than they ever did before
POD1000000035_S0000072	a 1000% more in march in fact
POD1000000035_S0000073	but the u s lags a little bit in terms of video calling
POD1000000035_S0000074	in norway and the netherlands about 60% of calls include video but only 38% of american meetings have the camera turned on
POD1000000035_S0000075	i mean listen i am just going to confess that i straight up refused to join a meeting by video on thursday because i for one can no longer stand the sight of my own forehead
POD1000000035_S0000076	i see you america or rather i only hear you
POD1000000035_S0000077	stephanie hughes produces marketplace tech jesus alvarado is our assistant producer jody becker is our senior editor robin edgar is our engineer i am mollie wood and that is marketplace tech have a great weekend
POD1000000035_S0000078	this is apm
POD1000000036_S0000001	facebook users in illinois could each be in line for a couple of $100 for privacy violations what does that mean for the rest of us
POD1000000036_S0000002	from american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy i am jack stewart in for molly wood
POD1000000036_S0000004	about a decade ago facebook started automatically tagging people whose faces its algorithms had recognized in our uploaded photos at the time it seemed like magic
POD1000000036_S0000005	but this week facebook has agreed to pay $550 over claims that tool violated privacy rights the settlement is in illinois which has strict laws protecting biometric data
POD1000000036_S0000006	facebook revealed the settlement agreement at the same time as its quarterly financial results this week and they by the way showed that revenue was up 25% to $210 at the end of last year
POD1000000036_S0000007	for today is quality assurance we have natasha singh a tech reporter for the new york times to explain what this settlement means
POD1000000036_S0000008	so illinois has the toughest biometric privacy law in the united states there are only 3 states that have these kind of laws
POD1000000036_S0000009	and so biometric privacy pertains to your fingerprints or facial scans for facial recognition and so in illinois the law says that companies can not collect that kind of information like facial data for facial recognition without getting written permission from someone
POD1000000036_S0000010	and also they can not collect the data without telling somebody how long they are going to keep it and so facebook users in illinois sued facebook saying that it had collected their facial information and had not obtained their kind of affirmative opt in permission and had not told them how long that facebook was going to keep it
POD1000000036_S0000011	facebook says that these claims are not true but facebook said that it settled this lawsuit because it was going to you know drag on and take up too much resources and it was better for everybody and the stockholders if they settled the lawsuit
POD1000000036_S0000012	do you think the size of this facebook settlement might serve as a warning to other companies who are considering this sort of technology
POD1000000036_S0000013	it feels like maybe when facebook introduced things like facial recognition they were just looking at fun ways of using it and maybe some of the other implications are now coming to light
POD1000000036_S0000014	if you think about a face print it is like the facial equivalent of your fingerprint and you might want to use your fingerprint for fun ways
POD1000000036_S0000015	but we kind of viscerally know that your fingerprint has all kinds of implications and it is unique so even the notion of facebook turning on facial recognition by default for fun things is problematic 1st of all in illinois
POD1000000036_S0000016	but also to a lot of people who are concerned that the problem with facial recognition is that it can be used to identify people without their knowledge at a distance
POD1000000036_S0000017	and so it implicates your ability to be anonymous both online and in public
POD1000000036_S0000018	do you think there is a chance we will see companies basically defaulting to just not collecting any data like this at the risk of it somehow being regulated in the future
POD1000000036_S0000019	certainly i think companies that are having similar technology and they have illinois users must be thinking about it right because if you think about like doorbell cams which are spreading everywhere
POD1000000036_S0000020	well your doorbell camera is going to take images of people and it is used for facial recognition right so that like it can recognize your babysitter so that they can come in in illinois you need consent for stuff like that
POD1000000036_S0000021	and so what does that mean for all kinds of devices that collect ambient biometric data i think we do not have the answer to that i think that companies now because of the size of the facebook settlement are going to have to think about what their illinois plan is
POD1000000036_S0000022	i can not imagine that they want to have one set of software for illinois and another for the rest of the country 1st of all that is just from a business perspective inefficient
POD1000000036_S0000023	but 2nd of all you do not want people in other parts of the country saying well you turned that off for illinois why have not you turned it off for us
POD1000000036_S0000024	and so we are seeing for example with the california privacy law that our number of companies microsoft apple have said we are going to honor the rights under the california privacy law for everybody in the united states
POD1000000036_S0000025	it feels like when we talk about these privacy stories we talk about the value of your privacy or the value of your data and it is always very hard to put a number on that
POD1000000036_S0000026	do you think things like this illinois settlement are starting to move in that direction and putting a dollar value on these things
POD1000000036_S0000027	so i think the notion that there is a trade and you are trading your data for services and so you are giving up some of your privacy is the silicon valley framing that you are getting value for data
POD1000000036_S0000028	but when we think of a trade you know what you are giving up and what you are getting but when you give up your data you have no idea how it is going to be used
POD1000000036_S0000029	it can be used perennially for all time for all kinds of purposes for which you did not give it and i would argue that it is not a trade it is not a fair trade and i would also argue that data is not property
POD1000000036_S0000030	in europe security and privacy are fundamental human rights and if we think of other fundamental human rights like the right of free speech you would not say i am trading my free speech for facebook services
POD1000000036_S0000031	so this notion that we are trading our right to privacy for services i think is just a problematic framing
POD1000000036_S0000033	for the new york times according to the chicago tribune a federal court judge must approve the facebook settlement
POD1000000036_S0000034	and then members of the class action
POD1000000036_S0000036	claims for part of the money
POD1000000036_S0000038	for some related links today check out natasha is story at the new york times for more detail on the settlement and next steps as well as coverage from the chicago tribune for more on why illinois has become so important for privacy lawsuits
POD1000000036_S0000039	and then if you did not read it a couple of weeks ago well set aside a good few minutes to completely digest the new york times story the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it it is about clearview ai a little known company that created an app for law enforcement to use facial recognition
POD1000000036_S0000040	as the article says without public scrutiny more than 600 law enforcement agencies have started using clearview in the past year and while big tech companies are at least facing some scrutiny for their facial recognition efforts this company seems to have flown under the radar until now
POD1000000036_S0000041	well so what you might think i have done nothing wrong why does it matter if my face is recognized in public privacy campaigners would argue that we are just not aware yet of everything that we are giving up
POD1000000036_S0000042	the new york times took the feed from 3 public webcams in new york and photos from employer websites
POD1000000036_S0000043	and using that they matched 2750 faces as just one example they found a professor on his way to lunch with a job candidate
POD1000000036_S0000044	as the times says our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn people is daily habits when they arrive at the office each day who they get coffee with whether they left work early
POD1000000036_S0000045	the professor is reaction when he was told was 0 my god that is unbelievable but these days it really is easier and easier to believe
POD1000000036_S0000046	i am jack stewart and that is marketplace tech
POD1000000036_S0000048	this is apm
POD1000000037_S0000001	summer camp fresh air bonfires or you know staying inside and learning how to shoot youtube videos
POD1000000037_S0000003	for american public media this is marketplace tech demystifying the digital economy
POD1000000037_S0000004	i am jed kim in for mollywood
POD1000000037_S0000006	summer vacation is rapidly approaching for some families that means sending kids to camp some of those are youtube camps
POD1000000037_S0000007	essentially places where kids can learn how to create slicker youtube videos and channels
POD1000000037_S0000008	the demand has grown as kids want to emulate the online stars they watch
POD1000000037_S0000009	julie jargon is the family and tech columnist at the wall street journal and she wrote about the trend
POD1000000037_S0000010	she said kids learn how to light shoot and edit videos also how to develop their personal brands
POD1000000037_S0000011	they are teaching them to create their own unique voice so that they can stand out in the crowd of youtubers and develop original content
POD1000000037_S0000012	but you know a lot of the kids i talk to they just want to shoot videos of themselves playing fortnite
POD1000000037_S0000013	so there is a lot of that already but that is what a lot of kids are interested in doing they watch the youtubers playing video games and then they want to do it themselves
POD1000000037_S0000014	yeah i got to say i hear youtube camp and my initial reaction is gross
POD1000000037_S0000016	but i know that is just like me being uninformed and reactionary help me understand the value of this
POD1000000037_S0000017	well you know i mean i think that is the reaction actually of a lot of parents and i there is a debate raging in a lot of households right now about whether to allow children to have their own youtube channels
POD1000000037_S0000018	and a lot of the 1st time reaction from parents is no
POD1000000037_S0000019	you know there is a lot of concerns about kids being exposed publicly and being open to bullying and predators and all that stuff that we worry about on the internet
POD1000000037_S0000020	but a lot of the parents i spoke to who also shared those concerns you know kind of went about it thoughtfully and said well my kid wants to do something they are passionate about it how do i foster that
POD1000000037_S0000021	and is there a way to look at youtube as a medium that can be an outlet for their creativity to develop the skills that they might not be able to develop on their own at home
POD1000000037_S0000022	and also how can those skills translate to other life experiences
POD1000000037_S0000023	and also just learning the poise and the composure of speaking on film and addressing an audience
POD1000000037_S0000024	you know those are all good things for kids to know how to do
POD1000000037_S0000025	yeah summer is this i guess it is like a blank canvas for kids to do whatever they want or i guess what their parents want them to learn
POD1000000037_S0000026	and are parents more valuing developing digital skills than they were in the past
POD1000000037_S0000027	i think so i think there is a growing awareness of the fact that these kind of skills could be useful for future careers i mean gaming alone is such a huge industry
POD1000000037_S0000028	a lot of kids go to coding camps to learn how to code video games
POD1000000037_S0000029	so there are a lot of digital sort of skills that you know older generation of parents do not have and they are seeing that it could be applicable to future career choices for their children
POD1000000037_S0000030	some parents are increasingly concerned about screen time and social media and spending all day video gaming even if it is for learning
POD1000000037_S0000031	so what makes a family more wary of tech compared to other families that are like go for it
POD1000000037_S0000032	i just think it comes down to an individual choice and individual feelings about technology some families just really embrace it and they do not want their kids to be behind
POD1000000037_S0000033	and they feel like if their kids are not learning these skills or aware of what is going on on social media and the internet more broadly that they will somehow be social outcasts or they will not have the skills to be competitive in you know in the future workforce
POD1000000037_S0000034	other parents are just really cautious i mean it is not what we grew up with
POD1000000037_S0000035	and so you hear the horror stories and you hear about online bullying and youtube is a very public forum and people can leave mean comments
POD1000000037_S0000036	and is a child really ready to deal with that are they developmentally ready and emotionally ready to let it roll off their skin when someone posts a mean comment about their video
POD1000000037_S0000037	that is a difficult thing for adults to even face that kind of criticism from the trolls and so parents have to really prepare their kids for that
POD1000000037_S0000038	i mean there are things you can do you can moderate the comments that are posted on youtube you can turn them off you can make a youtube channel private so no one can see it
POD1000000037_S0000039	that sort of defeats the whole purpose of posting on youtube though because it is meant to be shared and youtube videos are meant to be commented on
POD1000000037_S0000040	it is just a whole new world that parents are trying to navigate and it really comes down to personal choice as to whether you want your kids to jump into that world or maybe kind of keep them away from it to the extent possible
POD1000000037_S0000041	let us talk a little more about kind of the fame side of things some camps that you found were cautioning against building expectations that your kid is going to be a star
POD1000000037_S0000042	but other camps were like using it as a marketing point
POD1000000037_S0000043	anything problematic with that
POD1000000037_S0000044	yeah i mean what is the reality of you know what are the chances that your child is going to achieve some sort of youtube fame
POD1000000037_S0000045	probably pretty slim considering how many videos are on youtube and sort of the mystery about what the algorithm chooses to push up you know i mean you can create a video and get no views
POD1000000037_S0000046	it is really hard sometimes to sift through all the videos and find a video on a particular topic you know and there are something like a 10 hours of youtube videos viewed daily
POD1000000037_S0000047	so how do you break through the clutter and make your video stand out
POD1000000037_S0000048	i mean you know i think parents have to be realistic with themselves and with their children that just because you post a video to youtube does not mean you are going to start you know having a 10 subscribers
POD1000000037_S0000049	rye
POD1000000037_S0000050	and you know advertising and sponsorship contracts and that kind of thing
POD1000000037_S0000051	i mean certainly people have achieved fame and fortune on youtube but just like with anything else you are not going to become necessarily the next star nba player just because you go to a basketball camp
POD1000000037_S0000052	so i think you know you have to just be realistic and understand what you and your what your child wants to achieve with their youtube channel
POD1000000037_S0000053	julie jargon writes about family and tech at the wall street journal i asked her if this means more kids will be coming home from camp starting conversations by saying
POD1000000037_S0000054	hey guys madison here i have got a couple great things to share with you julie said yeah that is already happening even outside of camp
POD1000000037_S0000056	and now for some related links interested to know how youtube is working to weed out the objectionable videos that get uploaded
POD1000000037_S0000057	vox sat down with neil mohan the company is chief product officer he says it is not about just finding bad videos and removing them it is about constantly updating the user guidelines for computer and human workers to follow
POD1000000037_S0000058	among the staggering stats you will read 500 hours of video content gets uploaded every minute more than 10000 people have been hired to make the final decision of whether a video stays or goes
POD1000000037_S0000059	and mohan says corpus no fewer than 7 times corpus as in the full body of work on youtube
POD1000000037_S0000061	let us see what else we got how about the promise of making money through your youtube channel
POD1000000037_S0000062	business insider lays out the path to getting your channel into the youtube partner program 1st thing you have to do in order to be eligible

POD1000000037_S0000064	there is a lot more that goes into it from there like different tiers at which you can access more tools it is a little daunting
POD1000000037_S0000065	and finally learning camps are a way to combat the dreaded summer slide or that thing where your kid gets dumber during the months when they are not in school
POD1000000037_S0000066	lots of articles churn out every year at this time with ways to fight it we found some articles in parenting and read brightly that suggest apps to help

POD1000000039_S0000044	if you were going to write a letter about what would you say

POD1000000039_S0000050	i only wrote a letter to marcella balboa i did not write to anybody else
POD1000000039_S0000051	he said there was a phrase in a set with 2020 hindsight you would have done something different with this what would you have done differently
POD1000000039_S0000052	in 2020 hindsight i should have found a way to get him on that field because i think his experience and his veteranship would have affected the team in a very positive way to this day i feel badly that marcelo balboa did not play more than what he did

POD1000000039_S0000071	world cup
POD1000000039_S0000073	so it was not a question of if he would be whacked but rather of when

POD1000000039_S0000089	but things change quickly
POD1000000039_S0000091	after his boss us soccer federation president alan rothenberg invited him to breakfast in paris

POD1000000039_S0000097	i offered my resignation because one i felt it was the right thing to do because i had lost 3 games in a world championship
POD1000000039_S0000099	and i did not want alan to feel as if he needed to fire me and before he could get it out of his mouth i offered to him to resign from the national team
POD1000000039_S0000101	you told the media this was not steve is fault this was not the players fault they played their hearts out you are a very diplomatic man alan but what were you really thinking at that moment
POD1000000039_S0000103	bitterly disappointed i really was and deep down i guess upset right or wrong i was 2nd guessing myself about the decision to keep steve
POD1000000039_S0000104	it was sort of like all the fears that i had all along have just been realized
POD1000000039_S0000105	so you are angry yourself
POD1000000039_S0000106	i would not say angry but my moment of reflection was

POD1000000039_S0000111	yes

POD1000000039_S0000132	it was a job offer he got the night off to the yugoslavia game
POD1000000039_S0000133	right after dinner i got a phone call from my agent who was at the hotel and bayer leverkusen

POD1000000039_S0000213	this is where all of the coaches and gms will call me on a monday describing the pain they have undergone with either poor officiating or poor discipline
POD1000000039_S0000214	or both
POD1000000039_S0000215	or both yes
POD1000000039_S0000216	and i am looking at an incredibly clean desk clean desk clean mind
POD1000000039_S0000217	next to a picture of his children there is a framed photo of that notorious red card he got playing against mexico in 1997
POD1000000039_S0000218	i have it up to remind me that you can control things about yourself but you can not control what other people do and the only thing you can do is control what you can
POD1000000039_S0000220	i do not believe it was a red card but that does not matter it was a red card and i hurt my team and there were ramifications because of the red card professionally and personally
POD1000000039_S0000222	which brings us back to steve simpson
POD1000000039_S0000224	his career in reverse front loading the big dream job before drifting back towards the roots of the game
POD1000000039_S0000226	after france samson went on to coach the costa rican national team and had spent some time at the club level coaching the los angeles galaxy
POD1000000039_S0000228	today steve is head coach at the california polytechnic state university
POD1000000039_S0000230	so this is the jersey that was worn in the fifa world cup in france 1998 this was presented to me prior to the tournament beginning
POD1000000039_S0000231	we are in steve samson is modest office
POD1000000039_S0000232	to be honest
POD1000000039_S0000233	and he is showing us the jerseys that hang on his wall one in particular has a place of honor
POD1000000039_S0000234	but red short sleeved jersey signed by all the players that participated in the world cup in france again very proud to have had the opportunity to coach these men
POD1000000039_S0000235	does it not conjure even a hint a hint of a dark memory of challenged times when your eyes look at it
POD1000000039_S0000237	0 certainly i mean you know it is it is like i have told people i have experienced the highs of highs and the lows of lows and and it is all part of the journey
POD1000000039_S0000238	that jersey represents to me the entire lead up the qualification phase all the great moments that we had over the years leading up to the world cup and yes of course it conjures up
POD1000000039_S0000239	some disappointment of not achieving what we set out to do but you know in the end an enormous amount of pride
POD1000000039_S0000240	even in the darkness steve
POD1000000039_S0000241	and i am going to be honest steve you have endured more than most more than most managers that i have engaged with despite the darkness is that 1998 world cup is it still a life high point
POD1000000039_S0000243	the 1998 world cup was not just about those 3 weeks in france
POD1000000039_S0000244	it was about probably a period of time that was one of the most dramatic important moments in u s soccer history
POD1000000039_S0000245	and to have been a part of that was a great honor and a great privilege
POD1000000039_S0000247	i do not
POD1000000039_S0000249	do not dismiss my responsibilities at all or my share in the responsibilities
POD1000000039_S0000251	but i think that all of us you know .
POD1000000039_S0000253	everybody should share in the responsibility
POD1000000039_S0000255	i think there were factors that unfortunately did not give us our very best chance of being successful and that is what has made me angry over the years that is what has made me disappointed over the years
POD1000000039_S0000258	do they haunt you in your dreams
POD1000000039_S0000260	do they haunt me in my dreams yeah to be honest every once in a while yes

POD1000000039_S0000275	looking back on 2020 that is the new yorker radio hour from wnyc studios listen wherever you get your
POD1000000039_S0000277	now 20 years on after the petty grievances the outsized vanities the rank embarrassment and the soul crushing future defining big what ifs of those days have pretty much burnt away what remains
POD1000000039_S0000279	for almost everyone i spoke with it is the game of soccer in the us the fight for respect for legitimacy and belonging both within the united states and externally in the eyes of the world
POD1000000039_S0000281	more than anything 1998 was supposed to be the year that this group of guys playing this game finally won over the great uncaring american audience to establish the game they loved
POD1000000039_S0000282	soccer long derided in the united states as a truly major league sport
POD1000000039_S0000284	and they blew it
POD1000000039_S0000286	we could be mercenary about this and say well they lost you know the commercials they lost the wheaties boxes they did they certainly lost all that but they also lost their pride
POD1000000039_S0000287	espn reporter
POD1000000039_S0000289	i mean they were a proud bunch of guys these guys you know it is a big country they were the best we had to offer pretty much
POD1000000039_S0000290	and they were terrible and they did not just lose they lost to iran and they finished last in the tournament 32nd out of 32nd
POD1000000039_S0000291	that is not what americans do that is not what we are accustomed to we do not lose like that
POD1000000039_S0000292	and the ramifications for soccer
POD1000000039_S0000293	as we found out you do not even get these chances every 4 years and when you get them you have to take advantage especially in a culture in which they are not paying attention
POD1000000039_S0000294	the rest of the time the way they are during that month and by going out in ignominious fashion humiliating fashion
POD1000000039_S0000296	i think this is in some ways usually too strong a word to apply to sports
POD1000000039_S0000298	this was disgraceful fashion they hurt soccer
POD1000000039_S0000300	so the damage to the profile of the game you had people watching
POD1000000039_S0000302	so i put that damage in excess of a $10
POD1000000039_S0000303	it is hank steinbrecher again
POD1000000039_S0000305	how long did it take you to get over 1998
POD1000000039_S0000307	0 i am not over it
POD1000000039_S0000309	i am not over it that was the lowest point of my career
POD1000000039_S0000311	i am not over it
POD1000000039_S0000313	you live with it
POD1000000039_S0000315	what mistakes did i make that affected that game
POD1000000039_S0000317	some people may not care as much as i did
POD1000000039_S0000319	but i care and we failed and i do not like the failure even though i know the
POD1000000039_S0000322	and nobody ever says this out loud but i am going to not until brandi chastain saved it in 1999 did we have a good feeling about the sport but the boys had blown it
POD1000000039_S0000323	we had really lost a lot of respect from the world and internally
POD1000000039_S0000325	in 1999 the us women is national team they exploded into america is consciousness one year after america is most dismal failure soccer once again was breakfast table conversation across america
POD1000000039_S0000326	because players like brandi chastain and mia hamm they were plastered all over our wheaties boxes
POD1000000039_S0000328	so yeah while it is dark that the us men failed to even qualify for the 2018 world cup worry not the us women will please god once again redeem themselves
POD1000000039_S0000330	at the 2019 world cup but ultimately it does not matter because america you have got to face it
POD1000000039_S0000331	soccer is here it is in your heart the honest truth is i can watch more soccer in the us than i ever could when i 1st arrived
POD1000000039_S0000332	remember back then i could only hear a big game in england by having my dad to hold up the phone to his own television back in liverpool
POD1000000039_S0000333	now i can watch the action from dozens of leagues from major to obscure and scream at them at my own television in my own home in new york city
POD1000000039_S0000335	and i am not alone 72000 people packed a stadium in atlanta this season to set an mls single game attendance record
POD1000000039_S0000336	and you know who set the 2 previous attendance records atlanta yes atlanta people

POD1000000040_S0000029	somebody popped but the confidentiality we do not know who but i do believe it was a false positive but we still have to do the 14 day obligatory shutdown
POD1000000040_S0000031	so yeah i mean it was great in the sense of everybody got an extended thanksgiving break but it just sucks because everything is put on pause
POD1000000040_S0000033	but there is not really a system that is put in place when being with what we are all going through right now with all these new rules and regulations and and and there is you know
POD1000000040_S0000034	how do you pay people in that break and how does it consider and so it is a bit of a shit show but i am you know i am glad everybody is healthy and okay
POD1000000040_S0000035	and we are going back to work on wednesday until we get the next false positive
POD1000000040_S0000036	yeah exactly
POD1000000040_S0000038	that is kind of what i wanted to talk about because on this show a few weeks ago we had mentioned that you guys were back to shooting a lot of people were asking us what the protocols and everything like that was for shooting now i have seen pictures from the set of like
POD1000000040_S0000039	blackish for example right
POD1000000040_S0000041	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000042	they are currently in and same with this is us they are currently in glass cubes of emotion where everybody is sealed off on set with some form of plexiglass
POD1000000040_S0000043	you are kind of studying your sides and lines behind the plexiglass and then they are calling in teams one by one and when i say teams usually starts with what
POD1000000040_S0000045	they got their job and then they move out and then the directors they move out and then you guys go in for blocking which is rehearsal and then move out is that is that happening to you guys too because i mean you guys are an action packed show like i just find it so difficult to imagine
POD1000000040_S0000046	it is you know at the beginning of the season when we came back we are all fired up to come back and you know you can not there is no hugging there is no nothing there is no like touching it is the weirdest thing and everybody is wearing masks the whole time
POD1000000040_S0000047	and we are broken up into the red team blue team and various different other teams that they have and then we come in last when everything is done we rehearse with our masks on
POD1000000040_S0000048	and then when they say action we take off do the scene then put our masks back on and then leave the area and then blue team comes in and then fix whatever adjustments
POD1000000040_S0000049	but if you are on red team you are getting tested 3 times a week
POD1000000040_S0000051	so monday wednesday friday or at least 72 hours before you show up to set for filming
POD1000000040_S0000052	so i am actually in route right now to go get my testing so maybe while we are doing this you will see something being stuck in my nose because i will do it live
POD1000000040_S0000054	let us do it
POD1000000040_S0000056	hey listen so i have got this script where it is basically just me spitting in people is mouths you telling me i can not get that made right now
POD1000000040_S0000058	i mean maybe for red tube or youpour
POD1000000040_S0000060	people are kink shaming right now
POD1000000040_S0000062	like one of my kinks is to walk around in public without a fucking mask on
POD1000000040_S0000063	yeah it is
POD1000000040_S0000065	yeah that is right i have jerked off in a lot of barnes and newell is bathrooms i will say that
POD1000000040_S0000067	so nipple clamps and no mask i mean that is you are onto something
POD1000000040_S0000068	just a light touch of electricity
POD1000000040_S0000069	yeah look cuomo has got nipple rings
POD1000000040_S0000070	he does yeah well he has got studs it looks through there
POD1000000040_S0000072	yeah it appears to be studs and not rings which i guess is another kink right
POD1000000040_S0000075	i do not know
POD1000000040_S0000076	cuomo the governor of new york
POD1000000040_S0000078	i saw that
POD1000000040_S0000079	yeah you never saw that picture
POD1000000040_S0000080	no
POD1000000040_S0000082	i will text it to you hang on a sec
POD1000000040_S0000083	yeah that explains a lot
POD1000000040_S0000084	a lot right
POD1000000040_S0000086	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000087	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000088	a lot he was wearing a white shirt kind of looked like a polo which is not conducive for nipple rings and you know he does what he does
POD1000000040_S0000089	and obviously we do not kink shame like we just said on the show but it is weird to see a 65 year old man with nipple rings yeah
POD1000000040_S0000091	i mean i wonder if that was a decision he made or if a woman talked him into it and if so what is up with a woman that wants to see a 65 year old with nipple studs
POD1000000040_S0000092	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000093	or maybe he just lost a bet

POD1000000040_S0000096	100%

POD1000000040_S0000118	we are only doing 14 but if you include the 2 hour premiere which is 2 episodes that we did not air last year because it was like the season ended on such like a weird note it was like
POD1000000040_S0000120	season finale but a lot of people you know did not understand understand did not understand the sort of the covid impact yet that we had to shut down so we could not finish filming and so the season ended
POD1000000040_S0000122	but i can tell you this that the season opener you know this tour for network tv is pretty damn good and i am really proud of it but yeah we are shooting 14 as opposed to 22 episodes

POD1000000040_S0000143	we are a big show and
POD1000000040_S0000145	you know cbs lost a lot of money due to like the ncaa and all sorts of stuff and you know they just they just did not know how to how we were going to do it one of the benefits for us is we shoot outside a lot
POD1000000040_S0000147	yeah you guys have a dope ass outdoor set yeah
POD1000000040_S0000148	yeah and then and then our our showrunner spencer and chris chulak really
POD1000000040_S0000149	kind of put their heads together and said look this is how we can adapt and overcome and we can create more
POD1000000040_S0000151	stories this way and because there was a huge budget cut to they are like you guys can come back but you can only do the show for this amount which was basically next to impossible like my name is almost half of the budget that we lost
POD1000000040_S0000152	as well
POD1000000040_S0000153	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000154	and
POD1000000040_S0000156	this season we have gotten more into the character stuff what is going behind mostly with these guys as opposed to these big action sequences
POD1000000040_S0000157	which i do not believe you could have really done in season one 2 maybe 3 but you were able to do that so i think every 2nd or 3rd episode there will be like a big action sequence there will be little ones here and there but we will have these big sort of blowouts
POD1000000040_S0000158	and it just being able to go deeper into the psychology of the guys and the families and what is sort of happening behind closed doors
POD1000000040_S0000159	and i do think that for what the hand that the writers have been dealt and sort of the unknown space that we are now working in
POD1000000040_S0000160	i think they really held it together we are actually shooting simos episode you guys know mark right
POD1000000040_S0000161	yeah yeah yeah
POD1000000040_S0000162	yeah he is probably one of my favorite writers on the show not just because he wrote the submarine episode but just i just think he is you know he is he is knows the world
POD1000000040_S0000164	anybody
POD1000000040_S0000165	that was a tough one for you i mean did you how long were you actually in that tube

POD1000000040_S0000233	yeah great great comedian one of the best stand up comedians of all time
POD1000000040_S0000234	did not he die of an od

POD1000000040_S0000240	is that better for you guys
POD1000000040_S0000241	yeah you are perfect right there you are perfect right there is your is not your wife like a 1st responder
POD1000000040_S0000243	yeah she is a nurse she worked in infectious disease for 10 or 11 years
POD1000000040_S0000244	0 shit
POD1000000040_S0000245	cedars and she got out of that when we had her right when we had her we found out we are expecting twins
POD1000000040_S0000246	because just what you had to deal with daily and becoming friends with patients and then what nurses deal with on the
POD1000000040_S0000248	how close they get with their patients and then when they pass it is really sort of hard on them
POD1000000040_S0000249	so and she was definitely it was affecting her and having to be there for 3 kids and it just emotionally by by
POD1000000040_S0000250	a good sit down i was like look there is other things we can do in the same field and she then fell in love with like derm so botox and lasers and all that sort of stuff and we had a friend that was at a clinic and she went over there and
POD1000000040_S0000251	and now she is that is what she does
POD1000000040_S0000252	that is awesome man do you ever sit down and talk to her about this this covid shit and just be like hey man this had to have been built in a lab somewhere like it does not make any sense at this point
POD1000000040_S0000253	it is yeah it is it is hard like there is there is 2 sides it is like there is some so big
POD1000000040_S0000255	infectious people that we have relationships with that are on the pathology side and that sit on boards and stuff
POD1000000040_S0000256	and what they have said when they have had to report which is a little unnerving is that any good news that they have told or positive stuff that they are on
POD1000000040_S0000258	you are beating others good numbers
POD1000000040_S0000259	is never reported
POD1000000040_S0000260	right now
POD1000000040_S0000261	there is never they are never talking about the good side of things and you know the success of what they are you know and you know
POD1000000040_S0000262	are you referring to the 99.98% of people who recover from this
POD1000000040_S0000263	yeah exactly i have personal friends who are on the verge of losing absolutely everything
POD1000000040_S0000264	and like their restaurants and businesses and like unrecoverable
POD1000000040_S0000266	they are so screwed and it is so heartbreaking the sense that the decision making in our state with gavin newsom
POD1000000040_S0000267	who you know i believe he is just
POD1000000040_S0000269	the guy is such a contradiction and such a piece of shit of what he has how he says you know we are in this together with that stupid smile on his face
POD1000000040_S0000270	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000271	and i have friends of mine who are barely holding on and have kids and if they were to get this they have the 99.86% survival
POD1000000040_S0000272	but by shutting down their restaurant again they have 100% chance of losing everything
POD1000000040_S0000273	right
POD1000000040_S0000274	100% chance of their kids being affected and their kids kids being affected by this because you know and there is just no there is no help
POD1000000040_S0000275	they are like hey go in and go in another lockdown but your mortgage is still due your payments for all your restaurants are still due everything else is 100% due but you got to go inside and help humanity
POD1000000040_S0000276	but while you help humanity we are going to fuck you it is like if they are like look taxes everything else is taking we are putting on pause and there is no you know we are shut down for 5 months
POD1000000040_S0000278	we are doing this to save humanity
POD1000000040_S0000279	yeah like 15 days
POD1000000040_S0000281	flatten the curve
POD1000000040_S0000283	the longest 15 days of my goddamn life
POD1000000040_S0000284	it is just conditioning you and grooming you for hey man that 15 days is going to turn into 30 that 30 is going to turn into 45 and then it is going to turn into 3 months and then 6 all of your businesses will shut down
POD1000000040_S0000286	hey but you still got to pay your taxes
POD1000000040_S0000288	and everybody that is telling us to fucking stay inside they are still getting paid money they are still getting paid a shit ton of fucking money
POD1000000040_S0000289	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000290	i mean newsome between him eating at that french laundry place when he was telling everybody to wear a mask him telling his kids
POD1000000040_S0000291	or telling the kids can not go to school but he sends his kids off to like montana or something to go to school and then during the shutdown his winery was the only winery that was allowed to stay open
POD1000000040_S0000292	right
POD1000000040_S0000293	so it is just it is just like i am sorry how the fuck is this guy there is just no the people in power are and there is too many of them that are do as we say
POD1000000040_S0000295	we do and they are all getting paid a shit ton of money and we are all told to sit back and fucking take it and if you do not you are shamed you are made a fool of and you have this other side of social media of like
POD1000000040_S0000296	you got to do what and it pisses me off too is like i wish more people would spend less times just reading headlines and more time actually just going to like
POD1000000040_S0000297	like the cdc or actually reading facts and just educating yourself on their realizing
POD1000000040_S0000298	that go to where the science is and not where the narrative is that needs to be pushed and maybe you will get
POD1000000040_S0000300	this is not saying
POD1000000040_S0000302	your democrat or republican and just be an american and do your research and stop being a sheep and just hearing one thing or just repeating what your friend said or just start shaming people because
POD1000000040_S0000303	you feel like that is what it is you need to do it is gotten to the point now especially here in la where everybody is you know the cancel culture and everybody is so fucking righteous about what they know
POD1000000040_S0000304	but then when you ask them about just basic things they are
POD1000000040_S0000306	they can not answer it because they do not do the research
POD1000000040_S0000307	no no one else yeah no one does and then even when you you know you think you have the answer like there was a 1st responder like outlook out of our 1030 listeners 80% of them are military and 1st responder right
POD1000000040_S0000308	so i got this text from a 1st responder that i would like to read here because here is what we are headed for he works in a major city all i will say is it is top 10 in america
POD1000000040_S0000309	city wise because i do not want to out him he is a he is a paramedic so he just got the word last night that he will be able to take the vaccine as early as up to next week
POD1000000040_S0000310	he is a paramedic he says it is the pfizer vaccine he says it will be 2 shots spaced apart by 2 weeks supposedly this is what they are telling him you are going to get sick for about 2 days
POD1000000040_S0000311	it has got to be stored in temperatures of -170 degrees celsius
POD1000000040_S0000312	holy shit
POD1000000040_S0000313	yes it can only be out of that temperature for 3 hours before going bad so they have to get it to you pretty quickly once it is taken like out of the freezer right now the reason why he wrote me this last night is is
POD1000000040_S0000314	here is what else he went on to say was and i said
POD1000000040_S0000316	you know how do you feel about taking this cause he is a 1st responder and what they are trying to do allegedly is give this to all the 1st responders 1st because obviously they are treating people every single day and they are dealing with covid patients and all that other shit and i go how do you feel about it and he is like well
POD1000000040_S0000317	well for some reason and i am just reading this verbatim here because he allowed me to he says for some reason they are going to keep this pretty hush hush the reality is there is no cure he said this he he personally believes
POD1000000040_S0000318	and this is what i wanted to ask you because your wife has worked in this field he says this is not going to stop covid 19 it will always be here it may take up years for us to build the immunity for it that is why there will never be a cure for hiv or the flu
POD1000000040_S0000319	it is a virus they mutate the strain that is here in the united states is not the same one that is in europe he said maybe one day it will be like the other corona viruses which which you know are basically just like the common cold
POD1000000040_S0000320	he says you know as a 1st responder this is a fucking shit show he is like i have been around this thing for every day since i have been working at the very beginning exposed to treating patients with it
POD1000000040_S0000321	so far i have not caught it nor do i have the antibodies and i do not know whether or not i want to take this vaccine because fuck it there is too much unknown about the vaccine that is currently coming out
POD1000000040_S0000322	and him personally as a 1st responder he is saying there is just not enough data that i would trust taking this thing
POD1000000040_S0000323	no there is no
POD1000000040_S0000325	definitely not i mean this thing was rushed
POD1000000040_S0000327	it takes 7 years minimum for for for any vaccine i mean i personally i have never got a flu shot before i have never i am not anti vaxxer like my kids have all been vaccinated but i like the flu shot you know i have always
POD1000000040_S0000328	and
POD1000000040_S0000329	i think it is a 94 point something
POD1000000040_S0000331	yeah so but again it is like do i tell her and then she has some sort of autoimmune like we just they have not there is just no data and this it is you know what is scary is like 1st they were like hey do yourself a favor and
POD1000000040_S0000332	for the good of society wear a mask please now they are like it is mandated
POD1000000040_S0000333	now it is like hey we got this vaccine hopefully you guys will take it and what i am worried is that they are going to be like they start saying well if you do not take it like with ticketmaster
POD1000000040_S0000335	that is exactly where i was going with this what if they say this to you hey man in order to come back and shoot you have got to take this vaccine
POD1000000040_S0000336	and i have got to go find another i got you know i am going to join you up on your podcast
POD1000000040_S0000337	yeah it is fine
POD1000000040_S0000339	we are hiring
POD1000000040_S0000341	we have more chairs in here and you are
POD1000000040_S0000343	i do not know i really i do not
POD1000000040_S0000344	there is unless you have got at least 2 to 3 years of stuff it is like if i have 99
POD1000000040_S0000345	99.96 or whatever the fuck it is of survival why do i need to do this and what the common sense thing ..
POD1000000040_S0000346	my wife and i have talked about this because the ward that she worked in during flu season
POD1000000040_S0000347	which was a coronavirus and if you look on the back of a lysol bottle right prior to any of this outbreak
POD1000000040_S0000348	look at the back of the lysol bottle it says kills coronavirus the flu has been the strand of this has happened in covid 19 during every flu season
POD1000000040_S0000349	they would take the immune compromise in the ward and they would
POD1000000040_S0000350	isolate them from they would limit the in and out of people coming in to see this war because they were fearful that if they got anything they would die kind of like what is happening right now except you still were able to go to work
POD1000000040_S0000352	and the thing that and somebody can prove me wrong on this is
POD1000000040_S0000354	are
POD1000000040_S0000356	death toll in america from 2000 and look at 2018 and 2019 of our our in total deaths
POD1000000040_S0000357	we are still less this year or maybe we could last time it could be a little higher or it could be even from the last year i think 2018 was a huge year
POD1000000040_S0000359	or 65000 people died of the flu i think
POD1000000040_S0000360	yeah so but we are still the numbers we are not way past what our regular death toll is for the entire country for the year so i am just it just i have never seemed to get the answer well
POD1000000040_S0000361	why is that though if this is a pandemic where we are exceeding our yearly death rate then why if we are not then pandemic usually is when you exceed it
POD1000000040_S0000362	so and it is i just it is there is so many unanswered questions i think everybody that is really questioning it and just looking at numbers is starting to go hold on a 2nd here this does not this does not make sense
POD1000000040_S0000363	and when someone then can not give you the answer back you are supposed to just shut up and you need a virtue signal with us and do what you are told and it is like that is why i am like well just give me the answer so i understand if you can provide the proper thing ..
POD1000000040_S0000364	and tell me based on fact and science i will comply but until you can and give me the reasons then i am not doing it and i am not going to let my kids do it and i am not i mean look at the schools that have been opened
POD1000000040_S0000365	have you heard of any deaths in schools
POD1000000040_S0000366	no no and my kids are in school right now and i have got you know i have got a 6 year old and a 2 year old both of them are in school they are fine you know as parents we get these emails or text messages if something bad happens obviously
POD1000000040_S0000367	kind of like everything else these days it is you know some app that comes to your phone or whatever 3 of my son is teachers have had coronavirus and i will get this email that says hey the teacher tested positive we have removed the teacher and
POD1000000040_S0000368	but the kids have stayed none of the kids have gotten coronavirus they are fine they have removed the teacher to quarantine for 14 days and then they come back and so far so good as far as school has gone but you know until we
POD1000000040_S0000369	come up with some form of plan to keep everybody working in the economy and kids in school and all this other shit man i do not know what is going to happen because you know i look at your industry in particular with
POD1000000040_S0000370	with hollywood right
POD1000000040_S0000371	you are you are hanging on by a thread as far as theatrical movies go right now yeah yeah no one will go to the theaters not not only because of of you know you are at 20% capacity or whatever it is
POD1000000040_S0000372	yeah and the theaters can not afford to stay open but also studios have pushed all of their movies until at least april or may of next year as far as being released into theaters so even if they were open there is nothing to put in them
POD1000000040_S0000373	i have got a theory
POD1000000040_S0000375	i would love to hear it
POD1000000040_S0000377	what i am ready this is less of a theory and more of like what if so what if
POD1000000040_S0000379	someone who is i do not know not a lefty and not a giant pussy decides to open their own theater and then that becomes the avenue for watching live shit
POD1000000040_S0000380	but then hollywood has to start pivoting towards the audiences that would go which are more conservative audiences
POD1000000040_S0000381	so does hollywood become conservative 20 years from now because the only audience they have left are conservatives who actually show up and watch it how funny would that fucking be
POD1000000040_S0000382	yeah you know and it is kind of look it is kind of happening in texas right now so dan and i have tickets to go see bill burr next weekend right
POD1000000040_S0000383	i have been to this venue before it holds about 2 to 3000 people you have to wear a mask to get in once you are in you take off that mask i was at a country concert there maybe 2 months ago right i saw girls there was a table full of girls
POD1000000040_S0000384	i
POD1000000040_S0000385	now the other thing that is sold out around here is driving movies and they are showing old movies and it is a blast if you have kids and all that stuff
POD1000000040_S0000386	we just went to one last it was a premiere of the croods and the 2nd croods it is actually great if you love nick cage who i am the biggest nick cage fan
POD1000000040_S0000387	everyone nick cage is a national treasure goddamn yeah he is
POD1000000040_S0000388	no no no pun intended
POD1000000040_S0000390	like him and ryan reynolds it is fucking brilliant and i highly recommend anybody to go see that movie
POD1000000040_S0000391	and
POD1000000040_S0000392	not like red carpet thing but you drive through and they had this whole light tunnel with all the characters it was just the pivot that they made to make that an experience for the kids
POD1000000040_S0000393	and you get your popcorn and stuff they had a blast and it was i enjoyed it i had gone to the drive in and it was my wife is 1st drive in
POD1000000040_S0000394	0 wow
POD1000000040_S0000395	so that was awesome so i mean if they can start doing that sort of stuff awesome the theaters can pivot and do that and still make their money
POD1000000040_S0000396	i think that is a great thing but just go back to something you said there about the kids that really concerns me is
POD1000000040_S0000398	these people do not understand or i do not think so they are putting the thought into we do not know how bad we are fucking up our kids by doing this
POD1000000040_S0000399	our kids learn and grow by being interactive and playing on the playground and wrestling and just being a kid
POD1000000040_S0000400	and there was this opportunity for like one of my daughters in a pod where 5 families got together and we hired this teacher and one of our friends had some space in their house so they created like you know classroom
POD1000000040_S0000401	5 kids taking the curriculum and just teaching it and they have had it has been the best thing ever for the kids because they are able just to see there and they do not have to wear masks and they have to do this and then the school system was like 0 we are going to allow you back
POD1000000040_S0000403	but everybody has to wear a mask all the time they are going to be 6 feet apart at all times if your child falls unfortunately our teachers can not go and pick them up or remove their mask i am like what what what
POD1000000040_S0000404	and i am like i am going to i am going to our kids already my daughter she knows what covid is but it is such a depressing word for her and like seeing my seeing my boys
POD1000000040_S0000405	you know you tell me i have to travel i have to wear these masks and then processing like this is you know it just it is heartbreaking like i just do not think the thought has been put into what damage we are creating what this
POD1000000040_S0000406	this hypochondriac ocd stuff about we are creating and weirdness of people if a child coughs and people are afraid it is like i would show up i remember picking my daughter up from montessori
POD1000000040_S0000407	and literally you would have to go back to this playground where they would be after school and this is 2 years ago 3 years ago and i walked up and she was literally licking the slide
POD1000000040_S0000408	and
POD1000000040_S0000409	there was no hand sanitizer and just build your immune system and like there is just not constantly hand sanitizing what we have got to get you have got to and even as adults you have to build up this for immunity to to do and hiding from
POD1000000040_S0000410	a disease is not dead if you look at the numbers at utah
POD1000000040_S0000412	and colorado right utah did not lock down in the way that colorado did and they have half the numbers of what colorado
POD1000000040_S0000413	yeah but utah is mormons they are not allowed to touch each other i do not think
POD1000000040_S0000415	but it is just like none of it makes sense and i think when you leave it to these governors to sort of use it as a sort of power hungry you know
POD1000000040_S0000416	way to control your there is going to be a you know there is already people i have heard a lot of people saying like if this continues there is there is going to be a pushback and it is going to be a big one
POD1000000040_S0000417	yeah there is only so much that you can do that what is so great about this country and i am an immigrant to this country and what is so great about this country is the ability to free speech and and and to
POD1000000040_S0000418	to live your life and i think when you start missing mixing politics with medicine it is a slippery slope that we go down and i and i really believe that you are taking away the fundamentals of why
POD1000000040_S0000419	this country is so great you are censoring people is speech you are putting rules and stuff where if you disagree and do not conform you will be penalized
POD1000000040_S0000420	it just pisses me off that people are not open to hearing when you say this is crazy as opposed to i am just going to follow and do what i am told
POD1000000040_S0000421	what where have you all gone how is it if you are vocal about .
POD1000000040_S0000423	 . something that then you are against it as opposed to just questioning to understand better so you can give me the proper facts so i can make the best decision based on looking at those facts
POD1000000040_S0000424	to for my family but you can not provide that so how can i make a decision so therefore i am going to keep questioning
POD1000000040_S0000425	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000426	and i think that is a disconnect that people do not understand because just conforming to facts that do not make sense i do not know how that is a good thing
POD1000000040_S0000427	yeah it is not i mean we are turning like you were talking about with the kids we are turning this whole generation into tony shalhoub and monk basically
POD1000000040_S0000429	going to be great detectives but they are going to be walking around with hand sanitizer afraid to touch things for the rest of their lives
POD1000000040_S0000430	and
POD1000000040_S0000432	what happens next year when there is like covid 20 and this like we have never done this before
POD1000000040_S0000433	no it is stupid
POD1000000040_S0000434	we are going to freak out every time there is a flu bug
POD1000000040_S0000435	you so we are going to take a look at some of the other
POD1000000040_S0000436	and we are just going to have that there is no the dust does not make sense there is no way in hell anybody in my family is taking that vaccine
POD1000000040_S0000437	i have been strong with my wife she agrees with it and you know if that is if it comes to that then but i think there is be more pushback of people that will not where they are like you are going to have to do this and i think more people are going to be like well then i am
POD1000000040_S0000438	you do not have like with ticketmaster ticketmaster can go fuck themselves and nobody will go to the concerts
POD1000000040_S0000440	okay go
POD1000000040_S0000442	so go do your go make your show somewhere else then because that is the rule they will not if it has to do with flying then i guarantee you somebody else will start a private sector of ..
POD1000000040_S0000443	you know whatever wheels up or thing we can fly on planes and or buses or whatever it is we are just there will be because there is enough people on on the side of question that will that have a fucking enough money to
POD1000000040_S0000444	adapt and pivot to make their own way of entertainment and travel
POD1000000040_S0000445	right
POD1000000040_S0000446	so
POD1000000040_S0000448	if we have been on this slippery slope for a number of years now probably 25 years where political correctness has robbed us of our ability to learn how to do conflict resolution particularly at a young age
POD1000000040_S0000450	in the face when you are 67 years old is a lesson or getting punched in the face
POD1000000040_S0000452	and you know what i mean
POD1000000040_S0000454	physical violence but being able to disagree with one another in public
POD1000000040_S0000456	where everybody is opinion is on the same level right
POD1000000040_S0000458	you can not shame me for any of this stuff and when you try you can get fucked frankly
POD1000000040_S0000460	i mean what other man it is so easy a very small percentage of the population is truly susceptible to this how much would it cost just to pay them and then pay other people to take care of them and let us all do what the fuck we are doing anyways
POD1000000040_S0000461	that would be way too much
POD1000000040_S0000463	cheaper than the fucking 7 to $80 we are going to end up spending on this
POD1000000040_S0000465	yeah and back to your thing about the child aggression
POD1000000040_S0000467	10
POD1000000040_S0000469	being shut down permanently
POD1000000040_S0000470	businesses like the child regression too and education and everything i host a show with my wife called ross patterson revolution tomorrow we are actually doing a serious show about this because our children are regressing
POD1000000040_S0000471	from this like i mean it is
POD1000000040_S0000472	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000473	completely changed them and the way that they view the world and like they are going backwards in life
POD1000000040_S0000475	just in learning but like in simple day to day things that like people are not really talking about and and that is going to have a longterm effect too not only on you know our economy but us as americans and like
POD1000000040_S0000476	our kids are going to get fucking dumber from all of this shit because
POD1000000040_S0000478	so many rules
POD1000000040_S0000479	over 40% of kids are not showing up for their zoom classes
POD1000000040_S0000481	of kids are not getting their education right now
POD1000000040_S0000482	yeah and
POD1000000040_S0000484	and because the parents and it is not the parents fault the parents if they are a single mom or something they have got to go out and they have got to work to hold on to whatever they got to feed their kids
POD1000000040_S0000485	you know and and then the kids are say here is a zoom thing and the kids are like yeah yeah i would rather not do that so there is no there is just no support
POD1000000040_S0000486	and it is and again i do not know how they have thought that it was going to work that you are like yeah they have got to homeschool do these zoom classes but you as a parent have to ..
POD1000000040_S0000487	still work it is like who are writing these i just i literally i am so dumbfounded at some of the stuff that there is just no common sense put into this
POD1000000040_S0000488	and if this is what what it is what is what is that that analogy with the frog in the water where if you throw a frog into hot water right away it will jump out but if you put a frog into the water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will die
POD1000000040_S0000489	right
POD1000000040_S0000491	and
POD1000000040_S0000492	and
POD1000000040_S0000493	and there is no pushback and then all of a sudden you go on a trip and it is an extra $300 $400 when you get to the gate to check in because your bags
POD1000000040_S0000494	but you know it is the same thing with this we slowly are just they are just adding this and adding this and taking away and taking away and the one thing with government when they take something away they fucking giving it back yeah that is never coming back
POD1000000040_S0000496	julius caesar whenever you take power it very rarely gets given back to the people and that is a problem that is why america was started in the 1st place we do not like rulers around here we do not like being told what to do
POD1000000040_S0000497	particularly by people who do not live the same type of lives that we do i mean what does gavin newsom have to tell me about living my day to day life hair gel and teeth whitener is that what he is going to teach me about how about you get fucked gavin

POD1000000040_S0000642	so it was but we had i have just been out there and seen his land and you know being around the group of people that i was i was like that is good sort of the switch for me i had told my wife i am like read this text this is just so much fun here
POD1000000040_S0000643	i know there is a ton of distilleries are you the one who has got a partner are you with artie baxter and a company
POD1000000040_S0000645	so after you were on the show last time and we started messaging on instagram and all that stuff i saw pictures with artie and i did not know i did a movie with artie baxter back in the day and he is a great guy
POD1000000040_S0000647	he was then accepted
POD1000000040_S0000648	yeah okay so artie is the godfather to my twins we are best friends
POD1000000040_S0000649	yes
POD1000000040_S0000650	and
POD1000000040_S0000651	tell us about your company
POD1000000040_S0000652	yeah we started like 56 years ago we started a company called paperclip and it is a diaper bag company we had when i my wife was
POD1000000040_S0000653	i just had willow i took willow to go see my boys i took her out for the 1st time and went to go see my boys at the pink taco on sunset boulevard to watch some football
POD1000000040_S0000654	and as i pulled up my daughter had that explosive poop that went up her back which i still do not know how kids do that it shoots up their back
POD1000000040_S0000656	and so i am like rushing in and i am panicking and i am going to the bathroom and there was no changing table and i was just like 0 shit where is the changing table and the guy was like yeah we do not have changing tables in men is bathrooms
POD1000000040_S0000657	and so i go back in and then i forgot like the diaper pad thing that we got at the baby shower so to like take my shirt off and like lay it down on this like dirty floor and like changing it at this and it was just one of these like i failed of a moment father but as it was
POD1000000040_S0000658	i was like what if you had a diaper bag that had a foldout section that was a table and i had artie and i had been hanging out his wife was pregnant and he had called me
POD1000000040_S0000659	and i was like had a few cocktails and i was sketching out on this like a napkin and i was like dude there is you know there is none out there and there is like we did not want to come up with a bag that was like we knew that you know we were going to be like you know
POD1000000040_S0000661	the moms would still buy it but we wanted to look where a dad would carry it because every diaper bag had all these flower prints and all this sort of stuff so we flew to china did a bunch of prototypes
POD1000000040_S0000662	i ended up going to this baby show in vegas which is the abc show it is the biggest baby show in the world where you get to shake hands with all the big box we just went there for r d to understand what the market was and who we were up against
POD1000000040_S0000663	and we literally had prototypes and on the 2nd day we got a blue ribbon from the mommy bloggers and that was like the biggest award there it was the best innovation
POD1000000040_S0000664	and we are like what and they are like yeah you guys want them like holy like we did not we did not know what we had but like this is great and our patent actually just came through
POD1000000040_S0000665	about 6 months ago which is a really cool thing because i do not know how many times i have
POD1000000040_S0000666	and
POD1000000040_S0000667	sorry a year and a half ago we moved our stuff to indonesia and we found this factory that makes the best fabric it feels like a tumi fabric almost
POD1000000040_S0000668	and it is all recycled plastic so we pivoted to make our entire line recycled plastic and we are the 1st diaper bag in the world to be recycled plastic
POD1000000040_S0000669	each year we have won either by peel magazine or some sort of thing as best diaper bag out there if you go to papercliplife com i know we are actually having a huge cyber monday
POD1000000040_S0000670	sale today we check it out each one of the bags names like is named after one of our kids like the willow
POD1000000040_S0000672	is it based on how much they shit and how much room you need
POD1000000040_S0000673	pretty much
POD1000000040_S0000674	well willow takes some big dumps so .
POD1000000040_S0000675	she dropped a big load but yeah so it is honestly it is blown up for us i have said this before i never thought i would be playing a navy seal on tv and selling diaper bags
POD1000000040_S0000676	to
POD1000000040_S0000677	so it has been cool to see it explode in the way that it has especially with the road that we have been on and truly i got to tell you if it was not for artie and his day to day
POD1000000040_S0000678	he is running that and his sort of ideas he is i would say if it was not for his focus on that we the company would not be where we are today it is just it is unbelievable what what he is able to
POD1000000040_S0000679	to done so to do and you know where we got into nordstrom is and a couple other bigger stores we should be just depending with this covert stuff we should be in in the beginning of the next quarter
POD1000000040_S0000680	so it is kind of exploded on us it is exceeded pre covid we were on track our 1st sort of 3 months of last year sorry this year prior to covid
POD1000000040_S0000681	sold more than any of the years prior it was just like it was on a huge sort of bell curve trajectory and we are still doing it just delays with this but once we get each shipment that we come in they they just sell out
POD1000000040_S0000682	so
POD1000000040_S0000683	any thought of going on like shark tank dan and i have had a couple friends on shark tank
POD1000000040_S0000684	and
POD1000000040_S0000685	sales campaign and whatnot but diaper bags or baby product in general are sold in the playground if another mom says hey i recommend this then that mom goes out and gets it like instantly
POD1000000040_S0000686	so it is just a slow burn with baby product and word of mouth and i can tell you because it is designed by dads and our wives who play a big part in sort of the design
POD1000000040_S0000687	and
POD1000000040_S0000688	and
POD1000000040_S0000689	it has been a crazy journey and we have almost lost the company due to the china stuff and a bunch of other things
POD1000000040_S0000690	but we have managed just to pivot and find a way to succeed and it is thriving right now
POD1000000040_S0000691	if i can make one recommendation put a camelback bladder in there so dads can put booze in that thing
POD1000000040_S0000693	got to have a bota bag inside of there for the boom
POD1000000040_S0000694	it is a slot for a box wine yeah
POD1000000040_S0000695	just just just actually like a little what they call bungee cord that you can snap on a box line yeah why not
POD1000000040_S0000696	you know look i am waiting for a white call to make juice boxes yeah or is it sell a sell a sell a helmet that comes with it
POD1000000040_S0000697	yeah a nice little beer helmet 2 full wine bottles
POD1000000040_S0000698	i like it they keep going yeah i know artie is doing well i saw him on one of those on bravo he was selling his house on that thing and i was like 0 shit
POD1000000040_S0000699	he just moved to arizona
POD1000000040_S0000700	0 he did a lot of people remember him
POD1000000040_S0000701	yeah he moved to arizona which is another place that we looked at as well and but yeah he just moved out he got an insane like just a gorgeous place for what would have been like $50 easy in california he got that for
POD1000000040_S0000702	a quarter of the price
POD1000000040_S0000703	0 yeah easily i mean arizona is an interesting state i mean i guess they certified for biden today so it technically is a blue state this year but .
POD1000000040_S0000704	you can basically fire a machine gun into the side of a mountain there and nobody cares
POD1000000040_S0000705	really

POD1000000040_S0000746	and
POD1000000040_S0000747	i am going to use my platform in this space and understand how to leverage that to raise money and what people i should work with because there is unfortunately a lot of shady people out there that
POD1000000040_S0000748	take advantage and the dollars actually do not get to the veterans but gary sinise is the real gold standard and does so much for everyone so this is a charity that i have actually worked with firsthand
POD1000000040_S0000749	and i am really excited to partner with mikey and sam and forge clothing and money is going to go to a very good cause of helping vets and that is the gary sinise foundation
POD1000000040_S0000750	yeah gary sinise has done more for veterans than any living american probably
POD1000000040_S0000752	on an interesting they were doing a story on him the other day on tv and they were like you know what is funny about gary sinise is after it is all said and done and he has left this earth he will be remembered for helping veterans more than him as an actor
POD1000000040_S0000754	and helping veterans
POD1000000040_S0000755	yeah
POD1000000040_S0000756	i would argue i mean dude if you think about a guy who is i mean just dedicated his life to helping veterans like it is it is
POD1000000040_S0000757	literally his life and it has been amazing to see and i they were not wrong i was shit was on abc the other day and i was like man
POD1000000040_S0000758	the amount of time and effort and money he has raised is insane they did a half hour special on them and i was enthralled i was like
POD1000000040_S0000759	and he does not he is so invested like and i have gone down to the hospitals with him and just when people when you meet the families there that he is built the houses for and
POD1000000040_S0000760	and he does this stuff without a camera there or it is just that he just does this and is you know guys coming home that need those that have lost a leg and they need a whole reform of their house and he will
POD1000000040_S0000761	literally go in there and by the time they are out of the hospital everything is set up and there for them so that they at least have that battle of adjusting back to life in front of their kids and
POD1000000040_S0000762	that there is that other assistance there of the simple things in life of opening the dishwasher or just getting stuff out of the cupboard and being a part of the family
POD1000000040_S0000763	which i did not think about before i started sitting down and talking with gary i am like 0 my god he is like yeah that is one thing that we can help with is just that adjustment back in there where you do not feel that extra shame or whatever it is that
POD1000000040_S0000764	he takes that 1st initial shock at least to help them adjust and the homes these tech homes that he is done are state of the art
POD1000000040_S0000765	so i mean sometimes it is a brand new home like you will just say screw it and it is you know 4 or 5000 square foot house with everything that you could imagine for these guys these men and women and you know and i have done some work with him on the with the with the 5 the gold star
POD1000000040_S0000766	families and the kids and that he does a snowball express thing every year with the kids the guy is just is the best person in this space and just a great guy someone i really care about and
POD1000000040_S0000768	really proud to call a friend and extremely proud to partner with them and help raise money because i know every dollar does go to the families

POD1000000041_S0000061	that is for all the starbucks screenwriter crap
POD1000000041_S0000063	okay so what happened you saw a pile of leaves and knowing you i know what you like to do you always you can not resist jumping into a dead pile of leaves with your naked body so what happened
POD1000000041_S0000065	let us just say i went out wearing nothing but a rake and i saw a pile of dead leaves and so i was wondering because like i picked them up
POD1000000041_S0000066	and because i was moving them out of my way and i am like 0 they looks like poison ivy and apparently 5 days after poison ivy is dead it still has it is the oil on poison
POD1000000041_S0000068	and the oil is still a threat during that time period i was fine you know
POD1000000041_S0000069	i am sorry
POD1000000041_S0000071	i made a joke and then you said something that actually struck me as even more odd is that you had to move them out of your way what are you talking what was what are you talking you were

POD1000000041_S0000075	and i moved them out of the way with my hands and did not make a difference because i do not know how to play golf yet but those leaves are gone and they were dead dead as a doornail

POD1000000041_S0000108	i need to find small businesses to send my christmas gifts from and i would prefer them to be black owned so now i am like on a full hunt to find like black owned businesses that i can send gifts from
POD1000000041_S0000110	how is the hunt going and do you have without giving anything away have you had success what are we looking at for christmas gift
POD1000000041_S0000112	we are finding some cute places we are finding some candles we are finding some soaps the issue is is that amazon gets things to the girls in 2 days
POD1000000041_S0000114	you know jeff bezos murdering ass is going to have your gifts on time
POD1000000041_S0000115	so i am like okay i think like with smaller businesses especially during a pandemic especially when the usps has been so severely damaged by the underfunding i am like okay how far ahead do i need to order
POD1000000041_S0000116	right now
POD1000000041_S0000118	yeah
POD1000000041_S0000120	i am like 0 panic because i need to order like 40 gifts now so
POD1000000041_S0000121	yeah that is the only issue but it is still going good but i am trying to buy small i hope people are buying small this year especially because god damn this was a hard year for small businesses
POD1000000041_S0000122	0 yeah i think the other the the thing with amazon too is half the time if you just figure out what the product is just go to the website of the product the manufacturer and chances are they are already having some kind of deal
POD1000000041_S0000124	if you want some just get it from the brand you know there is a way around it and you know what maybe you have to wait 3 days 4 days remember that remember the days we used to wait weeks
POD1000000041_S0000126	for ardelia is orders to arrive
POD1000000041_S0000128	come on delius
POD1000000041_S0000129	come on now
POD1000000041_S0000131	why did why did cody ziegler i know you all know him he he tweeted me a couple days ago and was like i just remembered going through my emails at least he had 3 different facebook accounts and i did with 3 different photos i still do
POD1000000041_S0000133	and i think i might have 4 now but the reason was because i was shopping at toby and delia is and they would be like 50% off if you give us your facebook
POD1000000041_S0000135	so i put on my ski mask and was like
POD1000000041_S0000137	they say
POD1000000041_S0000138	they say this is they say you meant late
POD1000000041_S0000140	i feel like based on the as i keep reminding our listeners i am watching the crown 456 episodes in
POD1000000041_S0000142	and i think the way that we are going to get out of this amazon thing is a amazon truck needs to hit and kill somebody who the president or
POD1000000041_S0000144	because that is the only way london got out of their deadly fog was because some pretty young girl who worked for winston churchill spoiler alert got
POD1000000041_S0000145	you know that was made up right yeah yeah that was one of the few things that was made up
POD1000000041_S0000147	that is the episode that almost made me give up on the show but .
POD1000000041_S0000149	yeah they do a lot of stuff to make winston churchill and the conservatives seem
POD1000000041_S0000150	okay i am not totally feeling that the politics of the crown i am back on board for watching it but the politics are bad

POD1000000041_S0000239	and we are back let us talk about some ideas for police reform that are being put forward in california there is a bill being discussed that is kind of incrementalist
POD1000000041_S0000240	in the way that basically all of the ideas for police reform that are endorsed by the police are tend to be but yeah this one
POD1000000041_S0000241	is basically saying that becoming a cop should require you to have a bachelors degree
POD1000000041_S0000242	and be 25 years old just based on statistics about what police officers with those attributes how violent they are versus otherwise
POD1000000041_S0000243	yeah the legislator who is putting it who is who wrote the bill is referring to like this study in 2010 that that basically says that college educated officers typically typically
POD1000000041_S0000245	typically use less force often and fewer complaints filed against them
POD1000000041_S0000246	now okay that is good thing to identify that group of people but this is you know like we are saying this is incremental change when we know what the real issues are
POD1000000041_S0000247	but you know this is not the issue here and like the reason this bill is coming out is not because we have a problem with you know not enough cops who studied abroad in barcelona
POD1000000041_S0000249	we have real issues here this is an issue within policing that is anti black anti poor anti fucking everything and they are protected by powerful unions
POD1000000041_S0000250	that can keep any kind of real meaningful legal repercussions from ever getting close to them as well as the financial consequences
POD1000000041_S0000251	via these like ridiculous retirement plans a lot of these people have where it is like dude you get fired and then you are fucking set like no matter what even if you straight up murder somebody twice
POD1000000041_S0000252	i and this is just you know these are the kinds of things that you wish the legislators were actually looking at because this is a good way of a legislator being like
POD1000000041_S0000253	well this is an improvement yes that would be great because right now you just need to be i think like 18 or have a equivalent like 18 with an equivalent in a high school diploma to begin your training
POD1000000041_S0000254	and it can be i think 20 if you are in the california highway patrol but yes this is that is a good way to try and weed out other people but it is really a disingenuous attempt at real reform
POD1000000041_S0000255	and we just need to look at how much money is going to these departments and actually just having this conversation about reinvesting in communities because the perception in law enforcement in this country is
POD1000000041_S0000256	well people commit crime because they are black rather than seeing the full picture of how black and brown americans have been abandoned and we are merely just branding this failure of governance as crime
POD1000000041_S0000257	you know it is not 0 it is crime it is not we failed these people they have no recourse they are so desperate that they commit crime people commit crimes out of desperation
POD1000000041_S0000258	you know 9 times out of 10 there are some people who just do it for the jollies but let us be real like a lot of this is about survival like you deal drugs not because you get a kick out of dealing drugs you do it because that is only employment available to you
POD1000000041_S0000259	that has the kind of income that you are looking for unfortunately or things other things like that gang people do not want to be in gangs like this is all these are all you know fact these are all byproducts of this failure
POD1000000041_S0000260	and i just want to also point out that this study that the legislator is using to say like 0 yeah look check this out like you know people who have been to france in college you know murder less
POD1000000041_S0000261	it was done by the national police foundation which i just want to point out that they love community policing like solutions and they love putting forward the broken window policing strategy
POD1000000041_S0000262	which is totally fucked up and completely wrong and backwards and biased so it is already like you know it is we have an imperfect thing drawing from an imperfect place trying to
POD1000000041_S0000263	you know be presented as you know meaningful change so it is just i think just we will continue to see things like this that look good and are good but i think are avoiding what all the outcries were from the public over this last year
POD1000000041_S0000264	over what is necessary to change the relationship between the community and law enforcement
POD1000000041_S0000265	yeah
POD1000000041_S0000266	yeah i mean i grew up in the city of chicago went to chicago public schools very diverse schools and all that and i can not tell you enough
POD1000000041_S0000267	there are people who i have met and who i have known a little and they are like 0 i am becoming a cop and in my head i am like they are letting you become a cop
POD1000000041_S0000269	they are allowing that
POD1000000041_S0000270	and i am like i am like what and so i do not it is like there is so much about character and personality that matters i think with becoming a cop that i do not know what kind of thing you could create to
POD1000000041_S0000271	figure that out of how you get the best character and personality to become a cop because it is it is it is it is a humanity job it is dealing with people
POD1000000041_S0000273	empathy for people like you need to have empathy for people you need to want to work for people
POD1000000041_S0000274	i think even to your point about like the character that of you know of the kinds of officers that need to be out there on the street is i think you start that by just having like reinforcing the fucking rules
POD1000000041_S0000275	so the ones who do not act with humanity in mind are quickly just booted the fuck out
POD1000000041_S0000277	known to people it is like yo yo this is not the place like if you want to fuck around and do that go to florida or whatever fucking other you know police department but i think for police departments this whole idea of like
POD1000000041_S0000278	well a couple of bad apples or whatever it is like well then toss out all the fucking bad apples then
POD1000000041_S0000280	and then see what you are left with and then figure out what the real problem is but there is no even sort of the energy for that is not even there so we get all these sort of like half measures that
POD1000000041_S0000281	have the like on paper are police reforms but we are we are well and we are way past the time for these small things like those things should have been 60 years ago if you want to like start that little incremental process but
POD1000000041_S0000282	now we are looking at the situation and we need to extinguish
POD1000000041_S0000284	100%
POD1000000041_S0000285	yeah i mean the more you know about history like that is that seems to be something that you
POD1000000041_S0000286	it is not just that black communities are abandoned it is that they are actively imprisoned through redlining in communities
POD1000000041_S0000287	where the official government policy is to deprive them of resources and then their only interaction with the state
POD1000000041_S0000288	10 year old who is riding by on his bike his only interaction with the state is violent racist police like it is it is not a problem that can be addressed through incremental change
POD1000000041_S0000290	what is something from your search history that is revealing about who you are
POD1000000041_S0000291	i recently googled if hamsters can chew on palo santo
POD1000000041_S0000293	like for them to if it is safe for them
POD1000000041_S0000295	that is the most like silver lake google thing i have ever heard in my life i think if you do not know what palo santo is like it is if you have ever if wherever you are in the country if you have some crunchy friends who are like seemingly just lighting a shard of wood on fire and
POD1000000041_S0000297	the vibe in here is so great super producer nick stumpf famously kept his control room just just piping with the palo santo smoke so
POD1000000041_S0000299	is it safe though
POD1000000041_S0000300	there is negative energy it is a sagey apparently palo santo is canceled though is what i have heard
POD1000000041_S0000301	palo santo is canceled
POD1000000041_S0000303	i think like white people like myself who are like can i answer to audit
POD1000000041_S0000305	do not let them have it we are taking it back nuh
POD1000000041_S0000307	pretty damn good i think it smells
POD1000000041_S0000309	it over sage for sure
POD1000000041_S0000310	okay
POD1000000041_S0000311	yeah
POD1000000041_S0000312	yeah any like place where there are selling crystals is like that is what you like which only gave way to sage which gave way to apollo santo right now
POD1000000041_S0000314	you know go to your local crystal shop if you do not know that is it probably smell like palo santo in there
POD1000000041_S0000316	okay
POD1000000041_S0000317	i will do that the 2nd that i am going to make a beeline for that the 2nd this lockdown is lifted
POD1000000041_S0000318	or like musicians especially love it i think that is why nick had it too because i have never been like with
POD1000000041_S0000320	musicians who if you were playing with them or in a session or like a rehearsal where they were just like let me just get the apollo gone a little bit
POD1000000041_S0000322	that is why it is such a sober like thing in my mind because like so many rehearsal spaces just smelled like weed like pabst and you know palo santo
POD1000000041_S0000324	allison how are you enjoying your polis on are you like lighting a is it just like a stick that you light always
POD1000000041_S0000325	it is literally it is like do i have it on me no it is literally just like a stick
POD1000000041_S0000326	yeah
POD1000000041_S0000327	yeah it is the most uninteresting thing to see
POD1000000041_S0000329	really good clears negative energy if you are into that stuff but i have a pet hamster and he needed a new chew toy and i was like
POD1000000041_S0000330	i am you know post recovery surgery mode and i am like well i have palo santo like
POD1000000041_S0000332	leave me alone
POD1000000041_S0000333	yeah like give you something to entertain yourself with but i ultimately decided not to even though i could not find a straight answer on palo santo specifically it seemed like it might be too risky of a wood for a hamster
POD1000000041_S0000334	would you pivot to
POD1000000041_S0000335	i ended up just waiting and i ended up just waiting and asked my sister to go to petco for me and she got
POD1000000041_S0000336	there you go
POD1000000041_S0000337	pencil shaped wood chew things
POD1000000041_S0000339	should have experimented with the palo santo maybe it would have changed the whole vibe of the hamster
POD1000000041_S0000341	sir hamster chew toys just just would that kind of
POD1000000041_S0000343	hamsters forever so do not get me started but if they are very finicky fragile creatures and i do not understand why we sell them to like 5 year olds like that is right okay
POD1000000041_S0000344	they are actually very high maintenance animals and even like the type of wood they choose is important because some wood is poisonous to them and other wood is not
POD1000000041_S0000346	is bad for them like stuff like that that makes sense yeah like they can choke on some and not on others or like some are like poison i do not know basically so yeah it matters what kind of wood do they chew
POD1000000041_S0000348	for the record you know alison is on her stenographer is keyboard right now
POD1000000041_S0000350	finally i want to talk about a story that would have i do not know it is it seems like it is way too important to cover in 3 minutes which we are going to try and do but
POD1000000041_S0000352	the former head of israel is what is his official title
POD1000000041_S0000354	there is no .
POD1000000041_S0000355	he is not some guy with a cool twitter handle that you know bb nett and yahoo like fucks with it is like you know he is he is i think he was running it from like the 80s to like 2010 or something yeah
POD1000000041_S0000357	for context he is saying if i had come up with what i am saying today 5 years ago i will get 20 saying i would have been hospitalized wherever i have gone with this in academia they have said the man is lost his mind today
POD1000000041_S0000358	they are already talking differently i have nothing to lose i have received my degrees and awards i am respecting universities abroad where the trend is also changing that trend he says that
POD1000000041_S0000359	we have made alien contact the us government and israel in particular that we are in communication and in fact in a legal contract with the extraterrestrials
POD1000000041_S0000360	and i mean i am glad of the one of his quotes i am glad that the aliens respect contract law
POD1000000041_S0000362	i said quote there is an agreement between the us government and the aliens they signed a contract with us to do experiments here
POD1000000041_S0000363	they too are researching and trying to understand the whole fabric of the universe and they want us as helpers
POD1000000041_S0000365	i just signed a contract is where it goes a little too far i was on board agreement maybe
POD1000000041_S0000366	you know contract with it with a red lining did they get the lawyers involved are the are the alien legal counsel there like sorry this is actually a poison pill in this deal
POD1000000041_S0000367	we will not do it if it is if it is contained in the contract language i do not but they are saying one of the 1st hubs of cooperation is a base on mars where by the way
POD1000000041_S0000368	astronauts have already set foot american astronauts and the base is underground that is why you can not see it
POD1000000041_S0000369	i love aliens i do too my uncle has a $10000 telescope in new hampshire and he was showing me jupiter up close i have said this before i will say it again if i have a family 6 kids
POD1000000041_S0000370	i need to be there for my family and aliens come to me and say hey we will take you with us you can never come back here see anybody again but you get to see the galaxy for what it is i would be like let us go
POD1000000041_S0000372	i would go okay i do not want to prolog with that but i will say this guy lost me when he plugged his book
POD1000000041_S0000374	it is like you do not want this guy is book though you know even like as a thing of like if he was talking that real shit he is like you know it is so complex like to say it use the word agreement would completely betray the forms of communication these life forms use
POD1000000041_S0000375	i would be like whoa okay but when you are treating it like a fucking like just you know a funny comedy film or the aliens like hey let us collab on some research fam
POD1000000041_S0000377	and then even like his explanation it is like where you all been where the aliens been what is going on
POD1000000041_S0000378	he mentioned trump in there too
POD1000000041_S0000379	yeah he did say that trump was on the verge of revealing all this but the aliens in the galactic federation which is literally a term from star trek but maybe not
POD1000000041_S0000380	aliens in the galactic federation are saying wait let everyone calm down 1st they do not want to start mass hysteria they want to 1st make us sane and understanding
POD1000000041_S0000381	so here is what like obviously i want to believe and i am going to always err on the side of yeah this could be possible the thing about the contract
POD1000000041_S0000382	so what my theories on aliens is that they might end up being a lot more similar to us than we expect them to be because of parallel evolution
POD1000000041_S0000383	and the fact that like when you look in australia at like the wildlife that evolved there and it like looks almost identical to wildlife that evolved independently in the u s it is like
POD1000000041_S0000384	when you have the conditions of life in 2 seemingly different places they do end up cohering similarly
POD1000000041_S0000385	so i do not know like maybe maybe that is something that eventually always comes up in when there is a civilization that has evolved to a certain point maybe like we got have contracts man
POD1000000041_S0000387	then nothing separates us from the single celled organisms
POD1000000041_S0000389	but i also just like picturing the process of getting from respected in academic circles has this hugely powerful career and now
POD1000000041_S0000390	what makes like just selling books just being like yeah i could it just seems i do not know i had i have a hard time
POD1000000041_S0000391	imagining that evolution like unless he was always all along like had some suspicion that there was alien contact like
POD1000000041_S0000392	he just keeping his mouth shut because it was going to cost him his job all the time they are like dude you got to knock that shit off
POD1000000041_S0000394	and he is just using like the same shit that ufo heads in the us use
POD1000000041_S0000395	like i am just saying roswell though dog look at this viral video
POD1000000041_S0000397	dude what about that beam of light above tel aviv that just shot up in the sky what was that they have it from multiple angles it is like that was doctored we already talked about this doctor
POD1000000041_S0000399	i wonder if too like yeah like at a certain point you know this is like his like breaking bad like kind of thing was like fuck it i got nothing
POD1000000041_S0000401	and get a book deal and get my little check so i can you know just buy my retirement cabin and live life comfortably because my government pension is running out so i have got to exploit that position to say some wild alien shit
POD1000000041_S0000402	i do not know that would be a smart move though because instantly right like it is a it is this is been a global headline because of because of the position you the pedigree like
POD1000000041_S0000403	just if so if you just have that former title to give you any authority keep in mind anybody in any position with authority you can do this
POD1000000041_S0000404	come out with some outlandish shit that will just be like upend the general accepted knowledge of your industry and people are like what the former head of what said what but this huh and then people will laugh you out but you will get your little shine
POD1000000041_S0000405	yeah so you are you are officially on a this guy is lost it or is just trying to sell books shit
POD1000000041_S0000407	i love that i love the energy of someone who is going to like completely change the game on us like this and be like no you all not listening they have signed a fucking contract ok and trump almost fucked it all up
POD1000000041_S0000408	and then the aliens were like nah fam just dead that for a 2nd because the people are not ready for us to do our grand reveal so if you could just sit on that we would appreciate that and donald trump was like bet
POD1000000041_S0000409	and you know that is basically who our president is he respects the you know agency of the
POD1000000041_S0000411	it is like it is also tough though too because we are we are we are like having this conversation in society right now about believing the scientists
POD1000000041_S0000413	like this guy is an academic super respected he ran their space program so this is somebody who we should
POD1000000041_S0000414	buy into right we should say like guys
POD1000000041_S0000415	well i need like for something like this it is like yo you need i need you to bring another few friends with you the ratios are not good here
POD1000000041_S0000417	i need better ratios i need like 5 other people who like you all can actually be like yo yo okay we are not going to tell you all but that one mission look into that and then i would be like 000
POD1000000041_S0000419	if the aliens are out there trying to get us to be more reasonable you know i am just saying where did this vaccine come from it is all of a sudden we got a vaccine that is 90% accurate or effective come on dude you think the aliens did not give that to us
POD1000000041_S0000420	what the fuck did you think i was talking about when i said operation warp speed
POD1000000041_S0000422	i was doing deals in fucking zebulon 369 z
POD1000000041_S0000423	there is no way he would be able to not brag about that
POD1000000041_S0000425	actually brokering this deal 0 my god
POD1000000041_S0000426	because he is going to do we have heard about his negotiating tactics he is going to be in there he is like nice to meet you alien people i am surprisingly calm in this negotiation but i just want to shut up by saying fuck you and he walks out
POD1000000041_S0000428	shit all right let us take a quick break and we will be right back
POD1000000041_S0000430	we would like to give thanks to the nurses america relies on at verizon helping nurses connect with their families is the least we can do that is why we are giving more to those who give the most

POD1000000041_S0000439	he is taking his talents and burger restaurant to a new location inside harrods in london and what is on the menu a $106 burger
POD1000000041_S0000441	our point of view in the united states it seems like absolutely ridiculous i know in the uk too things are not that great and last i checked harrods is not open so i do not know when you were going to even go into this restaurant to eat this burger
POD1000000041_S0000442	but just to let you know how you get to $106 the extravagant patty is a wagyu burger apparently featuring apparently okay interesting
POD1000000041_S0000444	wait hold on this is a scam
POD1000000041_S0000446	than a $100 burger
POD1000000041_S0000447	this shit needs to be unequivocal this is it is it undeniably has to be this 100% uk heritage beef patty seared wagyu sirloin fresh black truffles and truffle pecorino cheese
POD1000000041_S0000448	i can see they are like $40
POD1000000041_S0000449	i do not know why they even why even put a press release out it is going to anger people like you want to talk about your luxury burger in the time of like the global depression but
POD1000000041_S0000450	he did read the room on the other side because he is entering the seltzer game also and it is called wait for it hell is seltzer
POD1000000041_S0000452	i mean the seltzer game is getting crowded i will tell you that it is getting crowded
POD1000000041_S0000453	at this point you need a good name you know it is coming down to cuz they all cost about the same they all basically taste like shit so it is really coming down to a name game for me what is the deal with health cell

POD1000000041_S0000457	the website that is like doing the press release says that ramsey is quote discerning palette is behind the seltzers for unapologetically bold flavors
POD1000000041_S0000459	they are all inspired by the popular menu items from his hell is kitchen restaurant i am like so what beef wellington yeah that is gross lobster risotto
POD1000000041_S0000460	i worked on the hell is kitchen show so i know what else we are talking about is it the i mean beef wellington seltzer sounds like it is worth a punt
POD1000000041_S0000462	and i hear the ingredients by the way are seltzer natural flavors and hate
POD1000000041_S0000464	his cheesy ass promo talk is amazing too this is gordon ramsay

POD1000000042_S0000023	what exactly is your expectation
POD1000000042_S0000024	celebration
POD1000000042_S0000025	success means that you do not have responsibilities anymore
POD1000000042_S0000026	yes for one day one day
POD1000000042_S0000027	jaco would not like that
POD1000000042_S0000028	one day you are supposed to celebrate for one day i believe i do not know
POD1000000042_S0000029	when you finish your book you have got a new book out it is called the talent war when you finish your new book what was the celebration because these things are so goddamn hard to write
POD1000000042_S0000030	i can not express it enough where people are like i want to write a book and i am always like do not do not do it it is so hard man
POD1000000042_S0000031	it was the 1st time i put the crayons down and picked up a actual pen yeah but i would rather go back to war another 10 times
POD1000000042_S0000033	it is crazy right
POD1000000042_S0000034	insane
POD1000000042_S0000035	tell everybody the process and what made you want to write this book it is called the talent war
POD1000000042_S0000036	yeah you got a co author here george randall and and josh cotton as well and you put the phd on the end
POD1000000042_S0000037	we of course you have to have the doctorate just to make it seem official so no we you know george was a army veteran mustang back in the 80s 90s he has been in talent acquisition for 20 years
POD1000000042_S0000038	i came out of the seal teams and i started a foundation to help veterans get jobs that totally failed
POD1000000042_S0000039	and then we sort of pivoted jocko willink myself and lafe took that idea and made it a for profit and so i placed vets high performing vets into senior leadership positions and as we are doing this dude companies are just bad at hiring
POD1000000042_S0000040	
POD1000000042_S0000041	they just do not know how to do it and so that blueprint that book just takes how special operations forces have over the past half a century evolved probably the longest behavioral interview and how to implement that into your company
POD1000000042_S0000042	and start building teams that
POD1000000042_S0000043	right right but google is not going to be able to put you in the wake doing flutter kicks all day right
POD1000000042_S0000044	so then you got to find other ways to test people is metal i suppose and i am curious i have not read the book yet is there anything in there about that like non kinetic ways to test
POD1000000042_S0000046	so there are we do not get into the means as much as the strategy of having a talent mindset but yeah do not take your candidates down to the surf zone you will end up in a pretty litigious
POD1000000042_S0000047	situation
POD1000000042_S0000048	not a good idea
POD1000000042_S0000049	it is applying the pressure in the interview process and having a multivariate process from assessments and there is a lot of things people just do not know how to interview as well right you watch george randall
POD1000000042_S0000050	he will apply the pressure so companies sometimes will call us not to hire some of our people but to run interview processes for them and give us our opinion
POD1000000042_S0000051	and he will bring the pain on them you are talking 30 year execs who just
POD1000000042_S0000053	right
POD1000000042_S0000054	some of them do the good ones do but even role play i mean you put in jocko is big role play guy
POD1000000042_S0000056	he just found something out about jocko here folks
POD1000000042_S0000057	loves roleplay
POD1000000042_S0000059	cut it right there
POD1000000042_S0000061	we started this show just to catch people off guard cut half of what they say out leave the rest out and make it a fucking headline
POD1000000042_S0000062	yeah dude so now your book will be chopped up when this comes out it will say
POD1000000042_S0000064	author wrote a book about jocko is roleplay
POD1000000042_S0000065	yeah we did it to tim kennedy we were like this guy can not stop talking about hitler hitler hitler hitler he is obsessed with hitler i mean this show was called finding hitler but i mean .
POD1000000042_S0000066	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000067	whatever
POD1000000042_S0000068	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000069	that is not our problem
POD1000000042_S0000070	not our problem
POD1000000042_S0000071	hey i was duly warned about coming to this show now i understand it jaco i love you do not fire me
POD1000000042_S0000073	yeah so get ready to move
POD1000000042_S0000074	and real quick speaking of jocko in all sincerity here he wrote the foreword to your book and before we came on air you work with jocko how did that come about
POD1000000042_S0000075	so i was in his task unit as a young seal officer i came from the marine corps i was a recon marine on the enlisted side and bro you talk about good leaders he is as good as they come
POD1000000042_S0000076	because everyone talks a big game what do we say in texas
POD1000000042_S0000078	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000079	he practices what he preaches
POD1000000042_S0000080	then i went on to deploy another 9 times but people have already read the book and they are like that is the best written part of the book
POD1000000042_S0000082	yeah now they are like it is pretty much jacko in this one
POD1000000042_S0000083	somebody asked me the other day they are like well how do you think this book fares against extreme ownership and i am like that is like asking how does your son who plays basketball in high school fare against lebron
POD1000000042_S0000084	right right
POD1000000042_S0000085	i did not know how to respond
POD1000000042_S0000087	it is different here is the thing man anybody in today is society can be famous overnight
POD1000000042_S0000088	if they get the right avenue right like david goggins is a perfect example going on rogan man i did not know who that was
POD1000000042_S0000089	until he went on joe rogan jaco i was not familiar with because i am a non military guy right i am a civilian but he goes on rogan and crushes and you are like all right great it depends on the opportunities and where you are
POD1000000042_S0000090	and then your messaging after it on top of it now clearly what you are writing about is extremely important for today is world and helping getting jobs when you come out
POD1000000042_S0000091	and maybe this show will be the platform for you for you as a person why was this so important to write
POD1000000042_S0000093	you know fundamentally the strongest force in this nation is our economy and people do not take that seriously you know it is our duty as american citizens to make sure that thing is as strong as possible because when it is we have everything we need in the military
POD1000000042_S0000094	and for a vet coming out if you can not find purpose you know so many vets nowadays say hey you know i do not know my why i do not know my purpose yeah you have got one purpose get a job make the economy stronger
POD1000000042_S0000095	and that is your duty to the next generation of military leaders coming in
POD1000000042_S0000097	and why do you think it is so hard to get through people is heads of why they should hire military veterans this is one that i will never understand
POD1000000042_S0000098	in a 10 years
POD1000000042_S0000100	you know that someone is resume is far less important than their ability to fucking change on the fly right to absorb information make quick decisions and then turn that information into good decisions
POD1000000042_S0000101	you know what i mean you can teach people to do it it is not true that you can not teach people but people that can do it under extreme duress are few and far between and those are the people you want in those high level positions
POD1000000042_S0000102	yes or in even lower level positions i do not understand that as well i got my 1st taste of it on range 15 when i directed that that was the 1st time where most of the people behind the camera were veterans
POD1000000042_S0000103	they did not have as much experience as typical people in hollywood but the work ethic they outworked any of those lazy assholes like 3 to one and after that i mean my mind completely changed where i was just like dude
POD1000000042_S0000104	if you are not hiring military veterans to do all the shit you are missing out on . because it is something you do not have to teach them you do not have to teach them worth ethic whatsoever or what it is like to get up early and work hard and all that stuff
POD1000000042_S0000105	that is already instilled in everybody that comes out of the military as a civilian my god man that is the 1st fucking people i would hire over any of these fucking assholes it was like eh
POD1000000042_S0000106	my dad did this or i got in this or whatever and it is like well great how is that going to help my company
POD1000000042_S0000107	so the book is not exactly an argument for why you should hire veterans but as a whole it speaks to you hire for character you hire for attitude you hire for mindset
POD1000000042_S0000108	industry experience which is how 99% of companies hire is not a predictor of success it is not just because somebody has 5 years of marketing experience does not mean they are good at marketing
POD1000000042_S0000109	if you find somebody with all the right attributes and you train them like you just said they will outwork they will outpace those people eventually and it is frustrating you know the systemic challenges with veterans you know where civilians get this
POD1000000042_S0000110	because let us be honest you know coming out of world war 2 pretty much everyone served in the military for the most part yeah and they had they understood
POD1000000042_S0000111	i had to yeah
POD1000000042_S0000112	yeah they understood the value of veterans it is now the one versus the 99%
POD1000000042_S0000113	well i mean it is it is .4 or 5% actually to be specific yes i think in i think in world war 2 was like 15.8% to the now .4 or 5% yeah
POD1000000042_S0000115	right
POD1000000042_S0000116	so it is a different world now obviously
POD1000000042_S0000117	so the 99.5% their perceptions are based off what they see in the movies hollywood is always going to be the best recruiting tool for the military it is also its worst enemy when you get out
POD1000000042_S0000118	that is why shows like seal team are so important like they get it all right they do not church up any of the bullshit and it is one thing to be to challenge some of those issues and take them on in a network environment is tough when you are murdering people basically
POD1000000042_S0000119	but they get a lot right and all those guys are huge supporters of the military as well that is why they got into the program in the 1st place tyler is a you know tyler
POD1000000042_S0000120	telegrahe
POD1000000042_S0000121	he is a he is a fucking man yes he is he is a magnet for good and talented people i do not know what it is about him that makes that happen maybe he is jesus it is hard to say
POD1000000042_S0000123	it seems like people 1st of all he is one of the hardest working human beings i have ever met in my life but he is also brilliant and an operator
POD1000000042_S0000124	people flock to him to be able to express shit like that and i talk to people i have been on set a couple times i have talked to the people that work on that show that have been in hollywood for years and they do not talk about vets the same way that other people out there do
POD1000000042_S0000125	there is something different about the way they speak and you can tell that it is just experience right
POD1000000042_S0000126	that is all it is it is experience one on one with a human being it is the reason nobody hates gay people anymore everybody was afraid of gay people 15 years ago and they are like 0 everybody is gay cool now no one cares anymore and i think there is some reticence
POD1000000042_S0000127	on behalf of the general public to deal with veterans just to deal with them in general and we are also really bad at asking for help when we need it too
POD1000000042_S0000128	so all these things come together and the result unfortunately very often is some dude alone in his apartment with a fucking gun in his hand you know what i mean that is a too common standard here and it is what it is i mean we have to educate
POD1000000042_S0000129	at the end of the day and that is what this book does
POD1000000042_S0000130	we were lucky to have served in a tribe really some of the last tribes that exist in the us and when you leave an environment where all you knew was team and esprit de corps
POD1000000042_S0000131	it is hard to come back especially when you see the leadership in the national capital region where we expect our leadership to be the best and we get the exact opposite and they can not even work with it you know together with some civility
POD1000000042_S0000132	and you come back from a military environment and you are like what the hell is going on
POD1000000042_S0000133	we are very disappointed we have got the best military that you could possibly have we have the best idea the best fundamental idea that any country is based on
POD1000000042_S0000134	and i think it is 2 parts one is individual liberty and the other part is what mlk said you have 2 hands for a reason one to pull yourself up and one to pull the next guy up with you
POD1000000042_S0000135	those are the 2 fundamental guiding principles of most americans lives i hope but somehow we end up every single year with the shittiest possible leaders like what does it say about american culture that we are not able to put people in
POD1000000042_S0000137	i think maybe the presumption that everybody is on the same page is a dangerous presumption because clearly there is a lot of fucking snakes out there and we have put that part of our brain on hold because our lives are busy
POD1000000042_S0000138	but it might be time to start paying a little bit of attention to what is going on in politics again not just fucking re sharing stupid shit on facebook but actually pay attention to who is saying what how full of shit both of these parties are
POD1000000042_S0000139	and how they are basically just fucking using you to get what they want i think it is really important for people to fucking turn inward and start looking at themselves and how they have allowed this shit to happen because we have to prevent it from continuing we have to stop it in its tracks
POD1000000042_S0000140	we have to prevent it from happening again as well like we are not learning a lot of lessons right now everybody is just
POD1000000042_S0000142	it is fucking stupid
POD1000000042_S0000143	if you do not take an interest in politics politics will assuredly take an interest in you and i think a lot of people are now seeing that and the amount of people that do not get out to vote is i do not know if i want to say disgusting
POD1000000042_S0000144	but that is your civic duty to get out there and vote i think people are going to wake up and they are going to start getting a lot more involved
POD1000000042_S0000145	quite frankly veterans
POD1000000042_S0000146	
POD1000000042_S0000147	we need more veterans like dan crenshaw
POD1000000042_S0000148	right
POD1000000042_S0000149	in there with you know dan has shown the ability to reach across the aisle and have a civil conversation yeah that guy is definitely the candidate for 2024 i do not doubt that one bit
POD1000000042_S0000150	maybe you are probably right as well
POD1000000042_S0000151	as long as his own party in their fucking deep butthurt state that they are in right now we do not even know if this is over yet by the way but in their deep butthurt state
POD1000000042_S0000152	they are going to lash out at anybody that gives anything towards the middle and that is the fucking dumbest shit of all time if you want to make yourself truly irrelevant become the tea party start to shout
POD1000000042_S0000153	thou shalt not infringe over and over until your ears bleed and everybody is like all right well we do not have to listen to that idiot anymore
POD1000000042_S0000154	right
POD1000000042_S0000155	if you think you can go play this game whatever this game is without negotiating and taking other people is it is not about giving up ground it is about taking other people is lives and circumstances into fucking mind
POD1000000042_S0000156	when you are making decisions that is a good that is a trait of a good human being to do that by the way it does not it does not make you weak to consider the feelings and plight of other people
POD1000000042_S0000157	how could that possibly be true because the strongest people we know take that thing into consideration and go fight and die for it it does not make any goddamn sense
POD1000000042_S0000158	but somehow we have applied that politically where it is somehow perceived as a weakness or disloyal to agree with a fact like no dude this is information
POD1000000042_S0000160	you are just get out of here with that stuff but we can not do it and i do not know why i do not know why
POD1000000042_S0000161	i do not either and speaking of politics did you feel like you had a political hangover today when you got up and started the day because now look it is monday we are recording this on monday
POD1000000042_S0000162	you wake up you walk the streets you get to talk to people or see people is expressions what is your feeling today
POD1000000042_S0000163	so my wife and i were downtown on saturday shortly after they made the announcement and people were driving around honking and great i understand that they are happy for their side
POD1000000042_S0000164	but the biggest realization for me and one i feel like something is coming
POD1000000042_S0000165	the republicans are like laying in wait but they have got some there is just this eerie feeling but my whole takeaway from this is one people need to be just so less polarized
POD1000000042_S0000166	and so less emotional and i know that is mainly the left but federal government has become way too freaking big
POD1000000042_S0000167	and that is what needs to change and it needs to be pushed down to the state and local level as it was always intended and it will put less emphasis on federal government if we end up doing that
POD1000000042_S0000168	0 you mean like the 10th amendment says to you
POD1000000042_S0000169	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000170	i mean it was one of the bill of goddamn rights maybe we should take it seriously or we just do whatever who cares
POD1000000042_S0000171	if the libertarian party was not so messed up
POD1000000042_S0000172	i mean the ideas have not been fleshed out they are too they are too young their economic policies are nonsense and because of that nobody is going to take them seriously you have to have something that is applicable applicable
POD1000000042_S0000173	and scalable not just a good idea it is we are in 2020 now you can not just say like you know what would be great is if this like yeah it would be great but that is not fucking reality
POD1000000042_S0000174	you also need a popular candidate
POD1000000042_S0000175	well yeah i mean .
POD1000000042_S0000176	that will go out there and and you have got to somebody has got to turn the tide because right now
POD1000000042_S0000177	was their pr person because i did not see joe jorgensen on any news station ever like i know she made appearances here and there but you need
POD1000000042_S0000178	even here man
POD1000000042_S0000179	if you are trying to start a new party you have to have like a good 30 40 people all saying the same exact shit all at the same time and being able to defend those points as well like we believe this because of this challenge me on that maybe i can i can flex on it a little bit
POD1000000042_S0000180	but here is why we believe what we believe what do you guys believe 0 well here is why what you are thinking right now is not is right technically but in application it will not work right
POD1000000042_S0000181	and here is the last 40 years of proof of that now let us try something different but no it is not that it is just like they will show not infringing
POD1000000042_S0000182	yeah yeah yeah
POD1000000042_S0000183	fucking fuck the 2 party system i mean that does not really tell me anything i need information with which to make a decision you know what i mean
POD1000000042_S0000184	right but you are not going to get it even with jo jorgensen we had her vp candidate on the show spike
POD1000000042_S0000186	and the promise initially was hey man joe jorgensen is going to come on next week or whatever she did not end up coming on the show
POD1000000042_S0000187	probably because i lit him up a little bit for seeing dumb shit
POD1000000042_S0000188	either way man you do not turn down 1030 listeners right you try to get your message out there despite whatever it is because it is hard to go out to an audience of this size anywhere right now
POD1000000042_S0000189	you would not get it on jimmy fallon if you are going on jimmy fallon so no matter if people are going to challenge you or not you still want to get your message out to the listeners and i also think again you need a candidate in that party who is popular enough to say all right
POD1000000042_S0000190	we are going to start voting for this we are going to start taking this party seriously regardless of it takes votes away from one of the other because i think that is always been one of the biggest arguments right is somebody has been afraid to run down the middle with the
POD1000000042_S0000192	that is going to take votes from this other candidate you have to stop being afraid of that yes you are going to take votes from another candidate but in order to establish a serious 3rd party
POD1000000042_S0000193	someone has got to start it and it has got to be serious and there has got to be some financial backing because they did not have that much money there
POD1000000042_S0000194	no ross produs paid for himself
POD1000000042_S0000195	yes
POD1000000042_S0000196	and that is why i said i have been criticized for this before but i think bloomberg should have run as an independent i think that bernie sanders should have run as an independent i think mitt romney should probably have run as an independent because he represents a different wing of the republican party
POD1000000042_S0000197	
POD1000000042_S0000198	look this is not about a versus b this is about what the fuck is best for my goddamn country right what is all this that is happening right now that made this worth all the fucking blood that has been shed to make this happen
POD1000000042_S0000199	look we had this idea that individual liberty is really important and we think we can govern our entire lives around it and we sent men to battle for it for years over and over
POD1000000042_S0000200	one major war every 20 years in the history of this country to support that fucking idea show me where the fucking value is in that now like show me what fucking reverence is being given back to that fucking promise
POD1000000042_S0000201	in that sacrifice just so you can spit in a cop is face and complain about fascism in a country that has never seen fascism let us be real you know what i mean
POD1000000042_S0000203	i do not know that anything in american politics can be fixed with voting at this point honestly i do not think it can until people change the way they think about what is right and what is wrong
POD1000000042_S0000204	right is not correct and left is not correct correct is correct bitch
POD1000000042_S0000205	right
POD1000000042_S0000206	the idea that you would say well that is a republican talking point anything that is a talking point to me is bullshit i do not want to hear that prove it then i will believe it this is not god it was 2020
POD1000000042_S0000208	i have all the information in the world on this little device right here and somehow we can not figure out how to agree on fucking reality
POD1000000042_S0000209	and it is not coming anytime soon
POD1000000042_S0000210	is it because we do not have those old tribal lines anymore because of globalism like we do not i can not just like dislike the other country and take care of mine because i have to like everybody now is that it is that really what it is i mean are we that fucking pathetic
POD1000000042_S0000211	to your point about all the bloodshed it is an afterthought in people is minds if it is even there at all there is a sense of entitlement in america
POD1000000042_S0000212	that americans are almost entitled for soldiers going forward overseas and giving their lives and they are going to tune into the kardashians or whatever tv show is popular
POD1000000042_S0000213	so this will be the 1st of many years on november 11th i usually go to ottawa to celebrate with some canadian
POD1000000042_S0000215	we have 2 guys that are the version of special operations
POD1000000042_S0000216	
POD1000000042_S0000217	and i have never seen a country like
POD1000000042_S0000219	let us say the united kingdom celebrate a holiday like that americans do not celebrate veterans day anywhere close to what canada and britain do everyone stops
POD1000000042_S0000220	every town has a memorial everyone is wearing a red poppy you have never seen such unity and that is why it is sad to say that i served 20 years and every 11th of november i do my best to make it to canada
POD1000000042_S0000221	really
POD1000000042_S0000222	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000223	no shit
POD1000000042_S0000224	yes
POD1000000042_S0000226	this will be the 1st year because one the covid restrictions and 2 the launch of the book
POD1000000042_S0000227	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000228	but yeah
POD1000000042_S0000229	that is crazy that is crazy yeah me personally as far as political hangover goes today i typically watch the there is a today show or something on in the morning as i am getting ready
POD1000000042_S0000230	for work just to kind of catch up on the news this was the 1st day that it was not dominated by madness over trump and anger over trump and everything else
POD1000000042_S0000231	they almost did not know what to talk about on the news you know there was a couple things of like hey there was a celebration of biden and harrison
POD1000000042_S0000233	they seem lost when they could not talk about anything regarding trump
POD1000000042_S0000234	and we already know what they are going to talk about for the next 4 years right
POD1000000042_S0000235	like that is i was trying to guess that earlier on
POD1000000042_S0000237	revolution what is it what are they going to talk about
POD1000000042_S0000238	but provided things stay as they are with these counts what they are going to talk about is how the republicans are trying to prosecute biden for the russia bullshit which is hilarious by the way
POD1000000042_S0000240	something different
POD1000000042_S0000241	for no for that but his involvement in it which we know he had some of it do not do not be naive let us let us just be adults here
POD1000000042_S0000242	yeah the big guy
POD1000000042_S0000243	we will see about that we will see it probably is i mean it definitely passes the smell test and we know that those emails are legit now not necessarily we do not know that biden is the big guy necessarily we know those emails are legit
POD1000000042_S0000244	anyways we will hear about that because the republicans are going to try to do that they are also going to probably win the house in the midterm the republicans probably will
POD1000000042_S0000245	in 2022
POD1000000042_S0000246	because things are too tumultuous right now for biden to maintain a positive feel there is going to be a lot of war going on with the democratic
POD1000000042_S0000248	at everybody right now
POD1000000042_S0000249	antifa just burned down the goddamn portland dnc headquarters and wrote a bunch of profane shit with biden is name on it
POD1000000042_S0000250	why he was not progressive enough
POD1000000042_S0000251	they let the inmates run the asylum the democratic party will fracture
POD1000000042_S0000252	yeah it is going to fracture so they are going to be in 2022 the republicans will win back the house and it is fucking bulls on parade at that point right they are going to be lighting him up with on everything they can
POD1000000042_S0000253	for the next 2 years and then cnn and msnbc will be defending biden the same way that fox has been defending trump except for when they have not right
POD1000000042_S0000254	it is it is nonsense yeah this is all i this is like a play it is like it is it is
POD1000000042_S0000256	yeah yeah yeah yeah
POD1000000042_S0000257	from what is it called
POD1000000042_S0000258	price is right they now sell it for a home version by the way if you are curious they do
POD1000000042_S0000260	no question which line it is going to go down it may vary a little bit but it is going to go down in one general area you know it every single time we are fucking dummies we are in the best country that could possibly exist right
POD1000000042_S0000261	right
POD1000000042_S0000262	because of our geographical standoff because the idea that we built the country on individual liberty we have the best opportunity in this country to stave off any kind of attack
POD1000000042_S0000263	while also flourishing as much as a culture can but you know what we do nothing we are idiots we start to see some success you know like i deserve this like if you achieve something
POD1000000042_S0000265	there is a reason why all these dum dums when they win awards get up on stage and be like i would just like to thank everybody involved in this not because they really believe it because they probably do not let us be real but that is exactly how your brain should work your brain should once you accomplish something
POD1000000042_S0000266	even the smallest thing during the day like 0 fuck it that was great start thinking about what allowed you the opportunity to do that stuff not because you did not work hard it is not because of that it is because everybody is fucking working hard it does not make you special to work hard okay
POD1000000042_S0000267	that makes you doing the bare minimum frankly so yeah i did this great thing at work today you know what was really great is when i did not have to worry about shit at home because my wife had already taken care of it or whatever the case is right
POD1000000042_S0000268	that is a big fucking mental leap to make as a human being and if you can start to implement shit like that in your real life i think you would be a lot goddamn happier
POD1000000042_S0000269	like i work on that it is easy to talk about it is very difficult to do that shit in real time because you are so much in your own head that you do not think about it at the time and then 10 minutes later you are like fuck i should have said this
POD1000000042_S0000270	i am lucky because i think for me personally at least in my relationship and my home life i enjoy my wife and i enjoy my children a lot
POD1000000042_S0000271	so when i go home i do not have an issue of like holy shit i have got a fire on the news or get angry about anything i do not because i actually love my family and it is real i know a lot of people who do not
POD1000000042_S0000272	i am not one of them fortunately so i do not have those issues and problems but everybody else who is i think they use politics and everything else as a crutch of like well this is why my life sucks and everything else
POD1000000042_S0000273	it is not hard to take a couple minutes out of your day and think about what you should be grateful for and then maybe if it is people go show some gratitude it does not take a whole lot of time to do either one of those things it is something that i am a dude that lives in my own head quite a bit i am heady
POD1000000042_S0000274	which is an annoying thing to say but it is true i fucking sit around in the stair shit and think for 45 minutes and people think i am nuts right or i walk around like people are not standing around me sometimes even if it is at my own home
POD1000000042_S0000275	
POD1000000042_S0000276	and that is off putting to people like you can not just act like that now so i know i am heady and shit i think about this stuff a lot but it does trap me up like i get caught in that moment
POD1000000042_S0000277	where i am just like let me think about everything that is going on right now like no you should i got to you got to train yourself right 21 days it takes to train something into your daily routine that will last forever
POD1000000042_S0000278	21 days typically speaking for a normal person so it is not that hard to do it is just a matter of effort right and strategy i think we are all failing at it like pretty much everybody i know fails at this shit
POD1000000042_S0000279	like how do we enjoy what is happening in real time instead of being nostalgic later because this is the only time we have got this resource of time is the only one that we can not replace
POD1000000042_S0000280	and i will say this that is the only thing that i have figured out in this life and i figured it out at a very very early age that time was the most valuable thing that we have
POD1000000042_S0000281	so i consider myself good at that but bad at other things i do not know about you
POD1000000042_S0000283	i am not going to give bandwidth to things i can not change or affect i am just over it and at the end of the day you know jaco said this he is like you know people get so worked up that trump is going to elected well he maybe moves the azimuth like 2 degrees to the right
POD1000000042_S0000284	biden gets elected yeah maybe 4 degrees to the left but we are still moving in the same general direction
POD1000000042_S0000285	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000286	it is like you have got friends because i went to ut that when they lose a game it is like their whole week is destroyed
POD1000000042_S0000287	well they have had a rough couple of weeks
POD1000000042_S0000288	they have had a rough 15 years
POD1000000042_S0000289	shrug your shoulders you are not in the field you are an alumni just move on with your day
POD1000000042_S0000290	that is one thing i am bad about i will admit that you are terrible dude i went to ohio state so i am fucking terrible
POD1000000042_S0000291	what do you guys usually dominate
POD1000000042_S0000292	i know
POD1000000042_S0000293	yeah but when we do not dominate
POD1000000042_S0000294	that will eat away at me forever and that is something i am terrible at and i will fully admit that
POD1000000042_S0000295	i wonder what are we getting out of that exactly like i am a fan of various sports teams what do i personally get out of them winning
POD1000000042_S0000296	so me personally
POD1000000042_S0000297	that by the way because what do i lose when they lose
POD1000000042_S0000298	right and is it commensurate right because i do not actually lose anything
POD1000000042_S0000299	well you maybe he was a person yeah
POD1000000042_S0000300	maybe i gained some endorphin you know being being shot out of my brain
POD1000000042_S0000301	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000302	for some period of time and maybe that makes me happier but there is probably other ways to accomplish that that i do not get so emotionally invested in and shit i can not control i guess maybe it is to your point right like there is stuff that i can do to have that endorphin release for example cocaine
POD1000000042_S0000304	i know you were waiting for me to stop so you could say cocaine and it is the reason you were going to say it is because it is fucking true
POD1000000042_S0000306	cocaine and mdma and you can have that cm endorphin release without giving a shit what happens on saturdays as a matter of fact you probably will not be awake for the game
POD1000000042_S0000308	you will have been out all friday night
POD1000000042_S0000309	be too too late for the game
POD1000000042_S0000310	i mean if you stayed up all night the night prior was my my joke there
POD1000000042_S0000311	so here is like i do not do cocaine therefore i have to live on sports or something so
POD1000000042_S0000312	but it is a drug right i mean like to his point the reason i went on that whole fucking soliloquy there is because to his point we give so much power over our daily mood to shit that we literally can not control how stupid is that
POD1000000042_S0000313	that is like handing a fucking loaded gun to a crazy person just like alright we will see what happens you know what i mean because you literally have no control over whether or not ohio state wins
POD1000000042_S0000314	you also have no control over the vast majority of the shit that happens to you in life what do you have control over though it is the real question and i am not asking rhetorically i want to know what you think about that
POD1000000042_S0000315	time to me it is time i do not know what it is to you but time my wife always says i am impatient and then i will try to 0 i got to get through this line or i got to get through this or whatever it is because my time is so valuable
POD1000000042_S0000316	and i realized that is the one thing you just cannot get back that is why i am impatient it is not the other stuff of i just do not want to wait in line or i just do not want to do this i just value my time that much i do not know what yours is
POD1000000042_S0000317	i think that is why i am so respectful of people is time and i will not ask for a lot of help because i do not want to take up their time my time is very important to me and sometimes i can be a little brutal about it same same
POD1000000042_S0000318	do not do not waste my time because i am not going to waste yours but let me put it in the context and you know leaving after 20 years between you know
POD1000000042_S0000320	lost a lot of brothers
POD1000000042_S0000321	and i just dominated my life for like 3 years during the transition
POD1000000042_S0000322	thinking about them
POD1000000042_S0000323	thinking about them thinking about everything thinking about how the war was fought and how i just totally disagree with the evolution of that war i mean it was a mystery for you
POD1000000042_S0000324	it was vietnam 2 man come on
POD1000000042_S0000325	in the fact that there are still young 18 year olds in afghanistan
POD1000000042_S0000326	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000327	like just it gets me but there was a point to where and this is why like at least the military guys i am around i have got a strong core of like seals there is like 4 of us we are boys we just do not talk about the military stuff anymore
POD1000000042_S0000328	we do not want it to eat any more of our bandwidth we all gave 20 for it we are done we are pushing it behind and our job is to live now for the guys that did not come come home live in their absence in live in their memory memory
POD1000000042_S0000329	but that is sort of when you are asking to contextualize it that is immediately what jumps into my mind
POD1000000042_S0000330	let me ask you guys this question because you both seem to be around the same age and you both served and you were both overseas looking back at it now right all these years later
POD1000000042_S0000332	would you have gone back if you could have you know talked to yourself at that age when you entered knowing what you know now would you have done it both of you
POD1000000042_S0000333	yes
POD1000000042_S0000334	same with you yeah
POD1000000042_S0000335	but because the guys were going to go yeah the guys were going to go i was going to be there with him and quite frankly you join i am sure it was the same for you you join because you love your country
POD1000000042_S0000336	right
POD1000000042_S0000337	and the only thing necessary for evil is for good men to stand by and do nothing we all know that quote but it becomes less about the united states because you get older
POD1000000042_S0000338	you see that i hate to say it that the civilian populace is not as grateful as they should be
POD1000000042_S0000339	sure
POD1000000042_S0000340	and i do not need that pat on the back i do not but for my guys i wanted them to be respected and the remainder of your deployments come about it is just about the guys and the team
POD1000000042_S0000341	so the anger then is your anger once you got out and you think about you said vietnam 2 is it towards the government then of like hey guys why the fuck did you have this figured out before you sent us over there
POD1000000042_S0000342	i would say more so than anybody that was a member of the government at that time the generals and i said this a couple of weeks ago too
POD1000000042_S0000343	these motherfuckers knew man they knew they were fucking vietnam survivors if you want to call it that all these general officers that were around they knew this is bullshit they knew the thing with iraq at least was bullshit with afghanistan that is a strategical move i thought was inappropriate but it is what it is
POD1000000042_S0000344	that is just mission creep that shit happens but with iraq that was all nonsense that was dick cheney that is all that was dick cheney is trying to get rich that is all it is or he had some fucking thing against saddam hussein
POD1000000042_S0000345	or whatever the fuck right i mean he it is funny how cheney and that other turd that was the sec def under bush what is his name i can see his stupid face in my head he was a congressman before anyways right
POD1000000042_S0000347	rumsfeld donald rumsfeld yeah
POD1000000042_S0000348	yeah he those guys you can see them shaking hands with with saddam back in the day you know when we were selling them weapons and shit all of a sudden now they are against him but
POD1000000042_S0000349	of what changed between the mid 80s and the early 2000s with iraq exactly what changed nothing is the answer so yeah i mean there is anger to be spread around but i think the generals bear the the biggest part of that burden
POD1000000042_S0000350	because they had the authority i mean look it is different in 2020 than it was in 2000 right so generals back then would not have jumped on twitter and be like hey this guy is an asshole we should not be deploying or whatever the fuck
POD1000000042_S0000351	maybe that is a good thing that they did not do that but they were the most authoritative people on something that they knew would become mission creep like we are just going to go in and stabilize and like anytime anybody during a military operation says
POD1000000042_S0000352	we are just going to dot dot dot go ahead and fucking set your shit on fire because you are not coming back you know what i mean it is it is the dumbest shit of all time
POD1000000042_S0000354	but i am not i would not say i am really angry just it is more disappointment than anger like you can not be angry for that long
POD1000000042_S0000355	that is good because look obviously we have a bunch of friends who are in the military between us and there is some people who are just pissed just angry of like man i did not i thought i was doing something that i was lied about
POD1000000042_S0000356	i mean i think that anger is often an effigy for all like that that when you hear veterans bitching about shit it is usually a redirection it is an effigy of what is really going wrong with them and here there is a number of different things going wrong with them one
POD1000000042_S0000357	they have lost their support system which is difficult like you were saying 2 is that any kind of threat at all seems to me like something i need to be on my toes for and it is like a dog right like if you and jesse had a dog and you were walking it
POD1000000042_S0000358	the dog is going to be pretty calm if jesse walks that dog and anybody comes near that dog is immediately going to get protective and for us the 1st thing that happens to me when i feel danger is i get fucking pissed off like i get as angry as i have ever been in my life for a very brief period of time
POD1000000042_S0000359	and then i get tunnel vision i start looking for shit to do you know what i mean i think that is a common thing for people that have been
POD1000000042_S0000360	trained to do that all the time it is difficult to turn that off i do not know if you ever really turn it off completely because even when you get back here like we realize as pragmatists as people who have walked through extremely dangerous situations
POD1000000042_S0000361	and gotten so comfortable with that that oftentimes we ignored some of those dangerous situations moving back here and doing all this stuff a lot of stuff like piques my interest that will never pique yours like the way somebody is holding their hands there is all kinds of fucking examples of it
POD1000000042_S0000362	but it becomes problematic in your life you can not keep doing that so you got to find a different outlet for it you have to fucking find some kind of purpose and i am working on that now still after 10 years of this shit
POD1000000042_S0000363	find some kind of purpose that instead of my heightened level of awareness coming off as angry like i am doing something positive with that shit
POD1000000042_S0000364	right
POD1000000042_S0000365	because otherwise it will fucking eat you alive always so i do not want to be fucking mad all the time i do not want any of that bullshit
POD1000000042_S0000366	yeah and mike you are doing something positive as well with this book i know you are a busy man and you are on a tour right now tell everybody where they can find your book
POD1000000042_S0000367	and where they can grab it i know covid is different now because you used to be able to like go to barnes and noble or things like that it almost feels safer to just say hey man just go to amazon
POD1000000042_S0000368	and if you want to give us a really quick synopsis of what it is exactly
POD1000000042_S0000369	yes
POD1000000042_S0000370	yeah it is it is about a talent mindset which is the strongest tool you can have to dominate whatever the hell you do it is recognizing that your people are the most strategic competitive advantage
POD1000000042_S0000371	you will ever achieve and can maintain human capital exactly it is not your systems it is not your technology it is always been and always will be people and the military has always understood that
POD1000000042_S0000372	and it does not matter if you have 7 people that go up against 100 if you have 7 people that are better than those 100 they will wipe them out
POD1000000042_S0000373	awesome awesome well you can check out the talent war it is out now amazon right
POD1000000042_S0000374	amazon anywhere books are sold is there an audiobook for that yet there is and again the best part of it is the introduction by jocko
POD1000000042_S0000375	did he do his own intro he did and then i tried to do a mix between leif babin and jocko and it just did not come off as genuine
POD1000000042_S0000376	did you do it i did good you have to
POD1000000042_S0000377	hey that was the hardest thing i have ever done i went home at 4 p m and i looked at my wife and i said just let me go to sleep
POD1000000042_S0000378	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000379	using different bandwidths i was spent
POD1000000042_S0000380	it is crazy
POD1000000042_S0000381	his last audiobook what was that in fucking
POD1000000042_S0000382	july
POD1000000042_S0000384	brutal man and it is how long how many days is yours
POD1000000042_S0000385	and then my co author was another 2
POD1000000042_S0000386	it is usually about 4 days and you are cramming in like 50 pages a day what people do not understand is that every time you mispronounce something you have to stop and go back
POD1000000042_S0000387	and it is like the word the or something here and there
POD1000000042_S0000388	but if it is a fluid sentence you have to read the entire sentence if it is a fluid paragraph you have to read the whole goddamn paragraph again so that experience alone well i think would prevent me from ever writing a 2nd
POD1000000042_S0000390	no right we are just like dude i got to read the fucking .
POD1000000042_S0000391	just got to hire the british guy next time and he will

POD1000000042_S0000393	no do not which is like all the novels my wife listens to
POD1000000042_S0000394	yeah but i will say this because when you are writing a book it should come from you therefore every author who is out there who is thinking about writing a book
POD1000000042_S0000395	read it yourself people want to hear from you
POD1000000042_S0000396	unless you are kamala harris nobody wants to hear her voice no like i have seen more memes from lefty people about the way she speaks they fucking hate her holy shit dude
POD1000000042_S0000397	it is an unlikable candidate
POD1000000042_S0000398	but they hate her a little less than they hated trump i guess
POD1000000042_S0000399	right yeah a little bit which is weird
POD1000000042_S0000400	little bit we will see
POD1000000042_S0000401	yeah i mean we will see
POD1000000042_S0000402	we will see how it picks up speaking of which we are going to talk about that after we get to the sponsors and i believe d got to meyer is going to join us here with that mike we greatly appreciate you being on the show

POD1000000042_S0000408	the pillows are just as great as the goddamn mattress i think $140 savings too i will say this hate to tip my hand here
POD1000000042_S0000409	but they are going to have a monster black friday sale it is going to be how monstrous is the size of that guy is dick that you always get texted it is going to be that big huge black friday sale so get ready for that

POD1000000042_S0000411	and all of the deals i just mentioned are applicable with that so that means you are getting that shit for like $38
POD1000000042_S0000413	slash drinking bros that wine club
POD1000000042_S0000415	yeah like wine
POD1000000042_S0000416	yeah big fan
POD1000000042_S0000417	pretty much it
POD1000000042_S0000418	pretty much look there is 2 things that you like in this life it is you like drugs and you like wine
POD1000000042_S0000419	well i like more than that i like steaks as well but .
POD1000000042_S0000420	what about me
POD1000000042_S0000421	no not
POD1000000042_S0000423	i do definitely like wine i it is it is it is i had the benefit i guess if you want to if these days you definitely can not call it that but if you could ever call the call living in the bay area the benefit of in any way it was because i could go to wine country whenever i wanted to
POD1000000042_S0000424	true
POD1000000042_S0000425	right
POD1000000042_S0000426	ciao
POD1000000042_S0000427	and it is very diverse like grapes are very diverse they taste different to me so i enjoy it so if you are a wine connoisseur or if you just like it or you are trying to get into it or whatever it is or if you just want good wine this is a really good place to go
POD1000000042_S0000428	it is you get 6 bottles for $30
POD1000000042_S0000429	for any level that you for a wine club for any level of experience with wine you have you can answer questions about random bullshit and they can tell you kind of what your flavor palette is but if you have more precise information you can do that as well
POD1000000042_S0000430	
POD1000000042_S0000431	and then it graduates so every new wine chip you get should be closer to your own particular taste which is good right that is how it should work particularly for people who have never used it before
POD1000000042_S0000432	that is the best way to get into something like that it is like having your own fucking wine butler basically
POD1000000042_S0000433	it is amazing so they will send you the 6 bottles you try them out you let them know if you like them and then you can continue on like that in the meantime again how are you going to turn down 6 bottles for $30
POD1000000042_S0000434	regardless of what your situation is
POD1000000042_S0000435	that is the holidays too dude
POD1000000042_S0000436	and it is also like curated wines as well
POD1000000042_S0000437	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000438	these are not like 2 buck chucks these are i guarantee you these these every single bottle in your fucking kit is going to be worth more than $5 per which is basically what you are paying
POD1000000042_S0000439	dude the last one i had there was not a bad wine in the bunch man my wife and i are huge fans go to tryfirstsleaf com forward slash drinkingbros that is tryfirstsleaf com forward slash drinkingbros if nothing else
POD1000000042_S0000440	thanksgiving and christmas is upon us 6 bottles for $30 you really can not beat it so you might as well load up for the holidays because lord knows you are going to need it
POD1000000042_S0000441	especially if your family is on 2 different sides of the political aisle
POD1000000042_S0000443	you do not have to worry about that dakota
POD1000000042_S0000444	nah i really i do not i do not

POD1000000042_S0000453	proud of you yeah i had a bunch this weekend man after this election i do not dan and i have shied away from the beers obviously as you hit your early 30s
POD1000000042_S0000454	yeah you will look like me
POD1000000042_S0000456	right dan
POD1000000042_S0000457	i will never get there
POD1000000042_S0000458	it is a lot of a lot of seltzers these days with this one i was like you know what i am going all in i was at twisted x brewery and yesterday
POD1000000042_S0000459	would you would you what were you hammering down
POD1000000042_S0000460	the big dogs they got some apvs that are 8% last night
POD1000000042_S0000461	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000462	i think is what it was called they have got the mcconaughey is they are famous for that one
POD1000000042_S0000463	i just do not like how bloated i feel for like 2 days afterwards like how fat i feel
POD1000000042_S0000464	that is the way i feel today but i also knew it right i was going into the weekend and i was like all right cool
POD1000000042_S0000465	you get the mindset
POD1000000042_S0000466	yeah because i did not find out dan and i collectively somebody tallied it up we did 58 hours worth of podcasts in the last 2 weeks i slept i was pretty sick like saturday my body just gave out i was pretty sick
POD1000000042_S0000467	and i slept most of the fucking weekend man and i did not find out about the election until i think like 6.30 that night saturday night when i woke up and i was like 0 shit they had actually called this
POD1000000042_S0000468	mike was talking about it a little bit earlier here what was your reaction to it you think it is real
POD1000000042_S0000469	0 which part
POD1000000042_S0000470	the like the the mail in balloting and
POD1000000042_S0000471	i mean look i think it is over right i mean the election is over this one is over i just hope that the republicans do not make the same mistake that i feel like the democrats did over the last 4 years and just try to fight out mistakes and i hope this is not their tagline
POD1000000042_S0000472	like russia was for the last 4 years i hope that look i do think we need to do justice to make sure that the system was that it was fair
POD1000000042_S0000473	
POD1000000042_S0000474	but at the end of the day like okay hey we lost we just need to say it okay we lost we got beat
POD1000000042_S0000475	right
POD1000000042_S0000476	we are going back to the drawing board let us do not play the victim card over the next 4 years
POD1000000042_S0000477	so that kind of begs the question of what is the point of all this right is the point for your team to win or is the point for america to win and it is why i challenge the binary political system itself
POD1000000042_S0000478	republican talking points versus left talking or liberal talking points into win versus lose or win versus lose depending on how you see the world right that is ridiculous
POD1000000042_S0000479	there are right and wrong answers to questions and we have somehow managed to pigeonhole ourselves into one of 2 choices and every fucking year people complain about it
POD1000000042_S0000480	can you believe we got to choose between these 2 assholes again it is because of you
POD1000000042_S0000481	yep
POD1000000042_S0000482	every bit of it is because of you it is because of you you me we are all assholes
POD1000000042_S0000483	but i mean yeah i mean i think our system i think this is probably the danger of democracy right like there is a danger to it like it is kind of like a gun
POD1000000042_S0000484	it can be a very very powerful tool that can feed your family protect your family it can literally be used for a lot of things right but it can also be the same thing that kills your entire family right in the wrong hands
POD1000000042_S0000485	and not used with integrity and not knowing the system being very familiar with the tool and all these things and what i think the problem is right now is that we have got a bunch of people who are not educated on how our system works
POD1000000042_S0000486	who are not educated on it and the people who are going and they are putting into power they are using this as some reality tv show or like they are betting on sunday night football right it is done with the same mindset
POD1000000042_S0000487	and what happens is with democracy it can be the best tool to give the freest country on the face of the planet but it can be a system that implodes on itself and turns everybody against each other because there is so much freedom right
POD1000000042_S0000488	communism is a more systematic bureaucratic approach to something right like it is regulated it is kind of like the military communism is kind of like how the military could be right
POD1000000042_S0000489	or socialism socialism is the military socialism pretty much socialism but when you have democracy and you have all this freedom and all this power you put it in the wrong hands
POD1000000042_S0000490	it can be the same the same thing that makes you free can also be the same thing that kills us
POD1000000042_S0000491	right it can i mean and that is why there will never be a successful socialist country ever is because it inevitably turns to communism now what we found about free market capitalism and things like that is it can thrive pretty well
POD1000000042_S0000492	without that happening without it turning to fascism for example which is a far right ideology but for some i do not know if it is a corrective measure that society is taken or whatever or if people are just weak
POD1000000042_S0000493	but it seems like the idea of individual responsibility is gone by the wayside for the most part
POD1000000042_S0000494	where there is no .
POD1000000042_S0000495	right
POD1000000042_S0000496	there is no accountability
POD1000000042_S0000497	right so you are afforded in america you are afforded the privilege it is not a right because people had to fight for this shit it is a privilege you are afforded the privilege of being able to live in a society like capitalism
POD1000000042_S0000498	without the bullshit from a society like socialism or communism where people are telling you what to do all the time that is what this is supposed to be but if you continue to not pay attention to what is going on .
POD1000000042_S0000499	and to allow these what seemed like simple comforts into your life at the time or maybe they are not bad enough to really go after
POD1000000042_S0000500	we have to focus on this goal of making sure that individual liberty is the most important and well respected facet of our entire system right otherwise we are fucked
POD1000000042_S0000501	but look what you are seeing across the board right now in our politics and across the world or across the board of america is the repercussions
POD1000000042_S0000502	of taking the easy road look at the baby boomers they were probably one of the 1st generations that decided to become the victims
POD1000000042_S0000503	
POD1000000042_S0000504	a greater dis yeah
POD1000000042_S0000505	i mean there is something about culture that once you become protected you start looking inward
POD1000000042_S0000506	exactly and so like they started they started that mindset and now their children started getting participation trophies right and now you look at the whole society that is voting right now
POD1000000042_S0000507	nobody wants to look in the mirror and say hey you know what i fucking lost so i need to go back and work on something
POD1000000042_S0000508	right no we are a bunch of dull blades
POD1000000042_S0000509	we are a bunch of dull blades
POD1000000042_S0000510	basically we have never seen steel before we have never been sharpened
POD1000000042_S0000511	but on the backside of it the military that we have and the 1st responder community that we have is 2nd to none and it is provided the same like we have empowered the problem
POD1000000042_S0000512	right because we have had men and women who have been willing to raise their right hands and did not have to we have had people willing to go out and and protect our society and still stand up and
POD1000000042_S0000513	when it is not popular in the court of public opinion people have still been willing to do this and we are basically enabling this behavior to continue we got police protecting the same people who are saying fuck the police
POD1000000042_S0000514	great
POD1000000042_S0000515	you know what i mean and so
POD1000000042_S0000516	and there is no social cost to be paid
POD1000000042_S0000518	and the props that is a problem
POD1000000042_S0000519	and the problem is is when there are no consequences to your actions and i blame 80% of this on one piece of america
POD1000000042_S0000520	and that is big tech
POD1000000042_S0000522	big tech
POD1000000042_S0000523	yeah yeah and i am with you until these things become public utilities
POD1000000042_S0000524	it is going to get worse and worse and worse and look we saw it in this election where i mean shit look between this and ross patterson revolution i have done around 1500 episodes of podcasts
POD1000000042_S0000525	i have never been censored before we have been shadow banned on this show that show i even had a social media post on facebook that was shadow banned this morning i did an election show
POD1000000042_S0000526	and there is something that pops up on youtube if you say the word election now that says the ap has called the election for joe biden and for more information on this and it was pointed out to by the listeners and i was
POD1000000042_S0000527	by the way it is not in the ap is power to call an election or any other media outlet it is only with the electors and the federal election commission to do that and that is not going to happen until at the earliest december 13th
POD1000000042_S0000528	and it and it right and it by the way so underneath it on youtube if you are if you are doing a video it it puts it has got a website on it c i s a governor slash rumor control i do not know if you guys know what this is i clicked it
POD1000000042_S0000529	and it says it is the national risk management for election security and it says mis and disinformation can undermine public confidence in the electoral process as well in our democracy
POD1000000042_S0000530	people will leave for that
POD1000000042_S0000531	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000532	wait for that
POD1000000042_S0000533	yeah you should have ran that ad 15 years ago
POD1000000042_S0000534	but they are doing it now currently now on videos on youtube and it keeps getting scarier and scarier where you are just like well what the fuck is next
POD1000000042_S0000535	well here is what i do not like i do not want when any kind of private organization and look we all support private business here but we have to be fucking pragmatist as well when any private organization gets that powerful then their voice becomes louder than yours
POD1000000042_S0000536	and when their voice becomes louder the government has 2 choices to listen to that voice or to develop a louder voice themselves and the only way the government develops a louder voice is by taking voice away from the people in both of these cases
POD1000000042_S0000537	okay
POD1000000042_S0000538	there is no good solution
POD1000000042_S0000539	but i do not know there is i disagree there is a good solution with big tech if i go buy a gun a gun has to be registered to somebody is name
POD1000000042_S0000540	right
POD1000000042_S0000541	it has to be
POD1000000042_S0000542	yes
POD1000000042_S0000543	right so if i am going to go and create an account on social media and use this platform that can be used to to to emotionally charge people into the mass you know gather people to do something for a cause
POD1000000042_S0000544	that should have to be registered to somebody is name because why is that gun registered to somebody is name so hold them accountable
POD1000000042_S0000545	so what you are describing is basically the way telephones work which is a public utility thing and it makes sense people hear the word register and that does not sit well with a lot of people
POD1000000042_S0000546	okay so it like
POD1000000042_S0000547	because how much how much power do we want the government to have do we not do we not want the capability to communicate with each other anonymously over the internet we have to have that
POD1000000042_S0000548	not what i am saying though that is not that is not what i am saying i am not saying the government has to be the one
POD1000000042_S0000549	right but who would it be then
POD1000000042_S0000550	well you know what if big tech if i am going to create a platform and it is going to be my platform then if if this account breaks the law
POD1000000042_S0000551	like they break the law that we already have set towards speech if i look at you and i say hey ross i am going to kill you you can go call the cops right now and i am going to jail because you have proof of it
POD1000000042_S0000552	right
POD1000000042_S0000553	right so the same thing should be with the same shit as text messages it should be the same thing with social media sites that if something is said that breaks the law there should be no censorship decided from a private party
POD1000000042_S0000554	if this account breaks the law then guess what i come to you as your big tech all you are is a vault and it is verified these people that is your responsibility as far as it goes to censorship
POD1000000042_S0000555	and i come to you and say who is this account registered to and then that person is held accountable for breaking the law
POD1000000042_S0000556	so instead of what section 230 does which is basically absolve people of our absolved tech companies of any illegal activity outside of their purview that may have happened on their platform
POD1000000042_S0000557	you would recommend something like the tech companies just being complicit or compliant rather with the government prosecuting case i understand that in principle
POD1000000042_S0000558	absolutely
POD1000000042_S0000559	but imagine a government where aoc is in charge and she is making lists of people who have supported trump
POD1000000042_S0000560	dude it is all but it is all but i am saying it but i am saying it is already
POD1000000042_S0000561	i know i got it i am just playing devil is avocado here because .
POD1000000042_S0000562	well then that goes back to the american people voting in people that they can trust that have that power
POD1000000042_S0000563	yeah but when have we done that who is the last fucking president that you trusted
POD1000000042_S0000564	then what do we do
POD1000000042_S0000565	i do not know that is a good question i think we need an overhaul of this entire electoral system
POD1000000042_S0000566	well i mean i think more the bigger problem to all this is that the fact that honestly this president is not going to change our 3 lives here this president is not going to make any decisions that is going to affect my life or change what i do every single day
POD1000000042_S0000567	it is going to have absolutely i do not invest in stocks so i do not give a shit about that i will bet i will gamble on my own money i will go and i will invest it in property or i will do it like that so that is going to be on my performance
POD1000000042_S0000568	like this this president is not going to affect it is going to affect absolutely nothing of the future for me
POD1000000042_S0000569	yeah and i have said this a bunch of times in the past where you know if you are this heated over a president right and it affects your life day to day chances are you got bigger problems right
POD1000000042_S0000570	because look
POD1000000042_S0000571	you are probably living off the government
POD1000000042_S0000572	well you say that but i mean .
POD1000000042_S0000573	let us think about our position specifically we are all business owners right if i decide to sell my business today then i pay 15% capital gains tax on it and the rest is mine
POD1000000042_S0000574	right
POD1000000042_S0000576	in 4 months there is a decent chance at least that that is going to be 23%
POD1000000042_S0000577	yes
POD1000000042_S0000578	right
POD1000000042_S0000579	yes
POD1000000042_S0000580	that affects my life
POD1000000042_S0000581	it does but day to day life and the idea that biden and his team are currently floating the idea that they are going to make mask wearing mandatory nationwide
POD1000000042_S0000582	i mean it did not
POD1000000042_S0000583	not that they have the constitutional authority to do anything like that sure the fact that they are even talking about it then yeah i mean
POD1000000042_S0000584	it is already there
POD1000000042_S0000585	you can say whatever the fuck you want about trump and how he sounds dictatorial sometimes because he is just an idiot that is negotiating in public and does not realize the weight of the words he says it does not make it right
POD1000000042_S0000586	but it does shed some light on why he would do something like that he is not doing those things to be malicious he is just doing it because he is a fucking emotional child and that is how he is learned to negotiate over the years and sometimes it is pretty goddamn effective frankly but even if it was not
POD1000000042_S0000587	it is just a strategy it is not who he is at the core of his person
POD1000000042_S0000588	so when i see people who at the core of their character are arguing for these certain things like i am going to be the champion of social justice now despite the fact that i wrote the bill
POD1000000042_S0000589	that put all these men in prison and that my fucking vice president enforced that bill in the biggest state in the country and suppressed evidence to keep people in prison and things like that
POD1000000042_S0000590	that should be an awakening right
POD1000000042_S0000591	yeah but to your point it has not happened yet
POD1000000042_S0000592	no i do not think it will
POD1000000042_S0000594	so after hillary losing maybe there was some chance if biden had lost here that that would have happened but now that biden won we are looking at another probably 20 years of just constant
POD1000000042_S0000595	no
POD1000000042_S0000596	fracture of the democratic party
POD1000000042_S0000597	well yeah yeah yeah i mean look i mean look the democrats lost it no matter how you look at it right they lost seats in the house yeah i mean you know if the democrats do not go back and say you know
POD1000000042_S0000598	we barely like like donald trump got beat we did not win kind of like the republicans probably should have done as well last you know last time
POD1000000042_S0000599	i mean both of them have got to have a major overhaul but here is what i got to tell you is .
POD1000000042_S0000600	well the republicans did do it they came back out of losing to obama for a 2nd time against mitt romney and they came out with donald trump and won
POD1000000042_S0000601	right
POD1000000042_S0000602	they made the adjustment
POD1000000042_S0000603	but i also think that was an accident i also think that that was as much i
POD1000000042_S0000604	i do not think the rnc wanted that to happen
POD1000000042_S0000605	no they definitely did not want that to happen yeah
POD1000000042_S0000606	but so my thing to you is okay let us say as soon as whatever happens the judicial system comes out and decides whoever is president is either way
POD1000000042_S0000607	if it is joe biden which i truly believe at this point the election is over we have got to stop talking about what they have done before
POD1000000042_S0000608	and we have just got to hope for the goodness of this nation that they come out and have learned from the mistakes and that they are going to do better over the next 4 years
POD1000000042_S0000609	that is all we can do like if we do not do that then we are just as bad as the left like we are just as bad as the you know what i mean like we have got to hope that
POD1000000042_S0000610	well how do you how do you balance that though how do you decide what to support and what not to support for example
POD1000000042_S0000611	well how do you pick how do you decide when donald trump does something you got to forgive him for this shit
POD1000000042_S0000612	the crime i got all that yeah for sure but like how do you what what is the line here if if the if the democrats if the democrats win
POD1000000042_S0000613	which it seems to be the case we will see how much voter fraud we know there is a lot of voter fraud we do not know how much or if it will be enough to swing anything but anyways it seems like they are going to win if they win
POD1000000042_S0000614	there are things that these guys have talked about that are untenable for the american economy
POD1000000042_S0000615	you are right
POD1000000042_S0000616	shutting down i am not a fan of fracking i am not a fan of long oil pipelines because they present unnecessary environmental challenges that to me is laziness we could figure out a better way to do it we just have not put the effort towards it we put the effort towards
POD1000000042_S0000617	and money towards nonsensical fucking energy substitutions that are not feasible at this period in time we have not figured out better ways to do what we are doing already we are just trying to find out new ways which is stupid but anyways
POD1000000042_S0000618	aside from stuff like that the green new deal that kamala harris was a co author of right that biden says 0 no no no but look he is supported it in theory right in the past
POD1000000042_S0000619	and all this other stuff that is coming with that party i want the country to succeed and this is a good learning lesson for conservatives right now
POD1000000042_S0000620	because from the perspective of a liberal democrat in 2016 in november of 2016 they have a set of core beliefs that they think are going to make this country the best it could be
POD1000000042_S0000622	trump was the complete opposite of that and their response was to just lose their fucking minds now that is not always the case so let us say you are riding a train through the city
POD1000000042_S0000623	like you are on the wrong line but then you look at the map and i can go up 2 more and then swap over
POD1000000042_S0000624	this train is still moving generally in the direction you need it to move so how do i fucking guide this thing the best i can or make adjustments
POD1000000042_S0000625	in the meantime because but there is a line though right like if they start talking about green new deal or or nationwide mandating of certain things that it is unconstitutional that is going to be a fucking problem for a lot of people yeah
POD1000000042_S0000627	look let us let us do not take an aspirin before we got a headache right like let us start this off with the best mindset like we do not need this emotionally charged like we do not need to like look let us let us do not be the same thing that we just bitched about the last 4 years
POD1000000042_S0000628	well it is hard i get what you are saying but it is hard it is hard not to do that when aoc and her colleagues are talking about making lists of people who support trump i was not a trump supporter
POD1000000042_S0000629	i got it
POD1000000042_S0000630	and i am not and i am obviously not an aoc supporter either but if either one of those sides started making lists of the other side i am going to have a fucking problem with that and all of you should too
POD1000000042_S0000631	well we are talking about big we are talking about we are talking about different issues right like
POD1000000042_S0000632	well we are when the leaders of the party like michelle obama as well as like these people these 70 people decided to vote for chaos and racism how about you shut the fuck up michelle well like that i mean that is like she is one of the leader regardless of having never run for politics in her life
POD1000000042_S0000633	she is one of the leaders of the democratic party and what she says means a lot so she just called out 70 people and told them that they are fucking racist like how do you expect all they talk about right now is 0 we need to unify and stuff yeah of course
POD1000000042_S0000634	you want to unify right now while you are winning in the game you do not want there to be any more violence
POD1000000042_S0000635	i am with you listen i am with you i am with you but all we can hope is that over the next 4 years that we can at least lead by example
POD1000000042_S0000636	that we do not turn around and we do not grab guns and we do not go and we do not start holding guns to where people can not count outside of voting centers you know what i mean i am going to say on the backside of it both sides are fucked up
POD1000000042_S0000637	right
POD1000000042_S0000638	right so like i am just saying as far as us we have a responsibility we have a platform we have a responsibility to look let us okay i got we said we were in a fight like we are in a fight
POD1000000042_S0000639	we said what we needed to to get there but it is time to like hey like clean slate let us see what we are going to do going forward like let us see what we are going to do going forward
POD1000000042_S0000640	i am going to reserve getting angry until the actual policies are in place and things like that
POD1000000042_S0000641	unless it happens by executive order nothing is going to happen
POD1000000042_S0000642	that is what i think too
POD1000000042_S0000643	we have got a stalemate president for the next 4 years
POD1000000042_S0000644	yeah because this is the 1st time
POD1000000042_S0000645	it is going to be yeah for at least .
POD1000000042_S0000646	at least 4 years
POD1000000042_S0000648	no republicans are definitely going to flip the house in 2022 because let us just be real honest about what is going to happen even if anything biden was going to push would have made some positive dent
POD1000000042_S0000649	he may ride the wave from post covid and it will inflate the way his numbers look the same way that trump is looked after obama is policies brought us out of a recession let us be real about that
POD1000000042_S0000650	sustaining it is important right biden probably will not be able to because we know how these policies work but in 2022 he will be riding that downward wave and republicans will take the house and
POD1000000042_S0000651	we will see what happens i mean joe biden is a statesman he is a weird guy sniffs people very bizarre
POD1000000042_S0000653	he is existed in dc which is a fucking hornet is nest for 50 years which is in itself impressive i think it is wrong that we have people to serve that long but it is impressive to be able to stay keep your head above water for that amount of time
POD1000000042_S0000654	so he is going to adjust i think the problem is not him the problem is kamala harris
POD1000000042_S0000655	well i got you and look and all i can look here is here is our best in my opinion best case scenario if biden wins is it biden lives another 4 years
POD1000000042_S0000656	can state like we do not want him we do not want kamala harris going being able to take over
POD1000000042_S0000657	i mean she will not what would even happen the senate does not the senate have to confirm a new vp so they probably would not even have a vp for the last 2 years if it happened i mean
POD1000000042_S0000658	but what i hope is is i hope if anything if anything this next 4 years like obviously they probably will not pass much they probably will not change much i think we know that but man my hope for this country is is that if he does anything
POD1000000042_S0000659	that he can at least let america calm down like and so like we are so emotionally charged right now and look and i am going to i am going to put a lot of that on donald trump like he is emotionally exhausted us as a nation
POD1000000042_S0000660	that everything has to be a fight and i got it is both sides
POD1000000042_S0000661	i do not think it is all him to blame
POD1000000042_S0000662	i do not think it is all hand of mine
POD1000000042_S0000663	challenged the establishment so much they came out and said everything he does is racist or sexist or whatever the fuck
POD1000000042_S0000664	i got you but i think he could have handled it a little bit different
POD1000000042_S0000665	yeah but he never would have he is donald trump right so there is no he does not have that in his toolbox
POD1000000042_S0000666	so that is my hope is that biden will at least take it down a notch of not charging of doing some of this dirty fighting behind closed doors
POD1000000042_S0000667	that you can you can you can bet on right yeah cuz his statements are going to be very limited and very shortened anyways and somebody else will be running the twitter feed
POD1000000042_S0000668	well imagine your household with your kids if you are fighting with your wife in front of the kids
POD1000000042_S0000669	
POD1000000042_S0000670	it is tension everywhere right everybody is walking on eggshells and this and that hopefully they can act as adults
POD1000000042_S0000671	it does put a little pressure on you particularly as a man i think
POD1000000042_S0000672	yes
POD1000000042_S0000673	but maybe even still as a woman in congress or the senate
POD1000000042_S0000674	senate to respond aggressively if you are spoken to aggressively because it appears weak
POD1000000042_S0000675	i mean imagine a cop walking up and saying hey motherfucker what are you doing what do you think you are doing you are not going to sit here and be like 0 well sir
POD1000000042_S0000676	yeah i would be like i am minding my goddamn business
POD1000000042_S0000678	what the fuck are you doing
POD1000000042_S0000680	last but not least here i wanted to chat with you guys about the covid miracle that happened today
POD1000000042_S0000682	what a coincidence
POD1000000042_S0000683	which is what donald trump gave all the money to and says hey man we have it we have got the cure and we are 90% right now we are going to have about 50 of these guys out into the world in january
POD1000000042_S0000684	to me because dan rails on this all the time that big pharma is always in bed with democrats this was a big fat fuck you from big pharma to donald trump saying
POD1000000042_S0000685	well he is the only one that is taken him to court trying to get drug prices lowered he is the only one trying to have these other bargaining schedules that you can buy drugs from and stuff like that he is definitely taken them on and they made him pay for it
POD1000000042_S0000686	and he took on big tech and they made him pay for that too
POD1000000042_S0000687	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000688	let us be real about this the reason donald trump did not get reelected is not because people do not like the way he talks right because
POD1000000042_S0000689	took everybody to task
POD1000000042_S0000690	because when we come on this show and talk the way we talk we get more viewers the more authentic we are the more viewers we get and he is there is no more authentic american than donald trump let us be real for better or worse
POD1000000042_S0000691	yeah i know
POD1000000042_S0000692	back for at least 2 years
POD1000000042_S0000693	he never held back
POD1000000042_S0000694	like a fucking a dude from new york that has got a fucking attitude about him but he is also been successful of course he is going to get an even bigger attitude blah blah blah now he is in his 70s and he is a billionaire how the fuck do you think he is going to act right it made perfect sense however
POD1000000042_S0000695	that all that stuff his personnel i do not i do not believe that i do not believe people voted against trump because he is coarse when he speaks i think it is a coordinated effort from all these very
POD1000000042_S0000696	look if the pharmaceutical industry that has been trying to buttfuck you for years and is very successful in doing so since 83% of all privately filed bankruptcies are filed because of unpaid medical expenses
POD1000000042_S0000697	and tech companies who we know have done everything they can to go out of their way to exploit our data and sell that information off to people do you think either one of those people are working for your best interest right now there is no fucking way right
POD1000000042_S0000698	so that is why it always brings me back to this same conclusion i am not a trump supporter however it would have been a lot better for the country had he been reelected
POD1000000042_S0000699	and for a lot of different reasons
POD1000000042_S0000700	and i think it was one hour let me just double down on this
POD1000000042_S0000701	yeah
POD1000000042_S0000702	it was one hour after the us stated that they had the coronavirus vaccine that russia
POD1000000042_S0000704	they had it too 90% effective one hour afterwards

POD1000000043_S0000032	all right let us get to the news less than a year after the 1st documented coronavirus infection in the united states the food and drug administration just authorized pfizer is covid 19 vaccine for emergency use
POD1000000043_S0000033	and the initial injections have begun today marking the launch of the largest vaccination effort in american history
POD1000000043_S0000034	the doses will be distributed based on each state is adult population and the states themselves would decide who gets vaccinated 1st with frontline health care workers expected to be at the front of the line
POD1000000043_S0000035	the 1st shipment of 30 doses enough to inoculate 150 people were flown out of grand rapids michigan on sunday after being transported from one of pfizer is nearby facilities
POD1000000043_S0000036	and here is a clip of the crowd that gathered to watch the vaccine leave the warehouse
POD1000000043_S0000038	it is just nice to see a group of people cheering science and not trying to burn scientists at the stake
POD1000000043_S0000040	that clip was not anything special for listeners it could have been any crowd but it is not often we have been able to talk about good news here especially in 2020 on pod save america
POD1000000043_S0000041	so thought we would play that clip love it you have any thoughts on the scope and speed of this scientific achievement and how it came to be
POD1000000043_S0000043	yeah you know there is a i actually really really recommend there was a deep deep dive in the washington post
POD1000000043_S0000044	and that was i think pretty fair in looking at the achievement operation warp speed trump is impact his negative impact
POD1000000043_S0000046	inside of that piece and i do not want to just make it about trump but i do think that there is something important in it because you know inside of that piece which is really about like
POD1000000043_S0000048	this is one of the greatest achievements in the history of science really is and it is born of an incredible focus over the last year it is born of decades of investment in the public sector and basic research in
POD1000000043_S0000049	in systems that try to prevent the influence of politics of corporate influence and interference on science the building of public health infrastructure of trust in institutions like all of that
POD1000000043_S0000050	but then there is this
POD1000000043_S0000052	administration official in the piece and they are quoted as saying something along the lines of in 20 years people will not remember bleach they will not remember him not wearing masks they will not remember this they will just remember operation warp speed
POD1000000043_S0000053	and i saw that and i was like 00 okay i so you know wishing is not going to make that happen and what was striking to me in seeing the trucks
POD1000000043_S0000055	it was bittersweet to me i was watching the videos on repeat
POD1000000043_S0000056	because what else am i going to do and what i was thinking when i saw it is
POD1000000043_S0000058	look at this incredible achievement that like these scientists and government were able to do together it took everything that trump hates it took discipline it took belief in institutions it took not allowing political interference it took public involvement
POD1000000043_S0000060	math science
POD1000000043_S0000061	and all of those things human ingenuity human creativity human discipline it was enough to overcome the virus and that is extraordinary but it was not enough to overcome trump it was not enough to overcome the failure of leadership
POD1000000043_S0000062	the failure to give people resources to survive the failure to have enough masks the failure to model best practices the failure to model good behavior the failure to celebrate the people that were doing the right thing the failure to help the people that were doing the right thing
POD1000000043_S0000063	because there was no reason that this vaccine would come at a time in which the virus was completely unchecked in this country and that is trump is great failure
POD1000000043_S0000064	and it is a tribute to every single person who was involved in making this vaccine happen that they were able to overcome the absence of leadership
POD1000000043_S0000065	that has been basically the only consistent thing trump has offered up and until him pretending to be a leader by badgering officials to make the vaccine roll out faster just before it is approved
POD1000000043_S0000066	so that he could claim some credit and get himself in the news cycle it ends as it began
POD1000000043_S0000067	tell me what do you think do you think we will still remember the bleach in 20 years
POD1000000043_S0000069	the idea that any of these people can predict what we will or will not remember in 20 i feel like in 20 years our kids are going to be like so wait you guys could have put kleenex on your face and not had 30 people died and you chose not to what is what is wrong with you like you know so anyway
POD1000000043_S0000070	that idiot is an idiot on a personal level i just feel like it has been like really nice for all of our mental health to wake up and read these stories and see these photos right i mean hannah and i canceled our plans to see her family around thanksgiving
POD1000000043_S0000071	we are staying in la over christmas instead of going to see my mom and my sister and my brother in boston and it sucks right i mean holidays are a big deal to us they are to everybody but you know finally there is there is light at the end of the tunnel here
POD1000000043_S0000072	and to levitt is point i mean this vaccine is a miracle 95% effective and created in record time i mean we are so so lucky that is so much faster than anything in history
POD1000000043_S0000073	it is way more effective than your standard flu vaccine so this is a miracle and we should be clear the pfizer vaccine was developed by a german couple
POD1000000043_S0000074	right one of them was born in turkey and emigrated to germany when he was 4 the other is the daughter of turkish immigrants to germany so for all of trump is credit grab we have germans and immigrants to thank for this pfizer vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000075	the operation warp speed folks deserve some credit for buying 10 doses of the pfizer vaccine they deserve our eternal hatred and shame for passing on up to 40 doses at no cost to the us i mean we could have just like paid when we got it right
POD1000000043_S0000076	but you know it is an extraordinary scientific feat there is some really interesting research about how in the future we might be able to speed up this process even more and we might be able to pre prepare vaccines for almost all the major known viruses out there
POD1000000043_S0000077	we could maybe create a vaccine for 50 to 100 of the most dangerous prominent viruses for the cost of the f 35 fighter jet program so that seems like a pretty good deal compared to a plane we may or may not need to use
POD1000000043_S0000078	so lots of good news today feeling really good about this and it was nice to see people feeling less scared basically
POD1000000043_S0000079	so i just remember in april when this started doctor fauci said 12 to 18 months for a vaccine hopefully
POD1000000043_S0000080	and there were a bunch of epidemiologists scientists and others saying that fauci is timeline was way too optimistic for 12 to 18 months 11 months that is what this vaccine came in 11 months
POD1000000043_S0000081	the shortest timeline previously for any vaccine ever was the mumps vaccine which took 4 years that was the record and we have gone from 4 years to 11 months and like you know tommy you just mentioned about the 95% effective
POD1000000043_S0000082	fda was ready to approve a vaccine that was over 50% effective the number of people that expected 95% effective i mean it truly is a miracle
POD1000000043_S0000083	there were headlines back in the spring saying like we may never get a vaccine so no i had the same kind of hope and optimism
POD1000000043_S0000084	this section is john basically being so mad at like a series of articles in the atlantic that were so annoying over the course of many months it was like the doom and gloom publication of choice for several months
POD1000000043_S0000085	i have been holding back on this
POD1000000043_S0000087	the atlantic has some of like the best journalists in the world and writes some of the best fucking stuff in the world but the number of doomsday you can just google them the number of doomsday headlines in that fucking publication about how we are going to live forever with this and never go be the same is ridiculous
POD1000000043_S0000088	but anyway
POD1000000043_S0000090	no so i was very hopeful and optimistic too and kind of what you were saying
POD1000000043_S0000092	like it
POD1000000043_S0000093	it really speaks to the fact that our world is politics and we talk so much about politics and we are obsessed with politics and politics is really broken and the brokenness of politics has contributed to the death and disaster that has come from this pandemic
POD1000000043_S0000094	but other parts of society are not broken science is not broken like this was a feat of science and just like a modern miracle that that we should celebrate
POD1000000043_S0000095	even though politics failed us
POD1000000043_S0000097	every other way every other way
POD1000000043_S0000098	well i also i also just say to that like foushee said basically that he was going to see this vaccine to the end
POD1000000043_S0000099	and
POD1000000043_S0000100	a
POD1000000043_S0000101	despite the the headwinds that were presented by his boss despite the incredible obstacles set up by donald trump to make sure that this came to an end and like he is a real you know he is a hero
POD1000000043_S0000103	yes so trump did publicly pressure the fda to speed up the approval process from saturday to friday and his chief of staff reportedly threatened to fire fda commissioner stephen hahn if that did not happen you guys see any problems with that
POD1000000043_S0000104	i mean yeah look let us just talk about this issue of credit for a minute because there is a there is a debate going on too but like
POD1000000043_S0000105	when we are talking about the pfizer vaccine the us deserves credit for making an advance purchase of that vaccine in july they got 10 doses
POD1000000043_S0000106	well i already mentioned how angry i am that they did not advance purchase several 10 more doses but whatever
POD1000000043_S0000107	but the thing that is incredible again about the moderna vaccine is that that vaccine was designed january 13th 2020 we have had this vaccine formula in our hands for the entire year
POD1000000043_S0000108	because a very brave chinese doctor sequenced the genome and publicized it and these advances in mrna technology that none of us actually understand but it allowed us to pull this off so quickly and now the problem becomes logistics
POD1000000043_S0000109	but i mean in terms of like threatening the fda chief i mean there is a huge problem with that i mean even the term operation warp speed is horribly problematic if you think about it from a medical point of view
POD1000000043_S0000110	like we know trump wants credit for the vaccine being developed quickly but this is not fast food like no one is really pumped about like a rushed medical product right like no one is getting the fastest created tylenol ever
POD1000000043_S0000112	it is a bad idea to talk about this and to talk about it as something that happened quickly or in a rushed manner and so going even further to politicize the approval process is a bad idea
POD1000000043_S0000113	when you have got like you know obviously there is some subsets of the anti vaxxer community that are kind of super aggressive and dangerous and spread misinformation
POD1000000043_S0000114	but then there is other people especially in the black community who have read about the tuskegee syphilis study and have some understandable hesitation based on that history about a new drug
POD1000000043_S0000115	so this is going to require a serious science based public awareness campaign and that is really important because there is a lot of people in this country who desperately want a vaccine but can not have it
POD1000000043_S0000116	right like if you are getting chemotherapy you can not get the vaccine if you are under 16 as of right now you can not take the vaccine it is not clear when it is going to be approved for pregnant women
POD1000000043_S0000117	and so if the virus is swirling around the country because a bunch of vaccine eligible people just refuse to take it that will put others at risk
POD1000000043_S0000118	and so that is why you know it is just it is horrible that we have to read these stories over and over again of trump politicizing the process when if he had just shut up and stepped back and let the process work things would be better
POD1000000043_S0000119	in fact pfizer did not take operation warp speed money because they were worried that the government might slow them down
POD1000000043_S0000121	yeah i mean like trump is the worst offender here but it is going to be a major challenge to get the public communication around this correct you know even for the biden administration who is going to approach it in good faith you know
POD1000000043_S0000122	even the fda approval process it was not a unanimous decision and some people were like why did some members of the panel vote against it well it turns out the people who voted against it were just saying 0 i do not think it is ready for 16 and 17 year olds
POD1000000043_S0000124	2 specific ages but it is like that is the kind of thing that you actually need to make sure you communicate clearly to people because if you just see a number 0 some people voted against it you think it is dangerous it is not it is just they had a problem with the ages so far you know
POD1000000043_S0000125	so there is going to be like there is no such thing as too much public communication around this vaccination effort and it really has to be consistent and done very well
POD1000000043_S0000126	well i mean look there was something such a to me was such like a signal example of what trump has done throughout this period because yeah he was complaining that 0 they held back the saying that the vaccine worked
POD1000000043_S0000127	because they did not want to help me in my election right that was just in the past couple of weeks but this was like
POD1000000043_S0000129	he knew the approval was going to happen it had nothing to do with him he was not going to speed it up he was not really going to slow it down the vaccine was going to be delivered on monday
POD1000000043_S0000130	so we like hector and hector and hector to achieve some made up results so that he could look like a tv president
POD1000000043_S0000132	the other piece of this too is there is a lot of stuff that should have been happened that has not happened right like
POD1000000043_S0000133	there should be a public campaign going on right now that does not exist about how the vaccine is going to be distributed where it is going to go like there is all the aspects of presidential leadership that have just been completely missing right
POD1000000043_S0000134	like it is why there are not enough n 95 masks right now it is why there may be supply problems down the line with the vaccine and it is why right now we do not know how people will get it
POD1000000043_S0000135	we do not know where it is going to go we do not know the process because there has been no public education and some of this has not even been fully thought out
POD1000000043_S0000137	pots of america is brought to you by helix some ideas for jokes add intros not being able to sleep because of today is politics pandemics your love life any other drama you talk about in your show what other drama do we talk about

POD1000000043_S0000198	trump administration officials have said they hope to vaccinate up to 240 americans by mid january and joe biden has set a goal of 10 vaccinations within his 1st 100 days which would bring us to the end of april
POD1000000043_S0000199	what are some of the bigger challenges in getting every american inoculated as quickly as possible you know we have already covered sort of the demand side of it which is making sure that enough people want it and trust it but what are some of the other other issues involved in this tommy
POD1000000043_S0000200	i mean i think it is this is now just a massive logistical issue you know when you think about 10 20 50 doses if everybody needs 2 of them all of those doses need to be contained in a little vial
POD1000000043_S0000201	and they all need to be manufactured and they all need to be shipped somewhere and they all need to be doled out by states that are really short on cash and so it really is like thank god joe biden and his team are coming in because it really is just about competency
POD1000000043_S0000202	and so that is where you know again i feel a little more hopeful i mean i feel hopeful in a lot of ways with joe biden and not trump but it is something we should all feel hopeful about that maybe we can speed up these timelines
POD1000000043_S0000203	i guess the thing i do not understand and look i am totally out of my depth here is why the us government is not using the defense production act to maybe aid in manufacturing or distribution of the vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000204	i am not saying that they should do what trump seems to be attempting to do with his executive order which is use the dpa or use the government to say hey pfizer all your doses are for us they are not for other countries that is immoral
POD1000000043_S0000205	and it is not feasible because they manufacture a lot of these doses outside the country too but like at a minimum we could use the dpa to ramp up production of ppe
POD1000000043_S0000206	or we could use military assets to ship some of these vaccines especially the ones that need to be stored at super cold temperatures we could ramp up the availability and frequency of testing
POD1000000043_S0000207	to do a better job of identifying outbreaks i mean i do think like the thing we were just talking about was the broken messaging and clarity about what is going to happen and what is going to expect and the biden team will fix that
POD1000000043_S0000208	along those lines i mean i think one of the best things that you know the media could do is commit to not reporting on or amplifying trump is covid related lies or misinformation
POD1000000043_S0000209	starting the day he leaves office you know what i mean he is like the biggest problem in terms of vaccine hesitation right now and we should all agree that we are moving on from this asshole if you are not a fox news host
POD1000000043_S0000210	i sort of get the sense that the dpa is like and it is tough to figure this out now because we still have the trump administration here and we do not know what the biden administration is going to do but it is almost like a last resort thing that you use
POD1000000043_S0000211	if all of the different private companies are not cooperating and doing what you want them to do fast enough and of course it is like there is a whole supply chain issue right so there is supply of the vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000212	but there is glass vials syringes needles cooling systems ultra cold freezers gps thermal sensors i mean if you read some of these stories about what they have to do to get the vaccine around it is incredible and it is like so much more than just needing enough actual vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000213	so the coordination and logistics are just like mind boggling also delivering them right like you need the 1st batch of vaccines are going to hospitals that can handle ultra cold storage which is not every hospital
POD1000000043_S0000214	trucks that can handle ultra cold storage which is certainly not every truck
POD1000000043_S0000215	and then you have the issue where it is like going to be harder to reach rural and underserved areas that just do not have the right health care capacity how do you get it to them when you do not have the right trucks and hospitals there like it is a it is a biden administration has quite a challenge on it
POD1000000043_S0000216	we need the moderna approval to come through because that can be stored at more regular temperatures and that will i think help
POD1000000043_S0000217	for sure
POD1000000043_S0000218	and i do sort of wish astrazeneca had not just told doctors to kind of you know give people 2 or 3 fingers worth you know what i mean
POD1000000043_S0000220	2 fingers for most people 3 fingers if you are like you are you know really thirsty for the vaccine
POD1000000043_S0000222	because not great not great and i wonder what is going on with johnson johnson come on johnson johnson
POD1000000043_S0000223	tommy you said this a couple times but we really should hit on it the fact that the trump administration could have bought 40 more doses from pfizer
POD1000000043_S0000224	have the chance in july and then i did not realize until i saw scott gottlieb the former fda commissioner was on cnbc this morning saying
POD1000000043_S0000225	as late as november this november the trump administration had another chance to buy another 40 doses and did not and we still do not know why i keep looking for him
POD1000000043_S0000226	are we just is this hyperbole are we like not no no there is no explanation anywhere as far as i can tell of why they passed up in november the chance to buy another 40 doses
POD1000000043_S0000227	i get that they are hedging their bets and buying from a bunch of companies but again
POD1000000043_S0000228	right
POD1000000043_S0000229	but in the grand scheme of things 1st of all i think we had to make the payment upon receipt of the doses so if we did not get them from pfizer we would not have to pay the money but in the grand scheme of things spending another $80 on vaccine doses is nothing
POD1000000043_S0000230	nothing compared to the cost in lives in our economy and everything else it is baffling it is absolutely mind boggling it is baffling i do not get how this happened this is a fuck up of just epic proportion
POD1000000043_S0000231	and i do not know hopefully we will figure out who did it i bet the email was just like unopened in jared is inbox somewhere with one of his you know his college roommates you know told him not to do it or something
POD1000000043_S0000232	yeah i have been looking too it is like there is really is you can not find any plausible explanation because it was not the money was no risk there was no risk
POD1000000043_S0000234	if it worked
POD1000000043_S0000235	and i was like were they worried about getting the super cold version where they were also counting on moderna astrazeneca johnson johnson is there any explanation so far there has been no explanation whatsoever
POD1000000043_S0000236	none
POD1000000043_S0000237	it is crazy
POD1000000043_S0000238	and of course states do not have any money left because of this recession and they have been begging for local and state aid for months that mitch mcconnell is holding up single handedly in fact he is holding up the entire covid relief bill over this
POD1000000043_S0000239	because he does not want states to get a penny of additional money it does seem to me like democrats should just hammer this issue relentlessly and turn the state and local aid issue into an issue about vaccine distribution to states
POD1000000043_S0000240	yeah i mean just before we were recording it looked like some of the negotiators were putting out kind of 2 versions right they were going to put out the version of the bill that was just the relief portion and they were going to separate out
POD1000000043_S0000241	the state aid and the liability portion
POD1000000043_S0000242	because they probably know that that is not going to pass and they are like all right we will just fucking set that loose
POD1000000043_S0000243	well it does seem like if we if we really are separating out liability and state and local aid it does seem to doom liability protections and state and local aid because mitch mcconnell will not budge on state on state and local aid democrats obviously do not want liability protections
POD1000000043_S0000244	i do not care what that negotiation looks like it is a maddening thing i talked to schatz about it in love it or leave it and it really is
POD1000000043_S0000245	as it is worth remembering this is taking a really important part of protecting people and helping people during this crisis and adding a completely unrelated thing of immunizing corporations
POD1000000043_S0000246	which does nothing to help us get out of this crisis but it does seem as though separating those things out makes both far less likely to happen while making direct payments maybe more plausible i do not know
POD1000000043_S0000247	i just one of the things that drives me the most insane about washington is that it is all about expectations management when in terms of press coverage right so like the worst you are as a human being
POD1000000043_S0000248	the more terrible you are consistently the less likely you are to get hammered over an issue like this and when it comes to mitch mcconnell he has spent months refusing to engage with democrats over covid relief period and now he wants to punish states
POD1000000043_S0000249	because their finances have been decimated by lockdowns that were made necessary by a federal response that was absolutely miserable and again like love mentioned his top priority is liability protection for businesses
POD1000000043_S0000250	what like mitch mcconnell has blood on his hands people are waiting for hours in food lines because of mitch mcconnell right like states have to decide who gets this vaccine 1st they have to distribute it they have to do all these logistics and he is preventing them from getting that money
POD1000000043_S0000251	right now mitch mcconnell is blocking a bipartisan bill to prevent patients who have insurance from getting surprise medical bills for unexpected out of network or emergency care why
POD1000000043_S0000252	because he cares more about private equity backed insurance company profits than regular people mcconnell is one of the worst people in political history he is disgusting he is a corporate stooge he is cynical
POD1000000043_S0000253	and like the coverage of him in how he acts is talked about as sort of savvy or tough and impressive the reality is he is a monster he is a monster he is a bad legislator all he does is block shit everything they do is via some
POD1000000043_S0000255	you get punished for trying you know what i mean it is like everyone is hammering pelosi online for engaging or not engaging fucking tweeting out pictures of the amount of ice cream she has in her freezer like mitch mcconnell is the clear enemy he has been all along
POD1000000043_S0000257	but this is this drives me nuts it is like and you know why mitch mcconnell is going to get his way on this and this deal is probably going to pass with all of the shit that he wants in it or does not want in it is because he has got the fucking numbers and he has got donald trump in the white house like i said you know
POD1000000043_S0000258	bernie sanders said the deal is bad and we should not support the deal and i agree with him in the sense that the deal is fucking bad the bipartisan compromise is bad
POD1000000043_S0000259	now that they have separated state and local aid and liability protections what is left over is even more inadequate than the bipartisan compromise it is shit for sure but like
POD1000000043_S0000260	what is the choice here you are not going to negotiate a better package with these republicans who are you going to get to vote for more money you are going to get susan collins and mitt romney to vote for more money and lisa murkowski no they said this is as best that they would do
POD1000000043_S0000261	and if you do not take the deal and we do not win georgia we are not going to get a better deal when joe biden is president and joe biden is not going to have a mechanism to force a better deal because mitch mcconnell is going to sit there and say fuck you i have the numbers i do not have to pass a deal
POD1000000043_S0000262	if they really do pull out state and local aid and they pull out the liability protections which obviously none of us think should be part of this at all makes no sense and they have said from the beginning they will not do a $10 i mean keep in mind democrats right we have come down from
POD1000000043_S0000264	to $20 to $150 now we are trying to get to $10 what i do not know is what happens if they replace the state and local aid as it was drafted with direct payments does that become something that gets people like bernie back on board
POD1000000043_S0000265	i do not know maybe maybe you try that i mean bernie is one thing but like like josh hawley or some of these republicans who want direct payments yeah i would i would try to get as much in there as i could you know and i would try to push more direct payments for sure but like at the end of the day
POD1000000043_S0000266	i would also take whatever is left because something is better than nothing for people who are struggling even though it is not money
POD1000000043_S0000267	i mean look congress does not do anything well anymore what they do is they jam every bill they are ever supposed to pass together in what is called an omnibus and the deadline for that bill which is currently i think 140 with the t dollars is friday
POD1000000043_S0000268	or else the government shuts down they are going to try to jam whatever like covid relief measures they can into that and that is kind of like the best and only shot we are going to have until february march i do not know
POD1000000043_S0000270	i also what i was going to say is yeah that is exactly right and so like this
POD1000000043_S0000272	if there is going to be something close to a $10 relief bill it will be inadequate it will be terribly inadequate and people will be suffering next year
POD1000000043_S0000273	and if what you are doing is replacing state and local aid with direct payments to people you are kind of changing where that inadequacy and where that pain will be felt
POD1000000043_S0000274	and basically what you are saying is next year you want states and localities to be put in incredibly difficult positions right as hopefully we are emerging from this to cut transportation cut schools cut public health
POD1000000043_S0000275	cut to fund the police something republicans seem to believe is something that they oppose and every other local service so it really is like
POD1000000043_S0000276	because we are talking about a completely inadequate stimulus no matter what happens we are really just talking about who do we want to unnecessarily subject to pain
POD1000000043_S0000278	you want an adequate stimulus vote for 2 democrats in georgia that is how we are going to get an adequate
POD1000000043_S0000280	of the past year
POD1000000043_S0000281	as the founders intended
POD1000000043_S0000282	literally
POD1000000043_S0000283	you gather and hide
POD1000000043_S0000285	with police protection yeah exactly sorry sorry sorry i am i am i am too hot today
POD1000000043_S0000286	it is a day that it is a day that usually passes without much fanfare except for this year when donald trump and most republican politicians in congress have so far refused to accept the results of a presidential election for the 1st time in american history
POD1000000043_S0000287	even though their false conspiracies about voter fraud have essentially been unanimously rejected by election officials and judges from across the political spectrum liberal and conservative democrat and republican
POD1000000043_S0000288	the latest and likely last legal challenge to invalidate every ballot cast in 4 battleground states was rejected by the us supreme court only 2 justices clarence thomas and samuel alito believe the court was obligated to hear such a case
POD1000000043_S0000289	but even they refused to hear this particular pile of steaming garbage they were like yeah basically these kind of cases i do not know if we can shut them down but this case yeah no no definitely this case
POD1000000043_S0000290	so on one hand we have a complete rejection by the supreme court that comes after 59 other rejections by judges appointed by democratic and republican presidents including trump
POD1000000043_S0000291	on the other we have 17 state attorneys general and 126 republican members of the house of representatives that is more than half the republican caucus
POD1000000043_S0000292	including minority leader kevin mccarthy who wants to be fucking speaker of the house in 2 years all these people publicly supported an attempt to overturn the results of the election publicly supported and lent their names to
POD1000000043_S0000293	what do you guys take away from that tommy
POD1000000043_S0000294	i mean i take away that the republican party is no longer a party it is a cult and the cult leader is about to be out of office but he is still mixing up a big vat of kool aid and he has not loosened his grip on these people at all
POD1000000043_S0000295	i mean it does not matter how irrational the demand is it does not matter that the demands are illegal the maga cult does not believe in democracy they believe in trump
POD1000000043_S0000296	and i just people love to both sides it and decry partisanship like we should just be clear this is a very new thing like the democratic party was supportive of obama
POD1000000043_S0000297	but if he had said falsely that the bp oil spill was fixed when everyone was watching oil gushing out of it on live tv 0 democrats would have fallen in line behind him right
POD1000000043_S0000298	but like trump is covid denial is worse than that this electoral fiction he is peddling is worse than that and so it is a very scary thing
POD1000000043_S0000299	i would like to believe that it will be destructive for the republican party and that maybe democrats can win but the odds are that 2022 is going to be brutal because of redistricting and so we should not count on it
POD1000000043_S0000300	and i do not know the way around it like i hope that people will get tired of a shtick but that was my hope in 2015 and then 16 and then you know the republican primary happened and obviously that did not happen
POD1000000043_S0000301	i hate to say it guys like well one obvious thing that would be helpful is winning these georgia runoffs but then i hate to say it but it would it would also help i think if brian kemp survived his primary challenge
POD1000000043_S0000302	that is going to come i mean like we need some anti trump republicans to start winning so that they are all not living in fear of a primary challenge from a trump backed candidate otherwise the guy is just going to hold a grip on the party
POD1000000043_S0000303	i grew up on fox news i grew up on newsmax and we are stuck in this cycle i think we have to beat them all i mean i do not i just like there is no i look i know how hard the house is going to be in 2022 i do not know if everyone realizes this but it is going to it was going to be hard no matter what now with redistricting it is going to be even harder
POD1000000043_S0000304	but like i do not see an option besides winning the house or holding the house in 2022
POD1000000043_S0000305	because if like you know i have been saying that a lot of the concern over donald trump successfully overturned this election is is a little overhyped
POD1000000043_S0000306	because we have democrats in all the right positions because we control the house of representatives because we control the governorships in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania like that is the only reason that i felt safe
POD1000000043_S0000307	in saying that joe biden is going to be president if we have a republican house in 2024 not only do i think they will have impeached joe biden by then they will just make up some reason to do that
POD1000000043_S0000308	but then in the 2024 election if the republican candidate or if it is trump pulls what trump pulled again it goes to congress and now you have a republican house
POD1000000043_S0000309	and do we really think the republican house is going to play by the rules after what happened this time i do not think so
POD1000000043_S0000310	yeah i think we should not confuse the fact that this coup will fail and that its instigators are silly and buffoonish from how dangerous this moment is i do not think i think that that is sort of trivial i think we all get that
POD1000000043_S0000311	but then i do think then there is this problem it is like ok well what do we do well we know what we need to do we need to win elections and the problem is we just ran a national election
POD1000000043_S0000312	in which we won we won by 4.5% of the vote but given where our voters are given some of the inherent anti democratic aspects of the senate
POD1000000043_S0000313	it was not enough to win the senate and we still managed to lose some house seats and those fundamental problems are not going anywhere we are not abolishing the electoral college
POD1000000043_S0000314	in the next 4 years we are not getting rid of the senate we are going to have some really bad redistricting that is going to hurt us because we did so poorly in legislatures
POD1000000043_S0000315	and so to me like i do think we have to split these things into kind of 2 big difficult conversations one is how do we win inside of democracy and the other is how do we preserve democracy and fight for it against a party that has abandoned
POD1000000043_S0000316	i no longer am interested in stories about how republicans behind the scenes say they do not really mean it no you do mean it this is it you are not in private saying that you do not support what you support
POD1000000043_S0000317	but actually in private you are pretending to hold a set of beliefs that nothing in your politics nothing in your public statements is true you are pretending to not believe it while everything you do subverts democracy
POD1000000043_S0000318	ted cruz is not putting on a show ted cruz is doing what he thinks is in his best interest he is not doing it he is not going above and beyond he is not saying he wants to argue before the supreme court because he is afraid of trump he is chosen a side he is seen where his people are going so that he can lead them
POD1000000043_S0000319	what they learned from trump is that shame is not a useful attribute to have in politics so they are all shameless you cannot shame these people all we do is 0 these republicans got to learn better we are just going to put pressure on them
POD1000000043_S0000320	we are not putting any pressure on them they do not pressure is not going to change their behavior shame is not going to change their behavior anymore they have to be beaten that is like i know we you know we we did win this time and he tried to steal it but it was enough
POD1000000043_S0000321	it was a big enough margin that he was not able to steal it and the only thing we can do in the future is to beat these people and like you said we are not going to eliminate the electoral college before then before we beat them we are not going to fix gerrymandering before we beat them
POD1000000043_S0000322	we are not going to fix the senate before we beat them all roads lead back to beating them in elections there is nothing else
POD1000000043_S0000323	yeah and i would say to like the next the conversation we should have is obviously not about shame but i do think we should be talking i do think it is a much longer term challenge than even what we will have to do electorally to keep the house and to keep the white house
POD1000000043_S0000324	and it is like all right they are shameless they are mercenaries they are doing what they think is in their interest we need to talk about the fact that they do not view defending democracy as in their interest right that that propaganda has so thoroughly taken hold right
POD1000000043_S0000325	like when you say like they do not respond to shame like what does that mean it means that like virtue integrity these qualities no longer matter in our politics being honest caring about the basic civic ideas that are the bedrock of our country they are not important anymore
POD1000000043_S0000326	which tells us something which is like like it or not yeah our institutions may have been just strong enough to get us through this
POD1000000043_S0000327	right but like this fascistic way of thinking like it is taken hold of a lot of people it is taken hold of a lot of people in this country and it is really really dangerous and we have to talk about those incentives and those levers because this will get worse unless we start looking upriver
POD1000000043_S0000328	when we start looking at propaganda what facebook is doing what fox news is doing and actually having conversations about how we combat it how we do not just lament it but we actually combat it

POD1000000043_S0000387	so there is one more play they are going to try here lost all their legal challenges could not pressure any republican election officials to illegally refuse certification of the results could not find any republican state legislatures to illegally send their own slate of electors
POD1000000043_S0000388	so now they are looking at january 6th which is when the electoral votes are officially tallied in congress and read aloud by none other than the vice president mike pence so that is fun
POD1000000043_S0000389	here is the rules if a member of the house and a senator together both raise an objection to a slate of electors both houses of congress have to vote on whether to reject or accept the objection
POD1000000043_S0000390	of course already a few house republicans no surprise there they are all fucking yahoos and a few senators like ron johnson of wisconsin have said they may object
POD1000000043_S0000391	like it is not going to work because democrats have a majority in the house and will vote down the objection and there are now enough senators in the senate who have said that joe biden is president enough republican senators
POD1000000043_S0000392	that there is also a pro democracy majority in the senate so it is not going to work but it is interesting to me that it is now going to put every single republican member of the house and the senate on record
POD1000000043_S0000393	as whether you were for or against the coup attempt and so the ones who are trying to hide like marco rubio by just doing the hand wave thing they would be like forget about the coup it is the left wing outrage that is a problem
POD1000000043_S0000394	a left wing outrage about the coup that is the real problem
POD1000000043_S0000396	i am not taking this beyond twitter i have said what i have to say on twitter i am not going to bring it to our podcast did not a couple democrats object to bush v gore and they could not find a democratic senator to do it and it kind of went by the wayside
POD1000000043_S0000397	yeah in 2004 they did it with carrie in ohio too but like this is madness
POD1000000043_S0000398	and it will go nowhere it will go nowhere and this time they will have a senator but it will still go nowhere
POD1000000043_S0000399	this is drink the kool aid this is their moment all of them will be on record 0 should we call it the coup
POD1000000043_S0000400	lid with the p that works
POD1000000043_S0000402	thanks guys i do not know if it is a good or a bad thing to have all these guys on the record
POD1000000043_S0000403	as for against the coup attempt i would like to think it is a good thing i do not know maybe we could hold it against them in elections i do not know anymore i do not know anymore it is not like
POD1000000043_S0000404	i think it is going to be sad i think we are going to be sad i think it is going to be a sad moment
POD1000000043_S0000405	every trump thing starts as like zany but then he just goes all in on every maddening insane right wing conspiracy theory that he latches onto and here we are i do not know
POD1000000043_S0000406	it is like when you say something ironically and then all of a sudden it is just something you say yes you know what i mean
POD1000000043_S0000407	all of a sudden you are typing lol
POD1000000043_S0000409	i think it is going to be a really sad moment because like one of the institutions that have stood up really well during the coup attempt is the judiciary and we have seen you know liberal judges conservative judges trump judges all throw out these challenges
POD1000000043_S0000410	but at the end of the day selecting a president comes down to congress and you are right we are going to get a bunch of republican house members who object who cares about them they may get ron johnson or ted cruz or rand paul or
POD1000000043_S0000411	one of the buck nuts in the senate to join them and then both houses are going to have to vote which means that in the future if they do this it is not going to matter what the courts do
POD1000000043_S0000412	if the courts throw them out because it will ultimately come down to the january 6th moment in congress and what if you have a majority in congress one of these days that says yeah we are going to throw out some we are going to throw out some electors and overturn the results that is all it takes that is all it takes is just congress doing that
POD1000000043_S0000413	bit by bit
POD1000000043_S0000415	let us talk about the damage that the coup attempt is already doing beyond our republican politicians the texas republican party responded to the supreme court decision by calling for secession
POD1000000043_S0000416	that is true that actually happened alex jones said that joe biden quote will be removed one way or another
POD1000000043_S0000417	sidney powell a former member of trump is legal team joined other maga lunatics in calling on the president to suspend the electoral college and set up military tribunals
POD1000000043_S0000418	many of these lunatics descended on washington over the weekend where right wing power military groups like the proud boys attacked police counter protesters and defaced 2 historic black churches 4 people were stabbed and 23 arrested like where do we go from here
POD1000000043_S0000419	i think these these are fascists these people are fascists and these are their brown shirts and they are storming around through washington and it is incredibly scary and unsettling and where we go from here feels uncertain to me
POD1000000043_S0000420	i hope we can get through inauguration and like joe biden will be in office and maybe these people can recede to the back but i do think it is going to it is going to take a conscious choice for all of us the media politicians to stop covering donald trump
POD1000000043_S0000421	like he is the national narrator of all us events we cannot center this man in our politics for 4 more years
POD1000000043_S0000422	and rid ourselves of the cancer of this maga fascist mindset we have to try to move on from him somehow we have to get serious and actually focus on things that matter
POD1000000043_S0000423	or otherwise we are going to be back here in 4 years and he is going to be the gop nominee and god knows what will happen
POD1000000043_S0000425	it was such a split screen moment for me over the weekend and just prepping for today is pod is on one hand you have the vaccine development and distribution and it is this it is this example of the entire world working together scientists healthcare workers
POD1000000043_S0000426	truckers politicians everyone coming together to do something good and try to get people vaccinated and then you have these fucking assholes descending on washington just trying to burn everything down just trying to burn it all down
POD1000000043_S0000427	like these people are awful just awful
POD1000000043_S0000428	yeah and i do think we need to stop trying to convince ourselves that because they are silly because they write things on their butts because sidney powell is a bad lawyer because rudy giuliani is face melted
POD1000000043_S0000429	like we need to stop taking comfort in the fact that they are silly because like every dangerous violent revanchist anti democratic movement is silly in some sense
POD1000000043_S0000430	if they were not dumb if they were not buffoonish they would not support that movement and so like we should just keep in mind that some of the most dangerous and reactionary forces that have had huge impact on this country
POD1000000043_S0000431	that have pulled this country backwards in our history were geniuses they did not have to be because when you employ violence when you introduce the specter of violence across our politics it
POD1000000043_S0000432	can work things and change things without you having to be very sophisticated and i just think that requires i do not know what to do with that information i do not it is but it is just something we all should keep in mind
POD1000000043_S0000433	and like do not take comfort in their stupidity we just can not
POD1000000043_S0000435	yeah it is it is still an open question of how big their numbers are and part of this is making sure the numbers do not get bigger you are not going to do anything about the assholes who descended on d c but there is other people who could fall into that kind of trap
POD1000000043_S0000436	and you want to avoid that i mean like there was a new cbs poll out over the weekend you know and it gives the usual numbers only 18% of trump voters think biden is the legitimate winner of the election 49% think trump should refuse to concede even if the electoral college votes for biden which they will
POD1000000043_S0000437	and 75% think republicans in congress should try to keep trump in power but then i saw at the end the last question was 40% of trump voters believe that if biden is the president
POD1000000043_S0000438	that trump and his supporters should work together with biden on making progress which was surprising because i am like these same people who think the election is not legitimate you know 60% of them think never work with biden on anything so that is still a majority
POD1000000043_S0000439	but that 40% might be where you begin you know like because it is the only option we have at this point
POD1000000043_S0000440	well i also just think it is interesting too it is important too because what it does also show you is that these are in some sense performative reactions even to pollsters we are all pundits now we are all on a team
POD1000000043_S0000441	and that is a good thing in the sense that people are saying things they do not totally mean it is a dangerous thing in which beliefs themselves are now how you demonstrate you are filthy which means nobody is going to be telling the truth
POD1000000043_S0000442	and you know like sorry i am going to do it vonnegut the quote which i think about all the time these days is you know you are what you pretend to be so be careful what you pretend to be it does not matter
POD1000000043_S0000443	the difference between what people say and what they think is it does not really matter because what people say and what they perform is what becomes our politics
POD1000000043_S0000444	i am going to follow suit here so i was reading obama is book and then i started reading like an old book i had from college from vaclav havel who was a playwright writer thinker political leader in the czech republic
POD1000000043_S0000445	and he talks about sort of how every country every culture every society has these sort of polls right there is always sort of a fascistic camp and there is always a more hopeful camp and it is up to the leaders to decide which one of those you awaken
POD1000000043_S0000446	and trump has spent 4 to 6 years awakening the scary fascistic right wing camp and the next republican like ronald reagan was awful he did immeasurable damage to this country
POD1000000043_S0000447	but he did not do that and we barely survived that and the next set of republican leaders better be pretty goddamn careful
POD1000000043_S0000448	about whether or not they decide to reawaken those fascistic forces because right now those people were there in d c over the weekend saying chanting destroy the gop because they will not go along with a coup attempt so yeah that shit will bite you back
POD1000000043_S0000449	well and you know you talk about future republican presidents but it is also this is this was part of joe biden is message in the campaign talking about what you want to project to the country and what kind of country that you want to have you know like
POD1000000043_S0000450	and do i have a lot of optimism that joe biden and mitch mcconnell are going to sit down and hammer out some deals together no i do not but i think biden is message was bigger than i am going to work with republicans in congress it is about you know a battle for the soul of the country and healing the nation
POD1000000043_S0000451	and i think projecting that image to the country it matters
POD1000000043_S0000453	and 0 by the way let us add to the list as he projects that vision to the country he also perhaps without a senate hopefully with a senate that is incredibly divided regardless
POD1000000043_S0000454	he has to deliver and that is like the single most important thing he can do to save the country from this which is deliver
POD1000000043_S0000455	100%
POD1000000043_S0000456	well that is all we have for today and everyone check out pod save the world for the big obama interview this week and we will talk to you guys on thursday

POD1000000044_S0000039	the session was recorded as a part of an educational psychotherapy video series in the session alvin is helping ted relive a memory the time as domineering father in law was rude to his wife
POD1000000044_S0000040	yeah and he is all dressed up

POD1000000044_S0000049	yeah
POD1000000044_S0000050	alvin does voices and role plays and at times the session feels like avant garde improv
POD1000000044_S0000051	that son of a
POD1000000044_S0000052	it is playful and honestly kind of bizarre but the point of it all is to help the patient rehearse behavior in the office that he can then apply in real life
POD1000000044_S0000053	touch her touch her
POD1000000044_S0000054	0 gee
POD1000000044_S0000056	yeah holder
POD1000000044_S0000058	thank you so much
POD1000000044_S0000059	by the end of the session alvin has turned ted a meek buttoned up patient into someone capable of expressing himself emotionally
POD1000000044_S0000060	going to be this way with jenny because you rehearsed it
POD1000000044_S0000061	we got it huh
POD1000000044_S0000062	i am ready
POD1000000044_S0000064	we have this ability within us to become a whole new person
POD1000000044_S0000066	alvin died in 2014 but this is howard a psychotherapist and one of alvin is disciples howard runs alvin is website and publishes his books
POD1000000044_S0000067	are you talking a little hyperbolically when you say a whole new person
POD1000000044_S0000068	no it is that radical jonathan it is to become a whole new person the term he used is an optimal person and to discover that within yourself
POD1000000044_S0000070	according to alvin once you have discovered this optimal personhood you can shake off what others want and live on your own terms
POD1000000044_S0000071	it changed my life direction
POD1000000044_S0000072	and for these kinds of radical results alvin was given a lifetime achievement award from the american psychological association
POD1000000044_S0000073	one psychology textbook even goes so far as to describe alvin as being quote as important as freud
POD1000000044_S0000075	but this is not a story about alvin is professional life his life inside the office this is a story about alvin is real life
POD1000000044_S0000076	he insisted i run away
POD1000000044_S0000077	this is rachel alvin is daughter
POD1000000044_S0000078	and i did
POD1000000044_S0000079	how old were you
POD1000000044_S0000080	i was in grade 5
POD1000000044_S0000081	the year was 1970 alvin and rachel is mom had been locked in an ugly custody battle for 8 years
POD1000000044_S0000082	rachel is mom was poor and struggled with depression rachel really wanted to live with her dad so when alvin suggested she run away from judy in denver to his house in ohio rachel did not pack a bag she did not say goodbye to anyone
POD1000000044_S0000083	she just laughed
POD1000000044_S0000084	like he set up this whole thing with his lawyer and i just felt like i needed to do what my dad and the lawyer told me and this was the right thing i think i said i was going to the library and
POD1000000044_S0000085	but somehow i do not remember how i got to the lawyer is office and then they took me to the airport and put me on the plane and i left
POD1000000044_S0000087	alvin had gotten remarried to a woman with 2 kids and rachel loved feeling like she was a part of this happy family there were dogs to play with and bikes to ride and yet this other feeling would often creep in
POD1000000044_S0000088	i miss my mom i miss my friends i miss my cat but i could never ever ever say that out loud to anybody
POD1000000044_S0000089	and there was someone else rachel missed missed most of all
POD1000000044_S0000091	she told us she was going to the library and then she never came back
POD1000000044_S0000092	this is rachel is brother john he is 2.5 years younger than rachel and only has flashes of early childhood memory about alvin
POD1000000044_S0000093	he recalls doing father son things that would make perfect sense if the son was an adult things like lifting weights together and smoking
POD1000000044_S0000094	he was a pipe smoker he bought me my own little cherry wood pipe and you know as a 4 year old he actually had me smoking you know tobacco in the pipe with him
POD1000000044_S0000095	it was as though alvin could not distinguish between adults and children which was why he saw john is closeness with his mom not as a child is natural maternal attachment but rather as a personal slight
POD1000000044_S0000096	and so alvin never asked john to run away john was left behind in denver with judy
POD1000000044_S0000097	i think in his mind i just you know was more a mama is boy and a chip off judy is block and i think he sort of gave up on me and he was really focused on rachel
POD1000000044_S0000098	and as the final custody hearing approached alvin is focus on rachel intensified he wanted to prove to the court that rachel was better off with him so he had about a half dozen social workers and psychologists offer assessments
POD1000000044_S0000099	rachel was interviewed and alvin is new family observed none of the experts spoke to judy and the plan worked
POD1000000044_S0000100	in the autumn of 1970 a judge ruled that rachel would be allowed to stay in ohio with al for good but john would remain in denver with judy
POD1000000044_S0000101	and we never lived together again
POD1000000044_S0000103	when you have a sibling who is just a critical part of your family and then you are separated from them it is a wound
POD1000000044_S0000104	how uncommon was an arrangement like that
POD1000000044_S0000105	extreme yeah very very uncommon kids are not split up
POD1000000044_S0000106	we each grew up alone i missed her through my whole childhood i missed her a lot
POD1000000044_S0000107	i mean we were so close when we were young and you know she was the big sister who through all of that was looking out for me
POD1000000044_S0000109	growing up from then on just me and my mom grew up as an only child and my mom just always being in pain and
POD1000000044_S0000110	she never was able to enjoy whatever it is we were doing at the moment it was always 0 if only rachel were here we could all be together and i would be saying but we are here now
POD1000000044_S0000112	when he turned 13 john invited rachel to his bar mitzvah but alvin would not let her go rachel sent a poem instead
POD1000000044_S0000113	it had to do with a rubber band stretching across the distance and connecting us
POD1000000044_S0000115	for john not only did he lose his big sister he also lost his dad year after year john tried to re enter alvin is life but each time he reached out alvin rebuked him
POD1000000044_S0000116	one time as an adolescent john tried scheduling a visit
POD1000000044_S0000117	and he said well as long as you guys you know me and my mom required any money any child support there would be no visit
POD1000000044_S0000118	and i said well it sounds like you care more about money than about me and he said well i do not want it to just sound like that that is how it is
POD1000000044_S0000120	nevertheless a few years later john asked once again if he could come visit by this point rachel was 18 and no longer living with alvin
POD1000000044_S0000121	so when alvin refused john yet again rachel told her brother to come visit her instead they had not seen each other in 8 years was she the same sister that you remembered
POD1000000044_S0000122	no i mean i knew her as a you know
POD1000000044_S0000124	678910 year old next time i saw her she was an adult
POD1000000044_S0000126	in the years since that visit rachel and john have made a point of staying in each other is lives they talk on the phone celebrate holidays together and once a year their families all take a trip but their childhood together that has been lost
POD1000000044_S0000127	i mean my daughter certainly watches us and thinks that we are more like cousins she can see the disconnect because we did not grow up together
POD1000000044_S0000128	john and rachel still have questions about their childhood but now that their parents are both dead they have no one to ask so they parse through their separate memories trying to construct a timeline comparing moments of overlap and filling in the blanks
POD1000000044_S0000129	to this end one night while john was visiting rachel for thanksgiving he asked if they could go through alvin is files
POD1000000044_S0000131	alvin was an obsessive record keeper and after he died rachel inherited his papers she would never really gone through them keeping them stored away in a filing cabinet but that night she pulled them out
POD1000000044_S0000132	and together john and rachel made a series of disturbing discoveries the 1st of which was the script
POD1000000044_S0000134	the script for me was like 0 my god
POD1000000044_S0000136	the script was a lengthy diatribe written by alvin from the point of view of a child rachel is point of view
POD1000000044_S0000137	in it alvin refers to himself as daddy judy as mother or judy or simply she i later ask rachel to read some over the phone
POD1000000044_S0000139	2.5 pages long and small psychologist rating okay so here i go it is in my good happy dreams custody is changed and i live with daddy
POD1000000044_S0000140	if i am forced to go back and live with mother it will only be till the day i am 14 which apparently was when you could decide
POD1000000044_S0000141	when i am with her i feel scared that i might get tight and angry and cold like judy she is not a mother she is a keeper she makes me feel like i am in a prison i can not let her touch me
POD1000000044_S0000142	it was like finding your childhood internal monolog committed to paper and written in your father is handwriting rachel did not remember seeing the script as a kid but she remembered saying those things and she remembered thinking them
POD1000000044_S0000143	in one of alvin is many books a volume entitled the manual of optimal behavior he writes that behavior can be rehearsed and modified quote until you are ready and eager to go ahead and do what you have rehearsed and modified
POD1000000044_S0000144	unbeknownst to her alvin was having rachel rehearse and modify
POD1000000044_S0000145	it was so .
POD1000000044_S0000147	explicit there was nothing subtle about it you know the whole thing was sick
POD1000000044_S0000149	the 2nd thing discovered among the files was a letter from rachel to her mom in it she begs judy to let her live with alvin but there were 2 copies one written in rachel is hand and one written in alvin is
POD1000000044_S0000151	going through the papers rachel remembered other things how alvin encouraged her not to smile when she was with her mom saying if someone photographed her happy it could be used as evidence against him in court
POD1000000044_S0000152	in every photo from that period with her mother rachel is wearing a frown
POD1000000044_S0000153	that is when i started questioning and started to realize that i was coached or brainwashed
POD1000000044_S0000155	it made sense for most of her adult life rachel had had no memory of loving her mom it was only after her mother is death when she found mother is day and birthday cards she would written to judy when she was very small
POD1000000044_S0000156	that rachel realized she had i love you mommy she would written i love you so much but with al is constant coaching it had all been stamped out
POD1000000044_S0000158	the final thing john and rachel found that night were those psychological reports alvin had rachel submit to just before the final custody hearing in them you see alvin is scripting bear out
POD1000000044_S0000159	one report notes that rachel kept repeating quote i want to live with my father he loves me my mother does not love me the report notes that she said this with quote grim determination
POD1000000044_S0000161	they also uncovered one particular report that night that was longer than any of the others it was the only one that evaluated both john and rachel and in this it carried the most weight
POD1000000044_S0000163	and what shocked john and rachel most of all
POD1000000044_S0000164	my dad clearly edited it and then she rewrote it with the edits and submitted that rewrite
POD1000000044_S0000165	is that ethical as a social worker
POD1000000044_S0000166	no it is not no 0 no no no no one should ever let anybody else especially their client edit their reports no it is really bad
POD1000000044_S0000167	the report was written by a social worker named joyce
POD1000000044_S0000169	alvin is edits to joyce is report made the language more emphatic for example where joyce had written that rachel was hesitant when it came to judy alvin changed it to say she was fearful in another spot
POD1000000044_S0000170	he added that rachel wanted to blot out any memory of ever having been away from him
POD1000000044_S0000171	honestly i mean it was horrifying you know just to see the detailed notes to see the edited drafts the cross outs and his handwriting
POD1000000044_S0000172	and then the final version that was submitted to the courts with his edits in there like there is no question what happened
POD1000000044_S0000174	the report concludes with a recommendation the strongest one of any report and the only recommendation of its kind
POD1000000044_S0000175	she recommended that i live with him and that my brother live with my mom
POD1000000044_S0000176	john and rachel is separation came down to a decision dictated by alvin and signed off on by joyce
POD1000000044_S0000178	how was alvin able to exert this kind of power over a social worker someone who is supposed to be an impartial outsider john and rachel could not understand it
POD1000000044_S0000179	but that night when rachel googled joyce she was shocked to realize that joyce had not been an impartial outsider at all joyce was a family friend
POD1000000044_S0000181	rachel recognized joyce as the kind dark haired woman whose house she visited as a child
POD1000000044_S0000182	rachel would bring her cello over to play music with joyce and her family which means that on top of everything else wrong with the report joyce should never have been the person to write it in the 1st place
POD1000000044_S0000183	she was like the one person in my life as a kid who could have said hey i think you are coaching her and this is not right
POD1000000044_S0000184	why are we going to try and split these kids up she was the one who could have said something
POD1000000044_S0000185	in 1970 joyce recommended that my sister go with my father and that i go with my mother and that is what happened
POD1000000044_S0000187	and that dictated the course of my life what happened
POD1000000044_S0000189	this is the question that has been nagging at john and rachel since they found the report how could this have happened and so john and rachel want to find joyce and ask her
POD1000000044_S0000190	what i do not fully understand though is what i have to offer rachel and john are both practicing therapists themselves they are more than capable of posing difficult questions
POD1000000044_S0000191	and although i play a mental health semi professional semi convincingly on a podcast i am not actually one at all what can i do
POD1000000044_S0000192	well so i have had to advocate for myself my entire life from a very young age and nobody advocated for me or my brother
POD1000000044_S0000193	and so if you could help me with this it would be a healing piece for me that somebody else advocated for me
POD1000000044_S0000195	after the break in search of joyce

POD1000000044_S0000241	bob is a regular renaissance man in that he also worked at a renaissance fair when bob showed up to film that day he was asked to improvise some sort of marital problem that alvin could help solve by bringing his method to bear
POD1000000044_S0000242	i asked bob if he found alvin is behavior domineering but bob does not recall much there is one thing though that bob does still recall even 13 years later it seems bob was not alvin is 1st choice of patient
POD1000000044_S0000243	he had had someone else do it before i think it was an african american lady and it did not go the way it needed to do you know what i mean
POD1000000044_S0000244	can you elaborate
POD1000000044_S0000245	he showed it to me briefly
POD1000000044_S0000246	bob describes the video alvin showed him before they started filming that day in it the setup was the same as it was for bob is shoot alvin was in an armchair his legs up on an ottoman except this time .
POD1000000044_S0000247	in the armchair beside him was the actress like bob the actress in the video had been asked to come up with a marriage problem but in doing so the actress went to a darker place than alvin anticipated describing a husband who was vicious and cruel
POD1000000044_S0000248	nonetheless alvin tried to offer counsel
POD1000000044_S0000249	he was saying things like when he behaves in this way can you be playful about it and the actor said things like when he calls me names suggesting that he might be in some ways borderline at the very least verbally abusive
POD1000000044_S0000250	it seemed there was the way the actress was given to talking about an abusive relationship and then there was the way that alvin preferred her to talk about one and so the actress was replaced and bob was shown her video to illustrate what alvin did not want
POD1000000044_S0000251	it is you know i got the message i guess
POD1000000044_S0000253	still not having received a response from joyce i decide to mail a letter and just a few days later i find an email in my inbox in it joyce tells me she is not sure how much help she can be
POD1000000044_S0000254	she reminds me that it has been 50 years but she says she is willing to try she concludes the email by saying please feel free to contact me if you wish joyce
POD1000000044_S0000256	hello
POD1000000044_S0000257	hello

POD1000000044_S0000261	the last time john and rachel saw joyce they were children
POD1000000044_S0000262	they are now in their 50s and 60s because of the pandemic the meeting between rachel john and joyce will have to take place over zoom john and rachel join 1st from their respective homes
POD1000000044_S0000263	so how are you guys feeling today
POD1000000044_S0000264	quite anxious actually what about you brother john
POD1000000044_S0000265	i am more nervous than i thought i would be
POD1000000044_S0000266	john is seated in a chair his posture upright rachel is sitting back on a couch
POD1000000044_S0000267	go ahead and talk a little bit what did you have for breakfast
POD1000000044_S0000268	i had yogurt and blueberries yeah
POD1000000044_S0000269	me too
POD1000000044_S0000271	i can see the joyce is in the zoom waiting room waiting
POD1000000044_S0000272	back in my day a waiting room had all kinds of stuff to keep you occupied like lukewarm water you could drink from a paper cup or a 20 year old copy of vogue but now waiting rooms are so metaphysical there is nothing to do in them
POD1000000044_S0000273	i suggest we let joyce in
POD1000000044_S0000274	okay
POD1000000044_S0000275	yeah okay yeah let us do it
POD1000000044_S0000276	joyce appears on the screen wearing a bright blue sweater and a colorful ascot that gives her the affect of a fun grandmother standing beside joyce is a middle aged man who i assume is her son he is helping her get set up
POD1000000044_S0000277	hello
POD1000000044_S0000278	0 hello
POD1000000044_S0000280	joyce and her son frown at the computer it seems they are having sound issues there is a long moment in which we all look at each other in silence and then .
POD1000000044_S0000282	joyce settles into an armchair
POD1000000044_S0000283	well do you all look familiar to each other
POD1000000044_S0000284	no well it has been a long time i am rachel hi joyce
POD1000000044_S0000285	hi rachel
POD1000000044_S0000286	hi i am john
POD1000000044_S0000287	you are john
POD1000000044_S0000288	so joyce do you i know john and rachel are curious about just how much you remember maybe
POD1000000044_S0000289	virtually nothing
POD1000000044_S0000291	so i was not clear what i can do for you i am certainly willing to try
POD1000000044_S0000293	so i think what we are remembering from that time or what we know is that my dad and my mom were in a very i do not know if you remember bitter custody battle
POD1000000044_S0000294	and there were so many court battles
POD1000000044_S0000295	and one of the reports was done by you so we wanted to talk to you about that and find out what you remembered about that
POD1000000044_S0000297	joyce inhales through clenched teeth shakes her head
POD1000000044_S0000298	i really do not know what happened
POD1000000044_S0000300	we want to we think our father influenced kind of everybody he met in a very heavy handed way
POD1000000044_S0000301	yes i would certainly agree with that
POD1000000044_S0000303	saying al was heavy handed is an understatement
POD1000000044_S0000305	joyce is husband at the time was a colleague of alvin is that is how she 1st came to know alvin he and her husband both taught in the local university is psychology department joyce says her husband would always come home with al stories
POD1000000044_S0000306	acting out at meetings and shouting out inappropriate stuff so he was very controlling he took control of any social situation
POD1000000044_S0000307	one party at my house he was a guest along with the other members of the psych department and he just took control of the whole evening
POD1000000044_S0000308	and of course the more people drank the more intense it got i think the focus was on people is dreams and dream analysis
POD1000000044_S0000309	for alvin a freudian this meant exploring each partygoer is dream for hidden sexual desires that he alvin could then expound upon in a room full of colleagues
POD1000000044_S0000311	joyce relates the anecdote to illustrate the kind of guy alvin was but john hears something else in the story
POD1000000044_S0000312	so you are socialized
POD1000000044_S0000314	john is trying to remind joyce that she was alvin is friend that writing the report was not appropriate but the implication goes over joyce is head
POD1000000044_S0000315	the department was not a big one and it was close knit and everybody got together
POD1000000044_S0000316	you know him
POD1000000044_S0000317	friday what do you do you hang out with the people that you know best and that was in the department
POD1000000044_S0000319	what kinds of questions did you have that i can help with or that i might answer or speculate about
POD1000000044_S0000321	you do not remember evaluating us you do not remember having that role
POD1000000044_S0000322	no
POD1000000044_S0000323	i guess i am curious if you remember because i would have said also like i want to live with my dad and i love living here but i was coached
POD1000000044_S0000324	like do not smile if someone takes a picture of you with your mother
POD1000000044_S0000325	0 rachel 0 rachel
POD1000000044_S0000326	could you see that at all
POD1000000044_S0000327	no i i this is all news to me
POD1000000044_S0000329	did you do other custody evaluations was that a part of your practice
POD1000000044_S0000330	that may have been one of the 1st ones and it was at his request that i did that initially
POD1000000044_S0000331	it was at al is request you are saying
POD1000000044_S0000332	0 yeah yeah
POD1000000044_S0000334	do you remember any thoughts or feelings that
POD1000000044_S0000336	you know maybe it is not appropriate for me to evaluate someone that i socialize
POD1000000044_S0000337	no no not really because this was in the beginning of our arrival and so we were not really socializing at that point
POD1000000044_S0000339	at that point joyce and her husband had just arrived in town while her husband taught at the university joyce did not she hoped to someday but she was still fairly young
POD1000000044_S0000340	and at the time the only women in the psych department were grad students and secretaries so when alvin this larger than life figure came asking for a favor it felt hard to say no
POD1000000044_S0000341	he was chair of that program
POD1000000044_S0000343	and you know i was new in town i am a people pleaser
POD1000000044_S0000345	so i think that that added to my vulnerability to al
POD1000000044_S0000347	well i want to make sure that you know that
POD1000000044_S0000349	your report recommends that we are split up
POD1000000044_S0000351	joyce takes off her glasses she places them in her lap
POD1000000044_S0000352	0 wow
POD1000000044_S0000354	i am sorry
POD1000000044_S0000356	i never
POD1000000044_S0000358	would have done something like that
POD1000000044_S0000360	and hearing that i did makes me feel terrible
POD1000000044_S0000362	so that is a surprise to you
POD1000000044_S0000363	it is total surprise and it is totally
POD1000000044_S0000365	against everything i believe
POD1000000044_S0000367	it is horrifying i do not know what prompted it or what precipitated it
POD1000000044_S0000369	i do not know
POD1000000044_S0000371	i am sorry
POD1000000044_S0000373	but of course there is more
POD1000000044_S0000374	we can see al crossing out words and phrases
POD1000000044_S0000376	that you wrote and then rewriting them in stronger language
POD1000000044_S0000378	and then it is that stronger language that is in the final report
POD1000000044_S0000380	i am appalled by that
POD1000000044_S0000382	i hate to keep repeating myself but i am truly sorry that that happened and had terrible consequences
POD1000000044_S0000384	i have a stomachache i feel terrible that it turned out that way i feel awful that i had a part in that
POD1000000044_S0000386	or that i am perceived to have had it well i did i mean i can not say i did not if i wrote it
POD1000000044_S0000388	this is something joyce does a few times she will start to say something like if i did this but then she will correct herself rachel has the report standing by to hold to the camera so joyce can see it for herself see her own signature
POD1000000044_S0000389	but that never becomes necessary even though she does not remember joyce believes john and rachel and so she does not cop out or equivocate
POD1000000044_S0000391	if i did something like that or because i did something like that
POD1000000044_S0000393	i am so sorry you guys if there is anything i can do to mitigate in some small way
POD1000000044_S0000395	and it means a lot that you say that
POD1000000044_S0000396	0 yeah yeah
POD1000000044_S0000397	and it is not just words it is heartfelt it is really heartfelt
POD1000000044_S0000399	do you have any idea why he might have turned to you
POD1000000044_S0000400	well to control the outcome i think
POD1000000044_S0000402	
POD1000000044_S0000404	he was more comfortable with women because he could push them around
POD1000000044_S0000406	did you feel used
POD1000000044_S0000408	by him
POD1000000044_S0000410	well i guess he was using me so yeah
POD1000000044_S0000412	joyce says the relationship with alvin was short lived the end came soon after joyce invited alvin and a few of his psychologist friends to join her private practice they accepted and all began working out of her office
POD1000000044_S0000413	and we did that for a while and then they decided that it was not appropriate to have a social worker in the practice so they asked me to leave
POD1000000044_S0000414	and it was at al is instigation
POD1000000044_S0000416	what he said to me was it is not that you are incompetent
POD1000000044_S0000417	it is just that i do not know that you are competent
POD1000000044_S0000419	and you know for me to remember this 50 years later says a lot does not it
POD1000000044_S0000421	so this is him kicking you out of the practice
POD1000000044_S0000422	my
POD1000000044_S0000424	my practice
POD1000000044_S0000425	your practice
POD1000000044_S0000427	i remember you like very very very fondly
POD1000000044_S0000428	well you are kind
POD1000000044_S0000429	you are a nice lady you are a good person and i see that now too i mean i had every reason to feel that way
POD1000000044_S0000431	rachel will later tell me that because of the way her dad brainwashed her she often can not trust her memories so it feels good that her memory of joyce is correct joyce is nice but rachel is nice too and can sense how badly joyce is feeling
POD1000000044_S0000432	you know i think my dad was so controlling
POD1000000044_S0000433	and i have to think that my dad coerced you and really pressured you to do that
POD1000000044_S0000435	thank you
POD1000000044_S0000437	you know hopefully you can tell rachel and i are okay
POD1000000044_S0000438	we are really good parents we are close to our children we did not replicate any of this
POD1000000044_S0000439	0 that is wonderful i am so glad to hear that
POD1000000044_S0000440	and i have been with my wife 37 years and thankfully now you know rachel and i came back together on our own and i am very close with my sister
POD1000000044_S0000441	0 i am so glad i am so glad
POD1000000044_S0000443	damage done to us can often become damage we do to others and on it goes but watching john and rachel i am struck by the way they are breaking that cycle not just in their lives but right here in the room
POD1000000044_S0000444	well the zoom room
POD1000000044_S0000445	just to be clear joyce i really appreciate what you are saying
POD1000000044_S0000446	really really important to me that others just own and acknowledge their role in any dynamic
POD1000000044_S0000447	in any interaction if they do that i am good and i will never
POD1000000044_S0000449	i tried in different ways
POD1000000044_S0000450	he would never own any culpability responsibility anything
POD1000000044_S0000451	when john 1st became a psychologist he would see alvin at various conferences where alvin was received as a star
POD1000000044_S0000452	for john it always occasioned a weird mix of pride in his father is career and bitterness over his personal rejection
POD1000000044_S0000453	at one conference john attended alvin is lecture in the hope of forcing his father to talk to him
POD1000000044_S0000454	alvin saw john in the audience but afterwards made him wait on line along with all his adoring fans eventually john grew frustrated and left
POD1000000044_S0000455	it is one of the mysteries of my life how he justified or rationalized to himself you know having a son and supposedly loving him
POD1000000044_S0000456	and then just cutting him off and rejecting him for the rest of your life i can not fathom that at all
POD1000000044_S0000458	there was an email exchange over 7 or 8 months where i endeavored to answer that question that lifelong question of you know why
POD1000000044_S0000459	and he just kept trying to sell me his books and you know it became this refrain have you read my book have you read my book and i would say if you would like me to read your book
POD1000000044_S0000460	send me a copy and i will read it no he wants me to buy a book he wanted me to buy a book
POD1000000044_S0000462	in his emails to john alvin wrote that it was a sophomoric myth that a parent should seek relationships with one is child i do not accept silly pop psychology truisms he wrote
POD1000000044_S0000463	near the end of alvin is life john wanted to make one last effort to see his father so alvin could meet his grandkids
POD1000000044_S0000464	but rachel counseled john not to go she said that alvin would refuse to see him and was still so full of anger that he might even call the police
POD1000000044_S0000465	after his death alvin left behind a will with a section listing the names of those who would wronged him each person was to receive a single dollar among them was john
POD1000000044_S0000466	back when i spoke to al is disciple howard he told me that al was bedridden at the end of his life yet he was still focused on his therapeutic method
POD1000000044_S0000467	just before he passed away when i visited him he said howard i am working on becoming more of an optimal person i am just doing it now and he was like so energetic
POD1000000044_S0000468	and do you .
POD1000000044_S0000469	from your perspective i mean did he achieve that kind of like optimal personhood
POD1000000044_S0000471	she said he had .
POD1000000044_S0000473	when i raised the subject of alvin is relationship with his kids and how that connected to his optimal self howard says he can not really speak to that alvin did not bring up his kids much
POD1000000044_S0000474	there is a lot of stuff that goes on sometimes good and bad and you know that is just what happens in life we live and we adjust and do what we have to do
POD1000000044_S0000475	but i do not think whatever happens at a certain point in someone is life should define them for who they are as a person overall
POD1000000044_S0000477	can you come back in a little bit honey
POD1000000044_S0000478	a little girl barges into joyce is room she is wearing a lacy blue dress that is either a nightgown or a cinderella costume

POD1000000044_S0000491	yeah thank you
POD1000000044_S0000493	one can believe one is optimal just as one can believe one is fluent in french a talented singer a good therapist but the only way to really know is through one is relationship with others the ones who love us who guide us
POD1000000044_S0000494	who let us know when we wandered astray for some realizing your optimal self does not occur in spite of other people but because of them

POD1000000045_S0000009	because i know if anybody can fill us in especially those of us who maybe have not had the best year of books and reading can fill us in on some things that we might have missed
POD1000000045_S0000010	it is you you read so much you know so much about not just the reading side of things but now about the author and publishing side of things so i was getting so excited i can not wait for our talk today
POD1000000045_S0000011	me too i had so much fun looking through my list of what i would read this year to figure out what i was going to bring

POD1000000045_S0000014	so my husband and i live in north texas and he is working full time he works for the electric company so he never got to stay home he had to go all the time
POD1000000045_S0000015	and i have a 7 year old in 1st grade and a 3 about to be 4 year old and i just decided to homeschool them this year i have an education background i taught 4th grade for 78 years and so
POD1000000045_S0000016	i just decided you know what i can not deal with the anxiety of the schools going back and forth and whatnot so i decided to homeschool so we are trying that out for the 1st time this year which is interesting
POD1000000045_S0000017	other than that i do a lot of reading and i do a lot of writing and we just start kind of going with the flow of life
POD1000000045_S0000018	i am with you on going with the flow all of my kids are it seems like are doing different things
POD1000000045_S0000019	our oldest 2 are still enrolled in their regular school and they are doing all virtual they got to go back on campus
POD1000000045_S0000020	we tried to open schools in oklahoma city they got to go back for 2 days 2 single days
POD1000000045_S0000021	we had to close down again the twins meanwhile who are in 2nd grade i had pulled them out at the beginning of the year because i am like you with the younger kids i just did not want to do the back and forth back and forth
POD1000000045_S0000022	so i also am homeschooling for the 1st time and it is an experience
POD1000000045_S0000024	but i think that you captured it perfectly with just like we got to go with the flow so that is what we are doing
POD1000000045_S0000025	okay well you guys truly katie has picked out some very fun books and i want to tell you before we get to our conversation later in the episode
POD1000000045_S0000026	whether you are a prolific reader and reading is your passion it is your hobby and you have read a lot this year or truly like me you guys the main reason i wanted to have this conversation with katie is because honestly
POD1000000045_S0000027	this is one of my worst years of reading ever i mean i know a lot of us maybe are in that boat
POD1000000045_S0000028	it just has not been something i have been able to carve out time for this year in the midst of you know all of the other craziness
POD1000000045_S0000029	so katie has picked some really cool things and so whether you are a prolific reader or if you are like me and you have been in a little bit of a slump i promise you katie has something on her list that you are going to love so we are going to get to all of that
POD1000000045_S0000030	in just a few minutes but katie let us go ahead and start this show the way we always do with our awesomes of the week
POD1000000045_S0000031	if you are new to sorta awesome awesome of the week is the moment in the show where we like to stop talk about whatever is awesome in life right now whether it is a book or a tv show sometimes it is a movie or a podcast or a product
POD1000000045_S0000032	whatever is bringing a little joy that we need so much right now to our lives katie i can not wait to hear what you brought for your awesome of the week
POD1000000045_S0000033	okay so mine is a beauty product and it is a all bright c serum so it is a vitamin c serum from beauty counter it is the most cutest little yellow bottle that you have ever seen
POD1000000045_S0000034	and the liquid that comes out is actually yellow because it has some turmeric in it and so it has this really like nice earthy kind of smell but it is a vitamin c serum it goes just on after you cleanse and tone
POD1000000045_S0000035	and i swear this makes my face look instantly better like your skin goes from like boring to like bright and pretty in 30 seconds so it is my favorite product of all times right now
POD1000000045_S0000036	i will just testify so we are on zoom so i can see your beautiful face and you definitely do have a lovely glow about you so yeah i am going to testify that this stuff must work
POD1000000045_S0000038	it is great it is my favorite thing so far this year
POD1000000045_S0000039	also i want to tell you guys too that katie like had the bottle and she was showing it to me and now i am like 0 that is a pretty yellow bottle i think i need to check this out
POD1000000045_S0000041	i am sure you are like me i mean i collect all kinds of serums and as it is gotten colder even in the part of the country where you and i live which is not like freezing but it is you know it is cold and dry air for us
POD1000000045_S0000042	i am like where is the moisturizer please i need all the moisturizer right now everything is dry so okay tell us the name of the product one more time
POD1000000045_S0000043	so it is beauty counter all bright sea serum
POD1000000045_S0000044	okay perfect
POD1000000045_S0000045	beauty counter is technically an mlm company but i do not think you have to use a consultant so you can just order straight from their website and i will say it is a little pricey but you do not need much like i have had this bottle for probably 6 months
POD1000000045_S0000046	and i still have a good little bit left so it is just my favorite
POD1000000045_S0000047	i have noticed that with vitamin c serums too a little goes a long way for sure so we will have a link to katie is awesome in the show notes for you guys
POD1000000045_S0000048	okay my awesome of the week is seasonal i had something totally picked out that i was going to talk about i am going to save that for another day because just recently a brand new christmas album dropped because you guys know we do not have enough christmas albums in the world right
POD1000000045_S0000050	but the one that just dropped that i am so excited about is from dolly parton
POD1000000045_S0000051	i love her
POD1000000045_S0000052	yes have you okay 1st of all katie did you listen to because i know you listen to a lot of podcasts too did you listen to dolly parton is america
POD1000000045_S0000053	which is the sort of like standalone series that came out maybe last year i can not remember when it came out
POD1000000045_S0000054	i did not but i just listened to her talk to brene brown
POD1000000045_S0000056	yes i have been hearing so many good things about that interview so i am going to put a link to both jolly partons of america and to that brene brown interview in the show notes for you guys to check out
POD1000000045_S0000057	i think growing up in oklahoma now katie i am a little bit older than you so going back a decade or so growing up in oklahoma in the 80s and the 90s
POD1000000045_S0000058	dolly parton was such a skeptic figure i feel like there is never been a time in my life when i did not know who dolly was
POD1000000045_S0000059	so her music is really you know it is part of my childhood it is part of my growing up years dolly parton is america is a fantastic podcast that i thought i loved dolly before i listened to that
POD1000000045_S0000060	0 my gosh it unlocks like who this woman is how she came up in the industry the total feminist icon that she is that i never knew all these years you know underneath all the hair
POD1000000045_S0000061	and the costumes and her huge personality she has been so scrappy she is so smart as a businesswoman
POD1000000045_S0000062	she is amazing basically like i feel like all of us know that but i cannot say it enough
POD1000000045_S0000064	okay so here she is she is 74 years old drops a new album with a lot of original music on it
POD1000000045_S0000065	it is called a holly dolly christmas and it is so great so she has recorded a few on here that are just like your standard christmas music
POD1000000045_S0000066	she has got holly jolly christmas on here she also has you know like i saw mommy kissing santa claus she has mary did you know
POD1000000045_S0000067	so some classics but then she does have original music that she has just written and recorded again the woman is in her 70s and still is making this incredible music
POD1000000045_S0000068	and the fun thing is is that she has a lot of duets on here as well so she has got a duet with like michael buble which that is really expected for you know a christmas album
POD1000000045_S0000069	but did you expect miley cyrus to be on a christmas album
POD1000000045_S0000070	no that is interesting
POD1000000045_S0000071	yeah it really is and she also has another duet with miley is dad billy ray on here
POD1000000045_S0000073	so it is really great you guys it is on spotify it is on apple music amazon music all the places that you listen to music you can find a holly dolly christmas i encourage you to look for the bonus version
POD1000000045_S0000074	because she just dropped a special bonus track that she performed live recently on her holly jolly christmas tv special
POD1000000045_S0000075	this song is called i still believe i might start crying thinking about it she wrote it just for 2020 it is a true like
POD1000000045_S0000076	0 my gosh we are going to make it through this together but i mean it is dolly singing but also she has a gospel choir backing her up it is so good
POD1000000045_S0000077	so again that is on the bonus version of this album it is the sort of secret bonus track that she dropped it is really great katie i got to tell you i think if you like dolly even if you do not you just want some fresh new christmas music in your life i think you will like it so
POD1000000045_S0000078	that sounds so good i am going to go look for that

POD1000000045_S0000110	all right katie i hope you are ready for me to just basically put the microphone in your hands and lead us through
POD1000000045_S0000112	what we are going to talk about in just a little bit like i said katie did publish her 1st book this year it is a middle grade novel we are going to talk all about that here in just a few minutes
POD1000000045_S0000113	so i definitely want you guys to stick around for that part of the conversation i cannot wait katie for us to talk about what that has been like releasing a book in the year 2020 i am sure that has been an experience too
POD1000000045_S0000115	but i thought you know what let us talk about what we might have missed in books and reading this year but i wanted to kind of break it down into categories
POD1000000045_S0000116	because we have 1000s and 1000s and 1000s of women who listen every week so of course in a group that big there is going to be you know certain kinds of readers so i thought okay let us think about like what are some of the categories of readers
POD1000000045_S0000117	because i know if i tell you a category i know i can count on katie to pick out a book for that reader so i picked out 7 categories
POD1000000045_S0000118	i am going to throw the category at you you tell us what you think would be a good read that something that you have picked up recently and speaking of picking it up recently
POD1000000045_S0000119	i thought the 1st category that would be fun would be like the buzz book reader this is the reader who loves to be in the loop on the books that everybody is talking about whether you hang out in like a facebook group that is devoted to reading or you just like to you know
POD1000000045_S0000120	i was going to say at dinner parties whatever those were
POD1000000045_S0000122	if you just like to chat with people about what you have been reading and you like a good book that everybody has been talking about katie what are some good picks for our readers who love buzzy books
POD1000000045_S0000123	okay so the 1st one that came to mind for this category i just read in september i think and it is called the invisible life of addie larue
POD1000000045_S0000124	i have that sorry i got so excited i have been interrupting you already okay go ahead yes
POD1000000045_S0000126	the author is v e schwab this book has been everywhere it was a book of the month pick that is how i got it the cover is gorgeous it is black it has got these gold letters it is just beautiful
POD1000000045_S0000127	okay yes i have to tell you i got it as my book of the month pick and i have yet to open it katie sell me on this book
POD1000000045_S0000129	so basic setup is adeline larue she lives in the 1700s she is in a french village outside the city with her parents she basically makes a deal with the devil
POD1000000045_S0000130	who she calls the darkness to get her out of this kind of sticky situation but the catch is that she will live basically forever and free
POD1000000045_S0000131	but that anytime someone sees her once they turn their back on her they totally forget she ever existed
POD1000000045_S0000132	so the story bounces back and forth between the 1700s and then 2014 where somebody remembers her for the 1st time in her 300 years of life
POD1000000045_S0000133	so that is where our story bounces off from there and i just loved it the writing is absolutely gorgeous the experiences that she has i am sure you can imagine they make for some really interesting you know meetings with people
POD1000000045_S0000135	they forget her immediately and so i just really loved it there is a lot of art and literature and writing kind of built into the story too that just i loved it
POD1000000045_S0000136	okay i feel so proud of myself that even in a year where i am not connected to reading i actually picked a book that everyone is talking about so there you go maybe over the christmas break i will have a little time to finally crack it open and read it
POD1000000045_S0000137	yes i have heard the audio is very good too that is not how i read it but i have heard that it is very good on audio as well
POD1000000045_S0000138	perfect perfect okay did you have any other picks for the busy
POD1000000045_S0000140	one more and this was one of the ones that was up for best book of the year on goodreads and this is called the girl with the louding voice by abby duray
POD1000000045_S0000141	it is also got a gorgeous cover this is a debut novel which i was like shocked while reading it because it is so good but this book follows 14 year old aduni and she is a nigerian girl
POD1000000045_S0000142	living also in like the countryside and her father sells her into basically a marriage into this man is 3rd wife and all she wants to do in her life is learn and read and be not somebody is wife or mother and so
POD1000000045_S0000143	something kind of tragic happens in their household that forces her to leave where she is and she goes to the city to work to basically be an indentured servant for this other kind of wealthy family
POD1000000045_S0000144	and so that is all i want to say because i do not want to spoil it but it is so good her english is a little rough in the beginning like you can see the transformation of her as she learns more which is great
POD1000000045_S0000145	but it does take a little bit getting used to the kind of dialect in the beginning but i did not have too much of a problem with it i have also heard that is really good on audio if you want to listen to that
POD1000000045_S0000146	okay tell me the name of it one more time
POD1000000045_S0000147	it is called the girl with the louding voice by abby duray
POD1000000045_S0000148	okay those both sound so good and yeah i love hearing those picks that it is like these are the books that all of the readers who are in the know this is what everybody is talking about
POD1000000045_S0000149	so i think i might actually maybe be like a secret
POD1000000045_S0000151	okay so the 2nd category that i thought might be fun is something i think a lot of our austims can maybe relate to and this is the stuck in a slump reader
POD1000000045_S0000152	this is a reader who usually does love to read but 2020 has just like zapped their energy and it has zapped the fun out of reading
POD1000000045_S0000153	so i am wondering if you have a pick or 2 for people who again they are usually readers but this year they just kind of got stuck in a little bit of a slump what might snap us out of a slump
POD1000000045_S0000154	so when anybody asks me when they are in a reading slump what they should do i usually say 2 things i say pick a favorite reread which i can not bring to the show because i do not know all of these people and what they want to reread
POD1000000045_S0000155	or i say pick a really sweet middle grade book and i know middle grade is not for everybody but i feel like middle grade books are just so hopeful and sweet usually
POD1000000045_S0000156	and they are really easy to read like they are really fast so you can get through a story pretty quickly so i am going to tell about one middle grade book that i loved and then i am also just going to throw in another fun adult book just for in case we have middle grade people who do not love middle grade
POD1000000045_S0000157	but one of my favorite middle grade books this year was called the lonely heart of maybell lane by kate 0 shaughnessy this was also a debut novel
POD1000000045_S0000158	maybel is 11 and she is estranged from her father who is like a radio dj and she wants nothing more than to meet him and kind of have him know who she is
POD1000000045_S0000159	her mom leaves her with this neighbor woman while she goes to search for a job it is like over the summer and this neighbor actually happens to be one of her teachers from school
POD1000000045_S0000160	and so she kind of like cons this neighbor lady to take her to a singing contest where her father will be so that she can meet her dad
POD1000000045_S0000161	and then another boy from her school kind of accidentally tags along so they go on this road trip
POD1000000045_S0000162	they have these experiences it is kind of one of those like make your own family kind of situations which i love a book about like a come piecemeal family
POD1000000045_S0000164	yeah
POD1000000045_S0000166	that one was very sweet i loved that one
POD1000000045_S0000167	you know before you tell us your next pick i have to say and we will talk about this when we get to your book that i love a middle grade novel and i think i really fell in love with them not even necessarily when i was in those middle grades
POD1000000045_S0000168	although i did certainly a lot of reading at the time but when i was working on my as of yet incomplete master is in libraries
POD1000000045_S0000171	like decades ago but i took a couple of young adult literature classes and so here i was as a young adult you know i was in my early 20s and i was assigned these middle grade novels and 0 my goodness you are so right they are usually so engaging
POD1000000045_S0000172	so enchanting the action picks up from the beginning again because if you are thinking about a classical you know middle grade actual reader you got to grab that attention right away and so there is not a lot of like
POD1000000045_S0000173	story set up and you know it really gets you right into the action and that is a perfect pick for if you are in a reading slump and you just want to pick up a book and just take off with it
POD1000000045_S0000174	i love that so i am a huge fan of the middle grade and again we will talk a little bit more about that here in just a few minutes but what is another pick for the stuck in a slump reader
POD1000000045_S0000175	okay so this one is called the house in the cerulean sea by t j klein you have probably seen this cover all over the place too because it has been very popular this year
POD1000000045_S0000176	but it starts off with this man named linus baker and he works for a government agency and he gets sent on this kind of special assignment to this island there is an orphanage on an island
POD1000000045_S0000177	and there is these kids and they all have these weird magical abilities so and they are not things that you are necessarily familiar with and one of the kids is it is kind of a scary situation so he is a little bit nervous
POD1000000045_S0000178	he takes his cat with him he goes to this island and he stays at the orphanage and he is supposed to be like sending reports back to the government agency about the orphanage and the man who runs the orphanage
POD1000000045_S0000179	but i picked this one for in a slump reader because it is just the sweetest most fun little fantasy book that it is just felt like i was getting a hug from this guy while i was reading this book so i loved it
POD1000000045_S0000180	tell me the name of it again
POD1000000045_S0000181	the house in the cerulean sea by t j klein
POD1000000045_S0000182	gosh what a gorgeous title that is too
POD1000000045_S0000183	yes
POD1000000045_S0000184	i love that both of your stuck in a slump picks are feel good books because i do think sometimes especially if you find yourself as like an energy victim of 2020 like it is just zapped your energy
POD1000000045_S0000185	you may have some trepidation about starting a book because nobody wants more hard stuff right now our lives are hard enough as it is
POD1000000045_S0000186	but a feel good book i think you are right it can kind of unlock that 0 my gosh now i remember why i love reading moment for people
POD1000000045_S0000187	so great okay so here is another category to throw at you what would you recommend for the serious literature reader
POD1000000045_S0000188	the people who when they walk into a bookstore they head straight for that literary fiction shelf like serious reading katie what do you have for us
POD1000000045_S0000189	okay so my favorite one this year hands down was called the book of longings by sue monk kidd
POD1000000045_S0000190	and this one can be a little controversial because it follows the life of anna who is the fictional wife of jesus
POD1000000045_S0000192	did you tell me about this
POD1000000045_S0000194	i was like i know somebody told me to read this book this year and it was you okay yes
POD1000000045_S0000195	and so we start off meeting anna she is kind of put into a precarious social situation that makes her kind of unmarriageable but jesus marries her
POD1000000045_S0000196	and so we get to see her life as his wife and she does not really talk too much about jesus as god like his divinity it is more about his humanity piece
POD1000000045_S0000197	and so to get to see that side of how she kind of interpreted how jesus the man would be with his wife and then she is also a writer which is why i love this book so much she has this really cool bowl
POD1000000045_S0000198	that she writes prayers in and her dad gets her papyrus you know she wants to write these stories of women that are forgotten basically so she has this collection of stories about women
POD1000000045_S0000199	so it kind of just follows her life throughout and i just loved it i thought it was so beautifully done and i just i just loved it
POD1000000045_S0000200	well sumat kid of course you know like just such a treasure of
POD1000000045_S0000201	contemporary american literature so i can only imagine i remember you highly recommended this to me i have had other people say have you read the book is it the book of longings
POD1000000045_S0000203	okay
POD1000000045_S0000204	the book of longings
POD1000000045_S0000205	yes i just have heard a lot of people a lot of people have pointed me in that direction so i feel like yes the stars are aligning for me to pick that one up
POD1000000045_S0000207	i will say if anybody is uncomfortable with maybe like the content of this there is a great author is note in the back where she kind of explains how she did it
POD1000000045_S0000208	katie cobb on currently reading is the reason i read this book in the 1st place and she is the one who suggested read the author is note 1st to see if that is going to kind of make you feel iffy about it like faith wise but i did not have any issue with it and i ended up really loving it
POD1000000045_S0000209	good good good stuff okay any other literary fiction picks
POD1000000045_S0000210	okay so i also loved this tender land by william kent kruger this was technically published last year but i read it this year so i am going to count it i think it was kind of later in the year
POD1000000045_S0000211	so this one is kind of like an odyssey retelling like odyssey meets huck finn if you will
POD1000000045_S0000212	interesting i like that
POD1000000045_S0000213	the main character is odie and his brother they are at one of those native american boarding schools they are not native americans i do not remember how they ended up there but they are at this school
POD1000000045_S0000214	they have a good friend and then there is another little girl and something happens that makes them have to leave their school and so they are on this journey to search for odie and his brother is aunt who is in a different city
POD1000000045_S0000215	and they like take off down the river in a canoe and they meet all these different kinds of people and have all these experiences and i just really loved it the scenery was gorgeous the storytelling was gorgeous
POD1000000045_S0000216	it is another one of those like mismatched family kind of stories and i just really loved it
POD1000000045_S0000217	okay that sounds so fascinating what a great context for a story to start in i like that
POD1000000045_S0000218	and awesomes too as you are listening do not worry about jotting any of these down we will put a full list in the show notes with links and also these categories
POD1000000045_S0000219	so if one of these stood out to you and you are like 0 wait i am a serious literature reader then you can go like right to the list and find the ones that katie has picked for you
POD1000000045_S0000220	okay so this is so great i have a few more categories the next one is this one i am super personally invested in because this is totally me the delighted by nonfiction reader
POD1000000045_S0000221	if i am reading a lot during the year i am almost always reading a lot of nonfiction so we are talking memoir or biography i love essay collections
POD1000000045_S0000222	anything where it is just really beautiful to read and it is also a nonfiction i mean i also love my share of self help books as well
POD1000000045_S0000224	for those of us who get into the nonfiction every year katie what are some of your picks in that realm
POD1000000045_S0000225	one of the best ones i read this year was called after the last border 2 families and the story of refuge in america
POD1000000045_S0000226	this one is incredible she is a journalist and writer who works closely with refugees that live in austin texas and she worked really closely with these 2 women
POD1000000045_S0000227	the 1st one is named muna and she is from myanmar and her family came with her to austin that was in the early 2000s and then hasna came from syria with her family
POD1000000045_S0000228	more recently and so she tells these stories of these women kind of in a chronological order of where they were how they came to get here what happened to their families along the way
POD1000000045_S0000229	and then she intersperses it with more informational chapters about the u s immigration and refugee policy which i found very interesting because i do not feel like i knew a lot about this
POD1000000045_S0000230	it is one of those topics that people like to talk about but i do not know that they know much about it so i really appreciate it it read like a novel for me i could not wait to sit down again and pick up these women is stories
POD1000000045_S0000231	you know their resilience and their courage and i just thought it was really good i want everyone to read it
POD1000000045_S0000232	i have had that on my list since the 1st day i even heard about it before it actually published obviously refugee issues and refugee policy in america is close to my heart we did a whole episode on that way back at the beginning of 2017
POD1000000045_S0000233	when i was just researching for that episode which we had to do a really quick turnaround on that i learned so much i was like 0 my gosh i had no idea about any of this
POD1000000045_S0000234	so i have had this book on my list for so long i am so glad you brought it up because i absolutely want to dig into that one very soon after the last border
POD1000000045_S0000235	another one for nonfiction and this one is a little bit lighter it is not as information heavy but this one is called native and it is by caitlin b curtis
POD1000000045_S0000236	and she is a christian woman and she is also a member of the potawatomi nation and she kind of just has a lot of reflections on her christian faith and how that intersects with her native roots
POD1000000045_S0000237	and getting back to those you know stories and just her heritage and then how that kind of affects her christian faith as she goes through it i love everything she talked about she talked about the church she talked about racial issues in the church and
POD1000000045_S0000238	you know inclusion and white supremacy and also just like her love for jesus and her love for nature and all the things and i really liked that one too
POD1000000045_S0000239	yes 0 my goodness that sounds so intriguing to me and again of course growing up in oklahoma
POD1000000045_S0000240	there is this really strong intersection of you know like sort of standard american culture then also living side by side with the native american culture and the different nations that
POD1000000045_S0000241	were moved to oklahoma like i just have this sort of familiarity with it but not enough to like really have done like a deep dive into how that all fits together with christianity especially christianity in america so
POD1000000045_S0000242	that sounds fantastic i love that
POD1000000045_S0000243	yeah it was really good i listened on audio and she reads it so it is really nice to hear her voice you know tell you her story and i really like that
POD1000000045_S0000244	yes fantastic okay next category let us take a little bit of a turn into something a little fluffier maybe because category number 5 i thought it would be fun to talk about the beach reader
POD1000000045_S0000245	since most of us missed our summer vacations this year and that might be when we pick up a lighter read to check out maybe to take to the beach or wherever we are traveling
POD1000000045_S0000246	katie what are some of those more like beachy reads that we missed out on this year
POD1000000045_S0000247	okay so i do not read a ton in this category but my 1st one is called beach read by emily henry and this one the title is a little misleading because it actually takes place at a lake but
POD1000000045_S0000248	the setup is that january is a romance writer she is in a writing slump she goes to stay at her father is lake house after he dies and then next door is actually her college writing author nemesis named gus
POD1000000045_S0000249	and he is also having some writer is block so they kind of make this bet that she is going to write like the next american novel he is going to write a rom com and they are going to like flip back and forth and share notes and you know
POD1000000045_S0000250	it is cute and fun and sexy but there is also like a depth to it i do not love like just the fluff because there is some grief and there is some you know betrayal and some kind of things that go into it
POD1000000045_S0000251	that give it a little bit more of like depth to the cute fun romance part so i really liked that one i thought it was fun
POD1000000045_S0000252	yes beach read is one that i actually did read this year and it is so good it is just what you exactly said it is so fun i feel like the dialog and the back and forth between january and gus it is like so snappy and so good
POD1000000045_S0000253	so funny but you are absolutely right there is so much depth to each of their backstories what they are working through what they are processing highly recommend that one i think emily henry is a great writer so yay i love that one
POD1000000045_S0000254	okay another one that i liked this year is called the happy ever after playlist by abby jimenez this one it is like a companion novel to her 1st one which i do not remember the title now but you do not have to read the 1st one so you can pick this one up by itself
POD1000000045_S0000255	so sloane is our main character she is an artist her life is kind of falling apart and this dog like jumps into her car one day and she has to figure out whose dog this is and what is going on
POD1000000045_S0000256	and so she finds the owner of the dog and he is actually overseas for the next couple of months so she agrees to take care of the dog they communicate 1st like on text
POD1000000045_S0000257	and then she finds out who this guy is and he is pretty famous and so she is like i am talking to this famous guy and taking care of his dog
POD1000000045_S0000258	and so their relationship kind of starts over text and then they meet and you know etc etc so i thought this one is really fun it is really easy to read there is lots of fun music
POD1000000045_S0000260	yes
POD1000000045_S0000261	so cute and fun and sexy
POD1000000045_S0000262	i mean if you are going to give me a meet cute that involves a dog and you are telling me music is interwoven in the story i am like well it sounds like a good critter for me so i could definitely pick that one up too
POD1000000045_S0000263	okay next category is the expand my views reader so this is the reader who loves to read about experiences of other people
POD1000000045_S0000264	kind of outside their own context whether it is outside of maybe their religious beliefs or their cultural background
POD1000000045_S0000265	the reader who really takes up the promise that reading gives us that you can learn about like anything anything in the world you can learn people is perspectives you can learn about people is experiences
POD1000000045_S0000266	if you give it a chance when you are reading so what are some expand my views picks that you might have for us katie
POD1000000045_S0000267	i will be sharing my screen
POD1000000045_S0000268	she is on instagram at sitting pretty and i love her instagram profile and all of her content so she is this is kind of like a memoir essay collection
POD1000000045_S0000269	about a woman who has been in a wheelchair most of her life so she talks about things like dating
POD1000000045_S0000270	and working and her family life and how she was treated as a child and how people treat her in public and what happens when people try to help her too much when she does not want help
POD1000000045_S0000271	so she brings up a lot of important issues about ableism and how she feels in her body she is really funny and gracious and i just really liked it
POD1000000045_S0000272	i did this one on audio which she also reads and so just having that experience of her telling you about her life this is a really really good one
POD1000000045_S0000273	okay yes i have seen her instagram account before and i know that it has really
POD1000000045_S0000274	resonated with so many people i mean talk about expanding your views and helping you to understand somebody else is perspective that is different from your own and so i bet that that is absolutely an incredible read
POD1000000045_S0000275	and then i also for this category wanted to make sure that i talk about cast by isabel wilkerson this is one you have probably seen everywhere too it is big but isabel wilkerson is probably one of the most brilliant women i have ever read in my life
POD1000000045_S0000277	she took 10 years to research and write this book
POD1000000045_S0000278	wow 0 my gosh okay
POD1000000045_S0000279	her basic premise is that the way the united states has separated itself out by race she calls it a caste system and she kind of compares it to india is caste system and also nazi germany is caste system
POD1000000045_S0000280	she brings in similarities and also differences between the 2 and then she talks about the history of racism in the united states and how it has evolved from slavery to mass incarceration and then now to where we are with all of the issues
POD1000000045_S0000281	surrounding race in the country now so i really loved reading this even though it was really hard i read it with a buddy which was good because we had to kind of process after each day
POD1000000045_S0000282	but it is very readable it is not like a textbook she writes in a really like narrative y kind of way she tells all these stories of people you have never heard about like why have not i heard this before
POD1000000045_S0000283	and so i just really liked that one i thought it was a very like mind opening kind of book so i wanted to
POD1000000045_S0000285	and what a perfect tree to pick up in 2020 as this has come to the surface nationally and collectively for us again that is a great pick for this year for sure
POD1000000045_S0000286	so okay last category before i really turn the mic over to you to talk about your book and your publishing journey but before we do that i want to talk about the reluctant reader now
POD1000000045_S0000287	a lot of us who are parents maybe are more familiar with this phrase because maybe we have children who are reluctant readers they can read but they just they are really resistant to it
POD1000000045_S0000288	hey some of us said it is still the case in adulthood some of us would maybe rather just turn on netflix and see what is on instead of reading i am wondering if you have a few picks for a reader that they could just pick up and not be able to put down
POD1000000045_S0000289	sure so when i was teaching 4th grade when i had reluctant readers my go to was like to hand them a graphic novel because graphic novels are so fun and i really love them as an adult too i love to look through the pictures and read the story
POD1000000045_S0000290	so my favorite graphic novel of this year is called when stars are scattered and it is written by omar mohamed and victoria jamison it is a true story of omar and his brother hassan and they live in a refugee camp in kenya
POD1000000045_S0000291	and so it kind of tells you about their overall daily life and then their process of going through the un and then coming to america
POD1000000045_S0000292	but his brother is a person with disabilities and so he feels like he has to just take care of his brother all the time
POD1000000045_S0000293	and so it is a very sweet story about brothers it is very informative about refugees and the you know kind of the things that they have to go through and then it is really hopeful
POD1000000045_S0000294	because it is middle grade and you have to be hopeful in middle grade so i loved it the illustrations are and the story are just so compelling i sat down and read the entire thing and it was so good
POD1000000045_S0000295	sounds fantastic i love it i love it
POD1000000045_S0000296	okay but if graphic novels are not your thing something that i love to do when i am feeling a little bit like i do not want to read i pick up a ya fantasy because ya fantasies are so fun and they usually have a series to go with them and you can read like 5 in a row
POD1000000045_S0000297	this one only has 2 and it is not necessarily a fantasy but it is an alternate history so the 1st one is called dread nation and the author is justina ireland
POD1000000045_S0000298	so the alternate history is that the civil war had to pause because zombies yes zombies were taking over
POD1000000045_S0000299	and so they took all these former slaves and children and put them in these training schools to basically kill the zombies that is their new job
POD1000000045_S0000300	so we have jane mckean is our main character she is snarky and spicy and strong she is just like one of those characters you want to be friends with because she is great
POD1000000045_S0000301	she and others from her training school get sent to this settlement out west and it is kind of like a creepy situation they get there and they are like yeah things are not all as they seem here
POD1000000045_S0000302	and so the adventure kind of takes off from there now if you had asked me before reading this if i liked zombie books i would have said no
POD1000000045_S0000303	but i listened to this one on audio and bonnie turpin reads it and she is like the queen of audio books in my opinion i love her
POD1000000045_S0000304	and i just got pulled in right away listened to the 2nd one as soon as i could get my hands on it the sequel is just as good and it came out this year and that one is called the deathless divide
POD1000000045_S0000305	and so there is just tons of action tons of zombies you know there is some friendship situations and things it was really fun and i was surprised that i liked it but i really really loved it so
POD1000000045_S0000306	i mean is not that just like the magic of books that a book exists that imagines a world
POD1000000045_S0000307	where it is the civil war and also zombie apocalypse
POD1000000045_S0000309	i love it that is incredible what a great pick that is and i think you are so right too i do a lot a lot a lot of reading via audio book
POD1000000045_S0000310	not all of it but a lot and so you know anyone that is like i do not know if i want to read but you are still doing your daily walks with your dog
POD1000000045_S0000311	or you are trying to get on the treadmill every now and again or like anytime where you have a little space that you can fill it in with audio after you listen to sort of awesome you could put on an audio book and get some reading done
POD1000000045_S0000312	i do not think enough people put enough emphasis in their lives on the fact that you can totally read books via audio that is a very legitimate way to read
POD1000000045_S0000313	well and i was like very anti audiobook until like the middle of last year because i had not really tried one i was like listen i am going to get bored like i am going to not focus again it was katie
POD1000000045_S0000314	currently reading who is like i am sad for you that you do not like audiobooks and i was like fine i will try one and i have probably listened to more audiobooks this year than i have done any
POD1000000045_S0000316	i love it yes
POD1000000045_S0000317	i also discovered that you can turn the speed up which i do not think a lot of people know if you are just like audiobook newbies you can turn the speed up because they read very slowly
POD1000000045_S0000318	i have gotten myself to where i can listen at a pretty fast rate and still understand everything that they are saying and that has been really how i consume a lot of books
POD1000000045_S0000319	and i think correct me if i am wrong but i think katie cobb again on currently reading podcast has even said that is how she gets through so many books is if you listen on audio and if you just you do not even have to crank it up like crazy fast if you just knock the speed up just a little tiny bit
POD1000000045_S0000320	you will be amazed at how much more quickly you can get through a book and again since i do a lot of reading that is nonfiction i have no issues at all with just bumping that speed up because i just kind of want to get through whatever it is
POD1000000045_S0000321	yeah so great so those are katie 0 my gosh what a list you have given us that is a huge gift just in time for the holidays you guys katie is giving us this gift
POD1000000045_S0000322	to inspire your reading maybe we can all take this list and get a good head start on reading for 2021 so

POD1000000045_S0000345	okay katie 2020 it has been a rough year but you had a big life moment happen when you published your 1st book it is called my storied year
POD1000000045_S0000346	so let us see where should we even start i would love to hear kind of where did the story come to you 1st of all give us a little snapshot of what my story dear is about
POD1000000045_S0000347	and then maybe tell us the story of how did this story come into your life into your mind walk us through a little bit of how the process was from taking it from like 0 i have this idea to now you can hold it in your hands you wrote a book you are an author tell us everything
POD1000000045_S0000348	okay so my story here starts with dragon stewart he is a 7th grader and he is dyslexic and he has a really hard life at home and he has got some bullying situations going on at school
POD1000000045_S0000349	but this year he has a new set of teachers and some new kids in his class and his english teacher who is my favorite really kind of pulls out the writer in him he is like a secret poet he has this journal that he carries around and writes poetry
POD1000000045_S0000350	but otherwise does not really like to read or write because it is hard for him and he has kind of this secret story that he does not really know if he should tell it or how he should tell it and so
POD1000000045_S0000351	through the year he kind of opens up to his friends more and then he is able to kind of reveal his story and so that is the basic premise of it
POD1000000045_S0000352	0 my goodness you have sent a copy it is on the way to me i cannot wait again i love love love a middle grade novel and this just feels so heartwarming already just hearing you set up the story
POD1000000045_S0000353	you have mentioned that you taught elementary was that kind of a jumping off point for you in terms of how this character came into your mind
POD1000000045_S0000355	so when i taught writing was my absolute favorite thing to teach i did a lot of extensive training on writing and a lot of the things that she does in the book there is kind of like little writing lessons along the way that you could do with your kids if you were homeschooling them or even teachers in the classroom
POD1000000045_S0000356	but a lot of those things i learned through my trainings and so i wanted to pull in like the whole writing is therapy almost for people you know how we put things into words and how our creativity kind of find out who we are and so
POD1000000045_S0000357	i wanted to pull in that aspect of it and dragon is really kind of a mixture of a lot of kids that i taught you know i had some hard kids you are going to teach for any amount of time you are going to have some kids with some hard lives and so
POD1000000045_S0000358	he is a mixture of a bunch of different ones and i just had the beginning of my teaching i did not understand these kids because that was not my life experience i grew up in a 2 parent household and
POD1000000045_S0000359	you know we were always financially stable and so i did not struggle like that and so when i met these kids it was almost like i can not believe people like this exist you know i did not have that context and so
POD1000000045_S0000360	i learned over the course of my years how to help these kids get through their daily lives and how to do things to help them and i wish i had done more looking back you always wish you had done more
POD1000000045_S0000362	yeah
POD1000000045_S0000363	but dragon is just a mixture of all those kids so i wanted kids to be able to see that kids like this are real and that they do have real problems and how you know
POD1000000045_S0000364	they need support at school from their friends from their teachers i wanted to write it for teachers to see how you know they can be so important in these kids lives especially if their home life is not stable
POD1000000045_S0000365	you know their teacher might be their one adult that loves them and so i wanted to put that in the book too
POD1000000045_S0000366	yes yeah that is so true i mean teachers can have a huge impact on our lives sometimes not even in a good way but definitely in positive ways
POD1000000045_S0000367	and i think that can happen at any point along our journey but i think those middle grade years are so tender and so formative and
POD1000000045_S0000368	when you have a teacher in your life that really sees you and is really able to help you to discover who you are that is absolutely an actual life changer
POD1000000045_S0000369	yeah what a great context to set the story in as you have this idea and so it is obviously going to be fiction in the fiction writing process and maybe this even differs depending on if you are writing children is or middle grade or ya or adult
POD1000000045_S0000370	do you fully write the book and then start to go to agents or publishers and say okay i have this thing or do you talk on the publishing end 1st and then go and write like what was that process like for you
POD1000000045_S0000371	so it is different for fiction and nonfiction which i did not even know until i had kind of gone through it but what happened was i wrote and it was not even this book that i wrote i wrote another manuscript
POD1000000045_S0000372	there is a huge writing conference in dallas fort worth called dfw con and it is a big writing conference
POD1000000045_S0000373	with your conference ticket you get 10 minutes with a literary agent to pitch your work at that point i had a finished manuscript and when i was kind of researching the conference for fiction they want you to have a complete manuscript
POD1000000045_S0000374	before you ever contact anybody for nonfiction it is a little bit different because they want to make sure that they can sell the book before you go like write all of it they see if you have a platform and you write a proposal and all that stuff but the book does not necessarily have to be done
POD1000000045_S0000375	for fiction generally they want you to have a complete manuscript before you start pitching it to anybody so i sat down with this agent i kind of gave her my elevator pitch about the book
POD1000000045_S0000376	and then she asked me to send her the full manuscript which is kind of the best thing that you can hear at a conference because some people will say i will pass on this or send me 5 pages or whatever she asked for the full thing
POD1000000045_S0000377	so i sent it to her and then you know 6810 months later she got i mean it is a long waiting process
POD1000000045_S0000378	because they have so many manuscripts that are coming into them and they have to read them and this woman actually ended up being my agent and i am so grateful for her because she did not just send back like i do not want this
POD1000000045_S0000379	she sent back a list of really helpful notes for revisions and she said if you want to like revise and then resubmit i will be happy to look at it again she was like i do not think we can sell it as it is right now but i will be happy to look at it again
POD1000000045_S0000380	so i took her notes did a lot of things worked with a professional editor and then sent it back to her and then she agreed to represent me so that is kind of how that situation went but that was like a year long process probably from start to finish
POD1000000045_S0000381	and then once she has it i still went back and rewrote it probably 2 or 3 times not a major rehaul but just like these parts need to be fixed
POD1000000045_S0000382	and then she started to shop it to publishers so she did the same thing i did to find an agent she had to send out letters and samples and all that stuff to different publishers until we found one
POD1000000045_S0000383	my publishing journey is kind of like wacky because my publisher bought the 1st book that i wrote but then they said what else does she have so we sent her my story year
POD1000000045_S0000384	and then they were like we want to publish this 11st they felt like it was really timely and they wanted to get it out there
POD1000000045_S0000386	1st and then the 1st book that i sold will actually come out in june so that is like a totally different book but they wanted to get this one out
POD1000000045_S0000387	is it a middle grade novel too
POD1000000045_S0000388	it is also middle grade and it is historical fiction so it is totally like on a different level than this one but yes
POD1000000045_S0000389	that is fascinating i mean you say that the timeline was a little wacky but if i have learned anything from my friends who are authors it is that like the timeline is always crazy like everything takes so long
POD1000000045_S0000390	and then sometimes you write the like i have had friends who are nonfiction authors who write the whole thing submit it and then the publisher is like yeah no we do not want to do this after all i mean there is always like so many twists and turns on the publishing journey
POD1000000045_S0000391	so i can only imagine yeah that every single one i am sure has surprises along the way some maybe are not so happy surprises but what has surprised you in a way that you really like this was a happy surprise about the publishing process
POD1000000045_S0000392	the thing that surprised me the most that was not really happy was how long it took because you know like i am like i wrote this book and let us get it out i did not realize how long of a process it is from like getting it from a raw draft to an actual book
POD1000000045_S0000393	but i think the thing that surprised me in the best way is that i have just met so many good people that like my editor is one of my favorite people she is gracious but she is tough and she is you know cut this you know
POD1000000045_S0000394	let us fix this part because it is not quite working and i just learned a lot about myself as a writer and about good writing and so that has been really really good
POD1000000045_S0000395	i also want to encourage anybody who is writing to find yourself a writing group and it does not have to be someone you meet with like my writing group i found from sorta awesome we are in the sorta awesome writers
POD1000000045_S0000396	and so we are all over the place like i am in texas and there is one in new york and one in lebanon and one in connecticut
POD1000000045_S0000397	and we just all we send each other our work every week and we have a voxer that we can process through all of our writing questions and you know the days that we are like this is horrible why am i doing this we have a place for that so that has been really really helpful
POD1000000045_S0000398	0 my gosh that gives me chills i love that part of the story obviously

POD1000000046_S0000057	
POD1000000046_S0000058	and it is just like .

POD1000000046_S0000134	both ways present their challenges like not every time does that work for you and not every time does my way work
POD1000000046_S0000135	but sometimes they both work right
POD1000000046_S0000137	i do not know
POD1000000046_S0000138	it does not always work for you you have to admit it does not always work for you to go in and be an asshole
POD1000000046_S0000140	remember the last time it has not worked
POD1000000046_S0000141	define work you know what i mean working it is like did you get i do not know
POD1000000046_S0000142	i got all the things all of the things that i ordered whatever i ordered and paid for i look at it like old school like fucking medieval times shit where you are just bartering with people
POD1000000046_S0000143	money or a credit card is the same thing as like a fucking puka shell or it is like 0 can i can i change it for your food you are a great hunter and i have got this jewel that you need to give your wife like can we just

POD1000000046_S0000146	and you can figure the fuck out on the back end because all it is is all these people just do not want to do paperwork for shit that is it so if you just walk in drop it off then they will be forced to do the paperwork because they do not have a goddamn choice
POD1000000046_S0000147	and if they go through the system then it is like 0 man when was that supposed to be here 0 that is why that guy walked in in the middle of fucking christmas and just dropped off a dryer in the middle of the store and said fuck everyone you know what i am saying

POD1000000046_S0000259	taylor swift and drop the paperback and all that other shit to beat the amazon bullshit i understand you do not want to be on the new york times bestseller list again so you are not releasing the hardback that is the way to get there

POD1000000046_S0000265	get all that shit too
POD1000000046_S0000266	and it oddly made me jealous where i was just like 0 fuck i could grind out another one of these goddamn things easily if i had the time i just do not have the time for it and this one took like a year
POD1000000046_S0000267	family
POD1000000046_S0000268	it is not that this one took a year these things are so hard to write because every other line is a one liner it is a joke so it is like you have
POD1000000046_S0000269	constantly got to update and refresh and make these jokes as fresh as they can possibly be but also in a time period way and like it is very very difficult
POD1000000046_S0000270	but otherwise yeah dude everybody is like man i want another one and i am like dude you are going to get it you are going to get it in 2 years
POD1000000046_S0000271	it is not going to be now or my wife is going to leave me and that is what it is but then i look at taylor swift 0 is this your 2nd album you are putting out this year

POD1000000046_S0000499	it is all worth it it is the craziest one of the craziest events we have ever been to i was just like what the fuck is happening but .
POD1000000046_S0000500	yeah it was interesting
POD1000000046_S0000501	it was awesome so we will we will talk about it and then you keep donating money for georgio i will match it and then we will see

POD1000000046_S0000513	tally of this so that way we know you do not have to follow any notes the rest of the show just keep a running tally here so we know what we have but i would imagine we are 3 or $400 short of sending giorgio to joe rogan and dave chappelle for christmas
POD1000000046_S0000514	this would be hilarious and fucking awesome so you and i got to go it is super private we had to lock up our phones in what are those called the fucking deardos or durandos

POD1000000046_S0000524	yeah whatever it is right another $5 do thing papa g there it is we are probably 300 or 400 bucks away from getting him to go
POD1000000046_S0000525	with that you had to take a covid test walking in and you get there and they are like hey man you have got to get there the show started at like 7.30
POD1000000046_S0000526	and there was like a 10 comedians that how many would you say we saw 7

POD1000000046_S0000534	we are getting close we are probably 300 bucks away at this point so when you walk in you are like hey man you got to get there at 4.30 pm and it was like shit
POD1000000046_S0000536	for what 0 cause we have got nurses who are in full hospital gowns and a whole goddamn tent set up like it is the side of the road for a covid test
POD1000000046_S0000537	
POD1000000046_S0000538	they jam the pipe cleaner down your nose and then test you really quickly there well 15 minutes we had to wait
POD1000000046_S0000539	yeah
POD1000000046_S0000540	and then
POD1000000046_S0000541	but that is rapid if any hospitals are wondering where the rapid tests are they are at a chappelle show
POD1000000046_S0000542	so right where they need to be
POD1000000046_S0000544	so that up that they have
POD1000000046_S0000545	is honestly better than the side of it is better than any hospital has and you are getting right in there yonder is the name of that phone device by the way

POD1000000046_S0000572	0 you guys are like you guys have like the best seats i was like really and we just kept going to the front and i am like 0 my god this makeshift stage is probably about this tall so it is about as tall as this desk right here
POD1000000046_S0000573	and i what would you say we are 3 feet away 2.5 feet away from them like
POD1000000046_S0000574	the guy that was right across from us on the table

POD1000000046_S0000604	the only thing i did say when we were in the stalls is like from what they are telling us in the world with covid or whatever percentage wise

POD1000000046_S0000611	yeah aj gamble gave $4.69 to giorgio at this concert
POD1000000046_S0000612	you bring somebody to a show like this georgia i am going to be honest with you you deserve a 69 but yeah no one magically tested positive for covid
POD1000000046_S0000614	like crazy but at the end of it it felt like a like we were at somebody is house like a house party where everybody is just gotten super fucked up
POD1000000046_S0000615	so dave chappelle at the end just said because he had a full dj and everything the setup was like chappelle is show to be honest with you
POD1000000046_S0000616	so he could refer back he had him play random songs sometimes of something he was talking about and at the end he was like
POD1000000046_S0000617	he goes i want i mean i just want to i want to feel in love with everybody i love all these people let us just all sing a song together and it was like what
POD1000000046_S0000618	and so he was like yeah let us just sing a song together if i play a song you guys sing it with me we are like yeah fuck it i guess so he plays
POD1000000046_S0000619	he turns around and asks the dj to play radiohead is creep
POD1000000046_S0000620	yeah
POD1000000046_S0000621	by radiohead and so all of these strangers who we had all sat in this stall got shit jammed in our faces everybody is all fucked up eating barbecue i think
POD1000000046_S0000622	we had to watch tony hinchcliffe like .
POD1000000046_S0000623	he was great
POD1000000046_S0000624	i know
POD1000000046_S0000625	he was great i know you are not a fan i was not either but he was great he had the best set of the night to be honest with you
POD1000000046_S0000626	with that we all sang this song with all these fucking strangers everybody is fucked up and like it was an unbelievable night and you are just like .
POD1000000046_S0000627	it was unbelievable the poetic there was something poetic about that because radiohead will not even play creep in their concerts
POD1000000046_S0000628	right right
POD1000000046_S0000629	they refuse to
POD1000000046_S0000630	yeah yeah yeah
POD1000000046_S0000631	like something really beautiful about that happening like the way that it should have happened at an actual radio head content
POD1000000046_S0000632	but i never would have but then you are with chappelle like singing radiohead and it is like 10 times better and joe rogan is just looking at rogan
POD1000000046_S0000633	yeah joe rogan is just looking at chappelle like he wants like he is in love with him
POD1000000046_S0000634	he was just like he did not even say anything for the 2nd encore he was just looking at chappelle like you are amazing
POD1000000046_S0000635	yeah and every single person saying radio here is the thing i am surprised that dave chappelle knew all the words to creep by radio head like
POD1000000046_S0000636	nah man he is cool
POD1000000046_S0000637	yeah either way it was fucking rad and then everybody walked out of there because you do not have phones and you are not allowed to take a picture of it
POD1000000046_S0000638	you are like no one will believe me of what just happened but i think that is also the setup too where it is like hey man we are going to do this thing it is a weird fucking time in the universe
POD1000000046_S0000639	and this is what it is going to be you are a part of it and you will be able to tell this story
POD1000000046_S0000640	luckily we have a show that reaches a gajillion people otherwise .
POD1000000046_S0000641	no one knows about any of the shit that is going on we were like is it that cool yes yes it is
POD1000000046_S0000642	here is also why it is that cool because of the phones not being there so people are allowed to say words they are not supposed to say which i am not going to say it here
POD1000000046_S0000643	but they do not have the fear of a cell phone you know picking up some part of the set that is taken out of context and then because he has been burned many times before
POD1000000046_S0000644	like that yeah they all have
POD1000000046_S0000645	that was that is the beauty of it like look there is no other way for us to do this so you do not have your phones
POD1000000046_S0000646	therefore you are going to get the comedy that you want to get that you used to get and that we want to give you right
POD1000000046_S0000647	without anyone else being involved than the people that paid for it wanted to be here and know exactly what they are getting into right
POD1000000046_S0000648	and everybody who was there dropped all of the words that man even one of those would get you canceled sure
POD1000000046_S0000649	but in the context of the joke
POD1000000046_S0000650	it worked yes you take that out in one clip and put it up somewhere and they are canceled right
POD1000000046_S0000651	what is the running tally georgio what do we got here
POD1000000046_S0000653	we since you told me to start keeping count for about $169 i did not fuck with the change so i just kind of rounded up so it is like $169
POD1000000046_S0000654	that we have gotten no that is not true
POD1000000046_S0000655	since i started counting like drop what you are doing just count this
POD1000000046_S0000656	i am looking at it like
POD1000000046_S0000657	$300 to $500 right now
POD1000000046_S0000658	yeah we are about 3 to 5 i would say we are about 250 short now because i am looking at it at the top so we have all show

POD1000000046_S0000660	i mean that is an easy decision for me to be honest is it i mean if all these people are throwing this money out there dan is a very special person that i have in mind
POD1000000046_S0000662	i have already talked about their butt here today on the show and it is a mister cash register over here really

POD1000000046_S0000664	thoughty that is really worth the 750 ticket and if all these fans are pitched in like this then you know
POD1000000046_S0000665	ah look at that look at that alright we need about $250 more here and that is it

POD1000000046_S0001152	yeah for the sole reason of setting their brand early enough not giving a fuck and literally saying i mean the rant that bill burr went on
POD1000000046_S0001153	about women was legendary could he fucking do that if he did not set that precedent like way back in the day where he is like i do not give a fuck what you can not
POD1000000046_S0001154	yeah yep
POD1000000046_S0001155	cancel me and same with chappelle they just do it
POD1000000046_S0001157	him it is bringing comedy back right and joe rogan was they would they used to say that about him but he is kind of not right like he is sort of backing off a little bit whereas bilber and chappelle are going full force no question saying whatever they want
POD1000000046_S0001158	right
POD1000000046_S0001160	that is so funny bill burr he did this bit on the female kicker from vanderbilt

POD1000000046_S0001234	good afternoon
POD1000000046_S0001235	good afternoon
YOU1000000001_S0000001	hey guys randy with pete is rv tv here today today we are on our way to lone pine campground in malice bay vermont
YOU1000000001_S0000002	we are going to show you how to back up a camper and put it on the site so we will be there in just a minute and we will catch up with you then
YOU1000000001_S0000003	okay here we are at beautiful lone pine campground they are nice enough to let us use the site today so i am just going to pull past my site we are going to be on site 31
YOU1000000001_S0000004	i am going to hop out and take a look at the site and see where i want to put this camper and then we are going to go right ahead and back around the site
YOU1000000001_S0000005	okay so what i have done at this and this is the easiest way to put your camper on the site is i have driven past the site and i have got the site on the driver is side of the truck
YOU1000000001_S0000006	i do that on purpose so i can see where the slide side or the off door side of the camper is going
YOU1000000001_S0000007	because that is the side that we want to keep as far this way as possible to give us more real estate on the usable part of our site
YOU1000000001_S0000008	so if you can all do that when you pull up to your campsite try to keep the driver is side on the site side not all the time you will be able to do that but if you can that is definitely going to work in your benefit
YOU1000000001_S0000009	at this point i just walk the site and see what i have got to avoid
YOU1000000001_S0000010	so i am going to want to keep my camper keep in mind that i have got a slide that is going to go out but i want to keep my camper as far this way as possible to give me as much real estate on that side as i mentioned before
YOU1000000001_S0000011	so this looks like a pretty open site which most campsites are we just got to contend with the stump there
YOU1000000001_S0000012	my power cord is going to be in the back so that will work out perfectly for me so i guess what i am going to do now is just pop back in the truck and see if we can negotiate this guy onto the site
YOU1000000001_S0000013	i am going to pull ahead just a hair and i am going to put the tail of my camper headed in the right direction that i want to back this guy up on
YOU1000000001_S0000014	now very important at this point is remembering that our wheels are the pivot point for our camper so that is where the camper is going to turn
YOU1000000001_S0000015	so i do not want to watch the front of the camper or the back so much i want to keep my eyes on the wheels so here we go
YOU1000000001_S0000016	sometimes when i am driving a different truck this truck is working out pretty well but sometimes i will even angle the mirror down so i can see the wheels a little bit better
YOU1000000001_S0000017	so i will make sure i got nothing going on on the other side of me
YOU1000000001_S0000019	i am just letting the camper do the job here keep an eye on both mirrors obviously turn the steering wheel the opposite way that you want the unit to go
YOU1000000001_S0000021	and as you start getting close to where you want to be straight that is when you want to start counter steering
YOU1000000001_S0000023	we are getting the unit on there pretty straight nothing on the other side
YOU1000000001_S0000025	boy i think i am going to hit this one pretty good right off the bat
YOU1000000001_S0000027	now if you are finding that you are not backing on straight or you know the camper just keeps jackknifing on you a little bit
YOU1000000001_S0000028	maybe you do not have enough room in front of the truck to get the truck out where you need it to to get you straight
YOU1000000001_S0000029	you always can put the truck back in drive and pull forward and straighten the trailer out
YOU1000000001_S0000030	so if you have gone too far past and the camper is going the wrong way or the back end of the camper has gone too far the way you do not want it to go
YOU1000000001_S0000031	simply put the truck in drive and pull straight ahead and that is going to straighten the unit out for you so we are going to just back this guy up here
YOU1000000001_S0000033	i think i have hit my mark
YOU1000000001_S0000035	now this is the point where if you watch my leveling video is where you want to get out and check the camper for level so that is what we are going to do right now
YOU1000000001_S0000036	so that 1st time went very easy because there is not a whole lot of people in the park so now i am going to try to simulate a full park with cars and campers on my other side
YOU1000000001_S0000037	i am going to try to keep my vehicle on the road without going on the lawn over there like i did on the last pull in
YOU1000000001_S0000038	so this time i am going to start backing up a little bit sooner
YOU1000000001_S0000039	i have just got my camper kind of headed and you can see with the camper headed it is going to start to turn even with my truck straight
YOU1000000001_S0000041	the camper is starting to turn more and more i am going to compensate with a hair now
YOU1000000001_S0000043	now i am really going to jackknife this camper
YOU1000000001_S0000045	i will try to swing this thing around now i can start to turn my truck a little bit
YOU1000000001_S0000047	so i have stayed on the road for the most part i have got my camper pretty straight
YOU1000000001_S0000048	but you see the back end of the camper still wants to swing around because i do not have enough room in front of the truck to get it to where i want to go
YOU1000000001_S0000049	this is where people mostly run into trouble so i have got a trick for this too
YOU1000000001_S0000050	if i keep backing up my back end of my camper is just going to keep swinging where i do not want it to swing
YOU1000000001_S0000051	a lot of people will go back and forth and back and forth and they never find that happy spot so what i am going to do at this point is i am just going to stop the truck right here
YOU1000000001_S0000052	and i am going to unhook the camper sounds crazy but this will get you out of a pinch in a 2nd
YOU1000000001_S0000053	okay so as you can see we turned off the camera
YOU1000000001_S0000054	i unhooked the truck from the camper i re situated my truck so now my truck is straight in line with the camper
YOU1000000001_S0000055	and we can continue to back up on the site and now we are not going to be jackknifing or having the camera off angle on our site because i have now straightened the truck out and that was our problem
YOU1000000001_S0000056	so i am going to hop back in the truck and finish backing up on the site and we are going to be good to go here okay so here we go back up for our final destination
YOU1000000001_S0000057	you got somebody with you behind you to keep an eye out not a bad idea
YOU1000000001_S0000059	that looks good right about there so at this point i am going to get out and do a couple of the checks that i like to do just to make sure i have got enough room
YOU1000000001_S0000060	now we know we have got our stump here so i am going to do my arm check we have got plenty of room there
YOU1000000001_S0000061	i am right off my electrical box my electrical cord is going to be here so i am within my 25 feet here i think this looks like a great spot
YOU1000000001_S0000062	i am going to run the slide out out and put check the levels on the front of the camper and see if we are level and then we are going to take it from there
YOU1000000001_S0000063	so in a nutshell a lot of people get intimidated by this it is a really simple process do not care about anybody watching me i am just focused on what i am doing
YOU1000000001_S0000064	it does take a little bit of practice you are not going to hit the mark on the 1st time out but the more and more you do it and the less you worry about other people watching you the easier it is going to be for you
YOU1000000001_S0000065	so just follow my quick steps make sure you watch your wheels watch your mirrors
YOU1000000001_S0000066	if you can not get the camper exactly where you want unhook the truck and re situate the truck and the next time you will be right on the site right where you want it
YOU1000000001_S0000067	so thanks again for watching pete is rv tv with randy today
YOU1000000001_S0000068	new segment here for you hopefully this will help make your camping a little bit easier check out our other videos check out our youtube channel as well as our facebook page we have always got a great information on there as well
YOU1000000001_S0000069	so thanks again for watching pete is rv and happy camping
YOU1000000003_S0000001	this is a 3 it is sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28 x 28 pixels
YOU1000000003_S0000002	but your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a 3
YOU1000000003_S0000003	and i want you to take a moment to appreciate how crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly
YOU1000000003_S0000004	i mean this this and this are also recognizable as 3s
YOU1000000003_S0000005	even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next
YOU1000000003_S0000006	the particular light sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see these 3 are very different from the ones firing when you see these 3
YOU1000000003_S0000007	but something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea
YOU1000000003_S0000008	while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas
YOU1000000003_S0000009	but if i told you hey sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of 28 x 28 pixels like this
YOU1000000003_S0000010	and outputs a single number between 0 and 10 telling you what it thinks the digit is
YOU1000000003_S0000011	while the test goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult
YOU1000000003_S0000012	unless you have been living under a rock i think i hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks
YOU1000000003_S0000013	to the present and to the future but what i want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is
YOU1000000003_S0000014	assuming no background and to help visualize what it is doing not as a buzzword but as a piece of math
YOU1000000003_S0000015	my hope is just that you come away feeling like the structure itself is motivated
YOU1000000003_S0000016	and to feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network quote unquote learning
YOU1000000003_S0000017	this video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that and the following one is going to tackle learning
YOU1000000003_S0000018	what we are going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits
YOU1000000003_S0000020	this is a somewhat classic example for introducing the topic
YOU1000000003_S0000021	and i am happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the 2 videos i want to point you to a couple good resources where you can learn more
YOU1000000003_S0000022	and where you can download the code that does this and play with it on your own computer
YOU1000000003_S0000024	there are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years there has been sort of a boom in research towards these variants
YOU1000000003_S0000025	but in these 2 introductory videos you and i are just going to look at the simplest plain vanilla form with no added frills
YOU1000000003_S0000026	this is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants
YOU1000000003_S0000027	and trust me it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around
YOU1000000003_S0000028	but even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits
YOU1000000003_S0000029	which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do
YOU1000000003_S0000031	and at the same time you will see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it
YOU1000000003_S0000033	as the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain but let us break that down what are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together
YOU1000000003_S0000034	right now when i say neuron all i want you to think about is a thing that holds a number specifically a number between 0 and one it is really not more than that
YOU1000000003_S0000036	for example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image
YOU1000000003_S0000037	which is 784 neurons in total each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel
YOU1000000003_S0000038	ranging from 0 for black pixels up to one for white pixels this number inside the neuron is called its activation
YOU1000000003_S0000039	and the image you might have in mind here is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number
YOU1000000003_S0000041	so all of these 784 neurons make up the 1st layer of our network
YOU1000000003_S0000043	now jumping over to the last layer this has 10 neurons each representing one of the digits
YOU1000000003_S0000044	the activation in these neurons again some number that is between 0 and one
YOU1000000003_S0000045	represents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with a given digit
YOU1000000003_S0000046	there is also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers which for the time being should just be a giant question mark
YOU1000000003_S0000047	for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled in this network i chose 2 hidden layers each one with 16 neurons
YOU1000000003_S0000048	and admittedly that is kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest i chose 2 layers based on how i want to motivate the structure in just a moment
YOU1000000003_S0000049	and 16 well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice there is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here
YOU1000000003_S0000050	the way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer
YOU1000000003_S0000051	and of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer
YOU1000000003_S0000052	it is meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire
YOU1000000003_S0000053	the network i am showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what i mean by that
YOU1000000003_S0000054	it means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image
YOU1000000003_S0000055	that pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer which causes some pattern in the one after it
YOU1000000003_S0000056	which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and the brightest neuron of that output layer is the network is choice so to speak for what digit this image represents
YOU1000000003_S0000058	and before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works
YOU1000000003_S0000059	let us just talk about why it is even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently
YOU1000000003_S0000060	what are we expecting here what is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing
YOU1000000003_S0000061	well when you or i recognize digits we piece together various components a 9 has a loop up top and a line on the right
YOU1000000003_S0000062	an 8 also has a loop up top but it is paired with another loop down low
YOU1000000003_S0000063	a 4 basically breaks down into 3 specific lines and things like that
YOU1000000003_S0000064	in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the 2nd to last layer corresponds with one of these subcomponents
YOU1000000003_S0000065	that anytime you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a 9 or an 8 there is some specific neuron whose activation is going to be close to one
YOU1000000003_S0000066	and i do not mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron
YOU1000000003_S0000067	that way going from the 3rd layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of subcomponents corresponds to which digits
YOU1000000003_S0000068	of course that just kicks the problem down the road because how would you recognize these subcomponents or even learn what the right subcomponents should be
YOU1000000003_S0000069	and i still have not even talked about how one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems
YOU1000000003_S0000070	one reasonable way to do this would be to 1st recognize the various little edges that make it up
YOU1000000003_S0000071	similarly a long line like the kind you might see in the digits one 4 or 7 is really just a long edge or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges
YOU1000000003_S0000072	so maybe our hope is that each neuron in the 2nd layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges
YOU1000000003_S0000073	maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all the neurons associated with around 8 10 specific little edges
YOU1000000003_S0000074	which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and those light up the neuron associated with the 9
YOU1000000003_S0000075	whether or not this is what our final network actually does is another question one that i will come back to once we see how to train the network
YOU1000000003_S0000076	but this is a hope that we might have a sort of goal with the layered structure like this
YOU1000000003_S0000077	moreover you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks
YOU1000000003_S0000078	and even beyond image recognition there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction
YOU1000000003_S0000079	parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables
YOU1000000003_S0000080	which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts etc
YOU1000000003_S0000081	but getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing how exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next
YOU1000000003_S0000082	the goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges or edges into patterns or patterns into digits
YOU1000000003_S0000083	and to zoom in on one very specific example let us say the hope is for one particular neuron in the 2nd layer
YOU1000000003_S0000084	to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here
YOU1000000003_S0000085	the question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs should you be able to tweak
YOU1000000003_S0000086	so that it is expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things
YOU1000000003_S0000087	what we will do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the 1st layer
YOU1000000003_S0000088	these weights are just numbers then take all of those activations from the 1st layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights
YOU1000000003_S0000090	i find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own and i am going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights
YOU1000000003_S0000091	where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weight is value
YOU1000000003_S0000092	if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels 0 except for some positive weights in this region we care about
YOU1000000003_S0000093	then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about
YOU1000000003_S0000095	and if you really wanted to pick up on whether there is an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels
YOU1000000003_S0000096	then the sum is largest when the middle pixels are bright but the surrounding pixels are darker
YOU1000000003_S0000098	when you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 and one
YOU1000000003_S0000099	so a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 and one
YOU1000000003_S0000100	a common function that does this is called the sigmoid function also known as a logistic curve
YOU1000000003_S0000101	basically very negative inputs end up close to 0 very positive inputs end up close to one and it just steadily increases around the input 0
YOU1000000003_S0000103	so the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is
YOU1000000003_S0000105	but maybe it is not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0 maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10
YOU1000000003_S0000106	that is you want some bias for it to be inactive
YOU1000000003_S0000107	we will then add in some other number like -10 to this weighted sum before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function
YOU1000000003_S0000108	that additional number is called the bias
YOU1000000003_S0000109	the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the 2nd layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be
YOU1000000003_S0000110	before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active
YOU1000000003_S0000111	that is just one neuron every other neuron in this layer is connected to all 784 pixel neurons from the 1st layer
YOU1000000003_S0000112	and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it
YOU1000000003_S0000113	also each one has some bias some other number you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid
YOU1000000003_S0000114	and that is a lot to think about
YOU1000000003_S0000115	with this hidden layer of 16 neurons that is a total of 784 times 16 weights along with 16 biases
YOU1000000003_S0000116	and all of that is just the connections from the 1st layer to the 2nd the connections between the other layers also have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them
YOU1000000003_S0000117	all said and done this network has almost exactly 13000 total weights and biases
YOU1000000003_S0000118	13000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways
YOU1000000003_S0000120	so when we talk about learning what that is referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it will actually solve the problem at hand
YOU1000000003_S0000122	one thought experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand
YOU1000000003_S0000123	purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the 2nd layer picks up on edges the 3rd layer picks up on patterns etc
YOU1000000003_S0000124	i personally find this satisfying rather than just treating the network as a total black box
YOU1000000003_S0000125	because when the network does not perform the way you anticipate
YOU1000000003_S0000126	if you have built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for experimenting with how to change the structure to improve
YOU1000000003_S0000127	or when the network does work but not for the reasons you might expect digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions
YOU1000000003_S0000128	and really expose the full space of possible solutions
YOU1000000003_S0000129	by the way the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down do not you think
YOU1000000003_S0000131	so let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented this is how you would see it if you choose to read up more about neural networks
YOU1000000003_S0000132	organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector
YOU1000000003_S0000134	then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer
YOU1000000003_S0000135	what that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the 1st layer according to these weights
YOU1000000003_S0000136	corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here
YOU1000000003_S0000138	by the way so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra
YOU1000000003_S0000139	so for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series i did on linear algebra especially chapter 3
YOU1000000003_S0000140	back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently
YOU1000000003_S0000141	we represent it by organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product
YOU1000000003_S0000142	then as a final step i will wrap a sigmoid around the outside here
YOU1000000003_S0000143	and what that is supposed to represent is that you are going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside
YOU1000000003_S0000144	so once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next
YOU1000000003_S0000145	in an extremely tight and neat little expression
YOU1000000003_S0000146	and this makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication
YOU1000000003_S0000148	remember how earlier i said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in
YOU1000000003_S0000150	so it is actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between 0 and one
YOU1000000003_S0000151	really the entire network is just a function one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out 10 numbers as an output
YOU1000000003_S0000152	it is an absurdly complicated function one that involves 13000 parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns
YOU1000000003_S0000153	and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squishification function
YOU1000000003_S0000154	but it is just a function nonetheless and in a way it is kind of reassuring that it looks complicated
YOU1000000003_S0000155	i mean if it were any simpler what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits and how does it take on that challenge
YOU1000000003_S0000156	how does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data well that is what i will show in the next video
YOU1000000003_S0000157	i will also dig a little more into what this particular network we are seeing is really doing
YOU1000000003_S0000159	now is the point i suppose i should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out
YOU1000000003_S0000160	but realistically most of you do not actually receive notifications from youtube do you
YOU1000000003_S0000161	maybe more honestly i should say subscribe so that the neural networks that underlie youtube is recommendation algorithm
YOU1000000003_S0000162	are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you anyway stay posted for more
YOU1000000003_S0000163	thank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on patreon
YOU1000000003_S0000164	i have been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer but i am jumping back into it after this project so patrons you can look out for updates there
YOU1000000003_S0000166	to close things off here i have with me lisha lee who did her phd work on the theoretical side of deep learning
YOU1000000003_S0000167	and who currently works at a venture capital firm called amplify partners who kindly provided some of the funding for this video
YOU1000000003_S0000168	so leisha one thing i think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function
YOU1000000003_S0000169	as i understand it early networks used this to squish the relevant weighted sum into that interval between 0 and one
YOU1000000003_S0000170	you know kind of motivated by this biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active
YOU1000000003_S0000171	exactly
YOU1000000003_S0000172	but relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore it is kind of old school right
YOU1000000003_S0000173	yeah or rather relu seems to be much easier to train
YOU1000000003_S0000174	and relu stands for rectified linear unit
YOU1000000003_S0000175	yes it is this kind of function where you are just taking a max of 0 and
YOU1000000003_S0000176	and a where a is given by what you were explaining in the video
YOU1000000003_S0000177	and what this was sort of motivated from i think was partially by a biological analogy with how neurons would either be activated
YOU1000000003_S0000178	or not and so if it passes a certain threshold it would be the identity function but if it did not then it would just not be activated so it would be 0 so it is kind of a simplification
YOU1000000003_S0000179	using sigmoids did not help training or it was very difficult to train at some and people just tried relu
YOU1000000003_S0000180	and it happened to work very well for these incredibly deep neural networks
YOU1000000003_S0000181	all right thank you leisha

YOU1000000005_S0000000	hey you all my name is kori ashton and i know that you have been working really hard to try to figure out
YOU1000000005_S0000001	how to track all of those different points of advertisement that are bringing traffic to your wordpress website right
YOU1000000005_S0000002	you have been looking and thinking okay that email campaign that i did i can see that it was open at this rate
YOU1000000005_S0000003	and i can see even which users opened them and i can even see how many clicked on something
YOU1000000005_S0000004	but how do i know which one of those actually drew in the cell at the end of the day right
YOU1000000005_S0000005	how do we follow the buyer is journey all the way through our website and know which facebook campaign actually converted better how are you tracking those things
YOU1000000005_S0000006	well there is actually a free tool that you can use to do it i am going to show you how to do it all right now
YOU1000000005_S0000008	hey you guys this is brought to you by liquid web the most helpful humans in hosting if you need help with your wordpress website will you please reach out to them

YOU1000000005_S0000011	alright let us get to the tutorial it is time to learn about utm codes so if you have ever seen a url path that looks like this
YOU1000000005_S0000012	this has utm tracking inside of it
YOU1000000005_S0000013	utm is urgent tracking module you have also probably heard it called tracking parameters or tracking tags
YOU1000000005_S0000014	these utm tags allow us to track 5 different things i am going to walk you through what those look like
YOU1000000005_S0000015	but let us break down this url 1st so you kind of understand what you are looking at
YOU1000000005_S0000016	obviously this right here is the root domain name or the page that you want this link to go to
YOU1000000005_S0000017	then you have got a utm source living inside of here this is the 1st parameter that we are using
YOU1000000005_S0000018	we are asking for the source of this particular link traffic right
YOU1000000005_S0000019	where did my traffic come from where is the source of this traffic where were we using this link
YOU1000000005_S0000020	this says newsletter you can track all sorts of stuff here is another utm parameter saying the utm medium is the email
YOU1000000005_S0000021	the utm campaign is the seo tips and the utm content is the call to action button you have got 5 different parameters that you can track
YOU1000000005_S0000022	those 5 different parameters are campaign source campaign medium campaign name campaign term
YOU1000000005_S0000023	and campaign content now this particular resource that i am giving you is actually the free resource that helps you build those urls
YOU1000000005_S0000024	easily and quickly they type it all in for you and make certain that you do not miss any characters whatsoever all you have to do is answer the questions and fill in the blanks here
YOU1000000005_S0000025	and it will start to build it for you so let me walk you through 1st of all what they are and then i will build a sample url so the campaign source
YOU1000000005_S0000026	this is required if we are going to use any utms this is the base one that will be required the medium is required and the campaign name
YOU1000000005_S0000027	and then the term and the content would be optional but the campaign source is used to identify the search engine
YOU1000000005_S0000028	newsletter name or other source example google right so we are going to do an example up here using facebook the campaign medium
YOU1000000005_S0000029	this is the utm medium used to identify the email or maybe the cost per click
YOU1000000005_S0000030	whatever medium is being used inside of that source so for us it is just going to be a regular post that we are going to do right
YOU1000000005_S0000031	and then this is also the one that is required the utm campaign this is used to identify a specific product or promotion or strategic campaign
YOU1000000005_S0000032	so the example that they are giving here is spring sell so you can use something if you are running a certain campaign for donations
YOU1000000005_S0000033	or for a particular product that you want to highlight
YOU1000000005_S0000034	the campaign term would be to note a keyword for this ad so if you are trying to go after a specific key term you can add that inside of there
YOU1000000005_S0000035	and then the campaign content i think this one is really key to use as well
YOU1000000005_S0000036	because this one allows you to differentiate between ads or links if they are in the same type of document
YOU1000000005_S0000037	so for like an email campaign if you have different links
YOU1000000005_S0000038	you can track the specific link inside that document that brought you the most traffic so it is a really cool tool here
YOU1000000005_S0000039	let us go up here and build one out and i will show you how to use it so website url this is the link that you want them to land on so if you have an internal landing page
YOU1000000005_S0000040	this can go anywhere to a active link online the campaign source for us right now i am going to go ahead and use facebook
YOU1000000005_S0000042	the campaign medium so this is cost per click banner email you can put whatever you want to inside of there i am actually going to list the facebook page
YOU1000000005_S0000043	i am going to put this on so i can track whichever page this is coming from so i am going to say this is coming from ask cori page
YOU1000000005_S0000045	then the campaign name remember these are the required 3 fields that you have to have after your url
YOU1000000005_S0000046	so we have got to fill it out and put something in there that makes sense for us is this a product is this a promo code is there a slogan
YOU1000000005_S0000047	and what do we need to put in here to help us again better understand where this traffic is coming from i am going to put on here seo tips
YOU1000000005_S0000049	and then you can add in keywords and you can add in campaign content if you want to differentiate those ads
YOU1000000005_S0000050	and for this one i am going to go ahead and say that this one was an organic ad that basically i did not promote
YOU1000000005_S0000051	this is just an organic ad that i was just going to post on my facebook page that is it you guys it has built out the link for me
YOU1000000005_S0000052	now here is the cool part we can take that link and use it like a regular link anywhere you want anywhere
YOU1000000005_S0000053	on any social network inside of twitter whatever we wanted if we need to have a shorter link you can do that
YOU1000000005_S0000054	but you do have to have authorization required so basically you just need to log in create an account
YOU1000000005_S0000055	but for free we can grab this link right here and we are off and running we can put that behind a text link behind an image
YOU1000000005_S0000056	we can put it in a post it does not matter we can use it anywhere we want and it allows us to completely track where that traffic came from
YOU1000000005_S0000057	so let us take that link and jump into our facebook here i am inside of my facebook page for corey ashley
YOU1000000005_S0000058	you can come down here and just like you would in adding in any other regular link you would be adding it here
YOU1000000005_S0000059	and then you say something like check out my toolbox for really great seo tools
YOU1000000005_S0000060	and tips and i am pasting in that url
YOU1000000005_S0000062	yes it looks lengthy and that is fine people are still going to click on it it is no big deal but look it is going to render it just like it normally would it brought over everything brought over my image brought over the snippet

YOU1000000010_S0000005	and what they are doing is sharing out the live stream to other social media platforms so sharing it to their facebook group or to a page or to any other social media
YOU1000000010_S0000006	the time to capture your audience when you are running a live stream is immediately
YOU1000000010_S0000007	you do not want to have to make your audience wait just wait a minute while i share this out to my page to my group to my twitter account you need to capture your audience straight away
YOU1000000010_S0000008	well now there is a way to automate this process so that you are not losing those precious 1st seconds from your true fans that jump on immediately when you are live
YOU1000000010_S0000009	in this video i am going to show you the tool you need to do it and take you through step by step how you can set it up for maximum results across multiple platforms
YOU1000000010_S0000010	and stick around to the end because i am also going to share with you another tool that we use to help notify our subscribers long before our live streams even start

YOU1000000010_S0000017	there is no other way to automatically syndicate your facebook live out across all of these different platforms but even internally just in facebook
YOU1000000010_S0000018	to share it out automatically to a facebook group a page or multiple groups or multiple pages the instant you go live is really really powerful

YOU1000000010_S0000020	so you can try it for 7 days for one and again check out the links in the description below so once you have created your liveleap account you will need to sign in using your facebook account
YOU1000000010_S0000021	once you are in this is what you are presented with this is the live leap dashboard

YOU1000000010_S0000023	but the next one down facebook route manager is where the magic happens and this is where you can set up routes or where you want your facebook lives to be syndicated out to
YOU1000000010_S0000024	so we will create a new rule here a new route so this page is the 1st step here in this 5 step setup process

YOU1000000010_S0000030	now if you only want to share your live videos out and syndicate them from your personal profile then that is all you will need to pick
YOU1000000010_S0000031	if you want to syndicate out when you go live to a page that you are an admin on or a manager on as well then you can pick those pages here
YOU1000000010_S0000032	so i will syndicate out our live streams from our primal video facebook page as well so i will select that one and choose next
YOU1000000010_S0000034	now share to these pages and groups where do we want these to go do you want to share live videos to your personal profile
YOU1000000010_S0000035	so if we turn this on even though we already had our personal profile ticked on the page before
YOU1000000010_S0000036	this means that if we go live on either our personal profile or the page they will be syndicated to the other as well and likewise
YOU1000000010_S0000037	what pages would we like to syndicate our facebook live to
YOU1000000010_S0000039	justin brown primal video we will send it there as well when we go live so that way if we are live on our personal profile it is going to go to the page if we are live on the page it is going to go to the profile
YOU1000000010_S0000040	so you can already see the level of control you get over this syndication you can pick multiple pages if you need to to really share your live streams out
YOU1000000010_S0000041	and here you can also choose which groups you want to share your live videos to
YOU1000000010_S0000042	so if you are an admin on a group or a group owner then you will have the choice to pick your groups down the bottom here
YOU1000000010_S0000043	and we go next next up we can select networks outside of facebook that we want to broadcast and syndicate our facebook lives to
YOU1000000010_S0000044	so you can see we have got twitter and linkedin here you need to connect your account 1st by clicking the click here to connect your account on both twitter and linkedin if you want
YOU1000000010_S0000045	you can see i have already got my twitter linked up justinbrownpv if i want to broadcast to there then i will enable that here
YOU1000000010_S0000046	and exactly the same for linkedin you will have to connect your account if you want to broadcast to linkedin as well then hit next
YOU1000000010_S0000047	now this is where it gets really interesting and something that you do not see too often you can actually share your facebook live broadcast out via sms
YOU1000000010_S0000048	so you can upload a csv file with your sms contacts or an email list
YOU1000000010_S0000049	so you can upload your email address list into this area as well and if we just click on that now you can see that it is looking for a csv file
YOU1000000010_S0000051	so we will skip that one for now and the last integrations you get here you can send live notifications to websites and multiple websites
YOU1000000010_S0000052	so we can click here and add a website you will go through name your website give all your links you can set what the notification is going to look like
YOU1000000010_S0000053	then you paste this code into your website so whenever you are live there is a notification that pops up on your website
YOU1000000010_S0000054	saying that you are live as well so that is really powerful so you can see here that i have got this set up on our primalvideo com website so i can enable that here now too
YOU1000000010_S0000055	and the last one here is webhook integration so if you have got any webhooks that are set up for any services or any other platforms that you are running
YOU1000000010_S0000056	then you can set those up in here as well and once you have got all of that set up just click finish and that is it it is really that simple
YOU1000000010_S0000057	now it is set up so anytime i go live on either my personal profile or a facebook page you can see here share from personal profile
YOU1000000010_S0000058	or one facebook page which was the primal video facebook page it is going to share to personal it is going to share to that facebook primal video page
YOU1000000010_S0000059	it is also going to share to my twitter and to our primal video website as well
YOU1000000010_S0000060	now you can have multiple pages multiple groups multiple twitter accounts and multiple websites in here as well the only thing you can not have multiples of is personal accounts
YOU1000000010_S0000061	your livelip account is linked here to your personal facebook profile so at this point you can not broadcast to multiple profiles
YOU1000000010_S0000062	but really who has multiple profiles anyway and even more advanced than this is you can create multiple routes you can see we have just got one here
YOU1000000010_S0000063	we can have multiple routes to broadcast different things out to different platforms and different areas so it is really powerful
YOU1000000010_S0000064	the only other settings you have got in here are advanced settings for email and for text and sms settings as well
YOU1000000010_S0000065	so you can see here you can link it up to your sendgrid account through a sendgrid api and that would be how it is sending the emails out and more advanced settings for your sms broadcast as well
YOU1000000010_S0000066	but if you are not worried about sms or email then you can ignore these altogether the key area that you want to set up here is the facebook route manager
YOU1000000010_S0000067	now the last thing that you are probably wondering is this sounds amazing how much does it actually cost i know i can get a 7 day trial for a dollar but how much does it cost to keep using it
YOU1000000010_S0000068	well there is 2 plans there is a basic plan at $19 per month which is going to do what most people would be after and there is a pro plan at $49 per month
YOU1000000010_S0000069	the main difference between the 2 plans is the number of users you can have you have got one user on the basic plan and 3 users on the pro plan
YOU1000000010_S0000070	you will have more advanced training on the pro plan as well and it has got alpha access to page builder
YOU1000000010_S0000071	and it says that page builder automatically creates video replay pages and has a variety of features for marketing
YOU1000000010_S0000072	so if you are interested in that then the pro plan is for you if not at least start out with the basic $19 per month and that will do most things that you are after
YOU1000000010_S0000073	but grab the $17 day trial and see how this works for you
YOU1000000010_S0000074	but i can guarantee you you will not be disappointed this is really a game changing service that is going to change the way people create their facebook lives
YOU1000000010_S0000075	so that is how you can set up the automatic syndication of your facebook lives
YOU1000000010_S0000076	to go out to multiple facebook groups multiple facebook pages multiple platforms twitter linkedin your website all using liveleap
YOU1000000010_S0000077	now the other tool that i mentioned earlier in the video that we use to notify our subscribers our fans our followers
YOU1000000010_S0000078	that we are going to go live before we are actually live is called send calendar
YOU1000000010_S0000079	the best way to get people in and attending your facebook lives is to give them as much notice as you can and that is what send calendar allows you to do
YOU1000000010_S0000080	it allows you to get your live streams into their calendar so that is their calendar on their phone on their computer
YOU1000000010_S0000081	that is their business calendar that they are using every day to schedule their everyday lives
YOU1000000010_S0000082	if you can get your live streams into there then it is highly likely they will show up and attend your live stream
YOU1000000010_S0000083	we did do a video on send calendar a little while back and i will link it up in the cards now so make sure you check it out
YOU1000000010_S0000084	if you want to see how powerful it is getting your live streams into your audience is calendars

YOU1000000015_S0000003	you can find linked in the description box below so let us jump into it now if you have got videos on facebook including your facebook live streams that you would like to download
YOU1000000015_S0000004	and repurpose from your iphone or ipad unfortunately the process is not as straightforward as it can be but the good news is there are a few options to do it
YOU1000000015_S0000005	and we are going to run through the best ones right now now each option does have its own advantages and disadvantages so stick around to make sure that you are using the best option for you
YOU1000000015_S0000006	so the 1st option i am going to take you through is solely going to use your iphone or your ipad with no need to use a computer or a laptop
YOU1000000015_S0000007	to be able to help in the process okay so the 1st step is to open up facebook and to go and find the videos that you want to download
YOU1000000015_S0000008	so for this i am just going to go to our primal video page
YOU1000000015_S0000009	and i will come across here to videos find the video that i want to download let us say this one here it is not too late to grow on youtube let us press on that
YOU1000000015_S0000010	and then we need to grab the link for that video so we come down to share as if we are going to share this out come down to more options and you want to choose copy
YOU1000000015_S0000011	so that we are copying the link to that video next you will need to come across to the app store and make sure that you have firefox installed
YOU1000000015_S0000012	so firefox is an alternative web browser to google chrome or safari but the biggest difference is that firefox will let you download these videos
YOU1000000015_S0000013	from that video link so you can see i have already got it installed so i am just going to hit open on this and firefox is totally free and it is safe to download and install and have on your device
YOU1000000015_S0000014	so the next thing i want to do is to open up firefox and head over to one of these 2 websites
YOU1000000015_S0000015	either fbdownload io or fbdown net currently these are the 2 most popular ones and either one of them is going to give you great results
YOU1000000015_S0000016	my personal preference is fbdownload io so i am going to head there now and all we need to do is to paste that link that we have just copied into this text field here
YOU1000000015_S0000017	so we press and hold and then hit paste there is our video link that we had copied we press download and we wait a few seconds
YOU1000000015_S0000018	as it is generating our download links please wait and as we scroll down here you can see all the different options we have got for downloading our videos
YOU1000000015_S0000019	we get the choice of whether we want the hd version an sd version or one of the lower quality versions or even audio only so it is normally going to be the top one that you will want that is normally the best quality
YOU1000000015_S0000020	and you can see the file size there 16.69 meg is much higher than a lot of the other ones there so that is the one that we want we just press and hold on that download button
YOU1000000015_S0000022	and then we get the option here to download link so if we press on download link we then get the option here to download the file so we press download now
YOU1000000015_S0000023	that is going to go through and that is going to download that file okay so you can see the file is finished downloading now so if we press on downloads so what you want to do is press on that because it is currently not going to show up
YOU1000000015_S0000024	in our camera roll or in our gallery so we want to press on that and then we want to choose save video and that is now going to save it across into our photos
YOU1000000015_S0000025	so we can come back here to photos and you will see that that video is in there now
YOU1000000015_S0000026	so that is option one and you can see how easy it is to download your videos directly into your ipad or into your iphone just using that firefox app
YOU1000000015_S0000027	now this will only work for videos that are public on facebook
YOU1000000015_S0000028	if they are inside of a closed or private group then this option may not work or if the privacy is set to not be public then this is not going to work either
YOU1000000015_S0000029	now while this method does let you download a decent quality version of that video from facebook it is not the best quality that you can get
YOU1000000015_S0000030	in order to get the best quality videos downloaded from facebook you are going to want to use your mac or your pc and you want to download the file on there
YOU1000000015_S0000031	and then transfer it across to your iphone or ipad i am going to show you this method now now the best tool that i have found to do this is called parallels toolbox
YOU1000000015_S0000032	and it is available for both mac and windows does cost $19.99 for the year for a subscription to this software but is so much more
YOU1000000015_S0000033	than just video downloading software so if i bring it up now you can see you have got options for do not disturb mode presentation mode you have got the ability to hide your desktop
YOU1000000015_S0000034	if you are going to be doing a screen share or a screen recording you can remove all the clutter and mess on your desktop to make it look cleaner you have got an airplane mode you have got options in here to clean up your hard drive
YOU1000000015_S0000035	if you have got a video converter in here an animated gif or gif maker there is a heap of tools in here and these guys are actively adding new ones
YOU1000000015_S0000036	in here all the time but the one that we are talking about here is the download video tool and this is what pops up when you open it so what you want to do 1st is just check that your settings are set accordingly
YOU1000000015_S0000037	accordingly you can see here you can choose the preferred quality i would recommend that you are going to leave it on max or maximum available but you can also select lower quality versions as well
YOU1000000015_S0000038	as well if you are downloading a non mp 4 video so a video that is in a different file format you can have it
YOU1000000015_S0000039	download and convert into an mp 4 all within this app as well so for us we are going to download without conversion
YOU1000000015_S0000040	you also get to specify your download location so here i am on a mac it is just going to go to downloads we will hit done and i will show you how this works
YOU1000000015_S0000041	so we want to come across to that same facebook page our facebook page let us pick the same video it is not too late to grow on youtube we will select that
YOU1000000015_S0000042	let us pause it so it does not play now what we need to do here is to grab that link again so here we do not need to hit share it is actually at the top here the url we can just copy that
YOU1000000015_S0000043	or if you are not seeing that you can right click on any video and choose show video url and this is the link here so you want to select that right click and choose copy
YOU1000000015_S0000044	or press control c or command c to copy that link you then want to come back to parallels toolbox and then all we need to do is hit paste
YOU1000000015_S0000045	and that is going to download that video for us
YOU1000000015_S0000047	and you can see here the file size is a little bit larger at 17.5 megabytes so it is slightly better quality and you can see that your download is completed down here
YOU1000000015_S0000048	on your computer under downloads or wherever it is that you have set it to save so from there once you have got the file saved on your computer all you need to do is to transfer it
YOU1000000015_S0000049	over to your iphone or ipad we have got a video linked up in the cards showing you a few different methods on how you can do it but it really can be as easy as if you are on a mac
YOU1000000015_S0000050	and on an iphone just use airdrop and just send it to yourself wirelessly or you could do something like icloud google drive or dropbox
YOU1000000015_S0000051	to easily transfer that file to yourself so that is how easy it is to download your facebook videos onto your iphone or ipad
YOU1000000015_S0000052	now if you are interested in repurposing your video content across to other platforms and even converting some of your videos into a portrait format
YOU1000000015_S0000053	for places like igtv then check out the video linked on screen now for a full walkthrough on how to do it plus an overview of all the options available to you
YOU1000000015_S0000054	i will see you in the next one
YOU1000000019_S0000000	hey guys what is up it is jrcuber and in this video we are going to be talking about the valk 3 the 1st cube since 2010 to be named after a speedcuber
YOU1000000019_S0000001	the vision for the valk 3 was brought about by mats valk who is the former 3 x 3 single world record holder and the 3rd place winner of us nationals this year
YOU1000000019_S0000002	the cube was designed by chi mo fang yi and was approved by mats valk of course the cube is his main but let us see how the cube actually performs and whether it is right for you
YOU1000000019_S0000004	the vault 3 is on the pricier side of things it is about $20 and if you opt for the cubicle premium version like i did it is going to be $27
YOU1000000019_S0000005	the cube in this review will be the premium valk 3 and i have not changed the lube at all i have just tightened the tensions a little bit if you want to see how the premium valk 3 is prepared the link will be in the description
YOU1000000019_S0000006	if you want to check that out anyways moving on the valk 3 measures 55.5 millimeters across i kind of feel like that was planned a little bit
YOU1000000019_S0000007	but i guess we will never know for sure the stock stickers are labeled as the qi half bright shades but they are pretty much identical to q smith half brights
YOU1000000019_S0000008	which if you guys did not know were the shades that everyone used to use before the cubicle stickers became popular so let us talk about turning
YOU1000000019_S0000009	out of the box the valk 3 reminded me of a yu gi 0 a bit when i opened up the cubes to compare the mechanisms i was actually very surprised to see that they were almost identical seemingly
YOU1000000019_S0000010	even moyu posted some photos of the yu xiao and the valk 3 next to each other and the mechanisms look pretty much the same
YOU1000000019_S0000011	but she then went on to post some more photos and explain some more of the subtle differences between the 2 cubes
YOU1000000019_S0000012	and of course feeling a broken in yuxiao and a broken in volk 3 they are pretty much nothing alike the volk 3 is pretty much entirely smooth there are no bumps or anything along the turn
YOU1000000019_S0000013	it is just completely smooth it is also very light and very fast very little effort is required to start a turn so the cube is best suited for a light accurate turn style
YOU1000000019_S0000014	when turning fast the cube does become a bit clicky and has a very rigid feel in general the cube is easy to control on tight tensions but sometimes i do lose control and overshoot
YOU1000000019_S0000015	causing a lockup although this mostly happens when i am spamming tps in the last layer so i have had to learn to control my speed to help with overshooting
YOU1000000019_S0000016	and in general i have just had to adjust my turning style quite a bit to do well with this cube since i have been using the outlong v 2 as my main i would say i have adapted more of a harsher turn style
YOU1000000019_S0000017	as the l one v 2 is very forgiving but it is also not super fast so you can turn very rough and you will not lock up basically
YOU1000000019_S0000018	but if you use that turnstile with a valk it just locks up completely so i have had to work on adjusting my turnstile to be a bit slower a little bit more precise
YOU1000000019_S0000019	but with a bit of practice i have been able to get my times back down to what they usually are and i have pretty much stopped getting lockups the corner cutting on the valk is up to par with any modern speedcube
YOU1000000019_S0000020	although i did notice after tightening the tensions it was much harder to cut past 45 same with reverse but smaller cuts were just fine
YOU1000000019_S0000021	the cube however just feels a bit more rigid and sturdy than other 3 x 3 is which i really like it is a very stable puzzle it is just not as forgiving as some other 3 x 3 is
YOU1000000019_S0000022	popping and corner twisting of course never happen on this cube those are 2 things that really do not even need to be talked about in reviews anymore because pretty much all cubes have those traits
YOU1000000019_S0000023	overall the performance of the valk 3 is really really good but there are just a few things that bug me about it that i am just not a huge fan of 1st of all the size
YOU1000000019_S0000024	the 55.5 hmm is just a little too small for me i do prefer 57 hmm cubes mainly because my hands are really big
YOU1000000019_S0000025	and i actually found my fingers getting caught on the layers sometimes especially doing m turns i just noticed that to happen it is not that big of a deal though
YOU1000000019_S0000026	i am
YOU1000000019_S0000027	the cube just glides so effortlessly it is kind of hard to control sometimes this is another one that i have gotten used to over time and i am starting to actually enjoy now but i still thought i would bring it up
YOU1000000019_S0000028	finally the squared off corners now i say this in every review i do not really like squared off corners for me they just cause too much catching and i do not really corner twist either way
YOU1000000019_S0000029	so it is not really an advantage for me but this cube in particular i felt has a bigger catching issue
YOU1000000019_S0000030	i am not sure why but i noticed the corner catching on the center more often than with other squared off corner puzzles i just think that if the corners were rounded off all of the catching problems would pretty much disappear
YOU1000000019_S0000031	once again i have pretty much gotten used to it but i would still prefer if they were not there overall the valk 3 is an extremely solid cube
YOU1000000019_S0000032	the performance is really top of the line and my problems with it are really just minor annoyances the valk has huge potential in my opinion to be one of the best
YOU1000000019_S0000033	if not the best speedcubes you can buy and it honestly surprises me that i am saying that this cube has gotten me some new personal bests and it is getting closer and closer to beating my owlong
YOU1000000019_S0000034	i can not say for sure that i will make it my main as i still do have some mixed feelings about it but i think you should absolutely give this cube a shot if you have been on the fence about it
YOU1000000019_S0000035	and if you can afford it definitely get the premium version it is set up perfectly and i have not had any problems with it but anyway that is all i have got to say about the qiyi mofangyi valk 3
YOU1000000019_S0000036	if you want to purchase this cube the link will be in the description down below thanks to the cubicle for making this video possible if you guys like this video give it a like and if you have not already done so
YOU1000000019_S0000037	like my facebook page follow me on instagram and twitter and of course subscribe thanks for watching guys bye
YOU1000000021_S0000000	released by square enix in 2007 on the playstation portable director hajime tabata and writer kazushika nojima worked together to create a prequel to final fantasy vii for its 10th anniversary
YOU1000000021_S0000001	the game sets up the world and role of many characters from the main game and focuses on developing several figures such as zack aerith sephiroth and key members of shinra
YOU1000000021_S0000002	the story and gameplay are done solely from the perspective of zack and features full voice acting for combat random encounters are utilized while actual combat is similar to the kingdom hearts menu based real time system
YOU1000000021_S0000003	mechanics such as the equipment and materials system have been majorly overhauled and removed to reduce player macro management and instead contribute to the main battle modifier the digital mindwave
YOU1000000021_S0000004	the dmw is a continuously spinning slot machine system that confers various bonuses effects and attacks based on the results including how zack levels up
YOU1000000021_S0000005	the campaign is progressed through missions the player can select at their own pace or complete sidequests instead traveling instantly to many fully 3 d areas and dungeons with no need for an overworld map
YOU1000000021_S0000006	the story only gets larger from here so let us cut it down to size with a recapitation
YOU1000000021_S0000007	the game begins with zack fair soldier 2nd class of the group called soldier a private military army owned by the shinra electric power company in the city of midgar
YOU1000000021_S0000008	he completes a training exercise under the mentorship of his friend and commander angeal a 1st class soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000009	zack has tremendous skills and talent but is unfortunately a little overconfident and reckless at times as pointed out by his fellow soldier another 1st class named sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000010	zack idolizes sephiroth as a hero and aspires to one day be at his level but he is not ready yet despite this sephiroth only being part of the training simulation
YOU1000000021_S0000011	and jill helps him out reminding him to temper his aspirations with passionate dreams and steadfast honor
YOU1000000021_S0000012	zack hears from a fellow soldier of the mass desertion of troops in soldier and he is soon called in to speak with the director of soldier a man named lanzard
YOU1000000021_S0000013	he is briefed about soldier 1st class genesis who went missing during a mission in wutai an independent country to the west against whom shinra company is personally leveraging its military might
YOU1000000021_S0000014	zack gets to pick up the mission in his place as a test for soldier 1st class per angeal is recommended promotion
YOU1000000021_S0000015	angeal accompanies zack on this mission as they are to bring down the last bastion for wutai and shinra can complete its mission for economic world domination
YOU1000000021_S0000016	zack notes angeal is massive sword the buster sword is rarely used which angeal jokingly admits he is rather stingy with though does end up using it when his friend is in trouble
YOU1000000021_S0000017	during the mission he encounters ifrit and while he manages to just hold him off he is amazed to be rescued by his idol sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000018	investigating some fallen troops that do not belong to wutai it is revealed they bear identical faces to genesis the missing soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000019	suddenly angeal goes missing and sephiroth suspects he too has betrayed them and deserted though zack fervently denies it
YOU1000000021_S0000020	after the mission draculazard confirms angeal really is gone for unknown reasons but assigns zack on a new mission
YOU1000000021_S0000021	he is to investigate what happened with 2 missing agents that went in to check around genesis hometown
YOU1000000021_S0000022	in addition he assigns song of the turks shinra is elite operative and espionage unit to cooperate on this mission
YOU1000000021_S0000023	heading to banora village which was also in jill is hometown zack finds and feeds a few more genesis clones
YOU1000000021_S0000024	sung explains this technology was stolen from shinra which allowed genesis to implant his abilities and strength on other soldier members or monsters
YOU1000000021_S0000025	originally it was to clone their best soldiers to make up for the low numbers they currently have but zack is more keen to note that this infers that soldiers and monsters are fundamentally and biologically the same
YOU1000000021_S0000026	moving on song informs zack that angeal and genesis were childhood best friends that grew up together which is why sephiroth thinks they are in cahoots with their desertion
YOU1000000021_S0000027	finding angeal is mother jillian she notes zack is the restless puppy angeal often spoke about and she tells him genesis came by a month ago with an army of minions and proceeded to start killing townsfolk
YOU1000000021_S0000028	she also lets zack know angeal did come by here and left his prize sword behind which she explains represents his family is honor
YOU1000000021_S0000029	it turns out genesis killed his parents and zack makes a plea to be given a chance to talk with angeal and see about convincing him and genesis to come back
YOU1000000021_S0000030	sang sees now zack is passion as why sephiroth who was originally assigned this mission but refused chose zack to take his place
YOU1000000021_S0000031	he was actually counting on zack to bring back angeal and genesis his only friends in this world they discover genesis but he beats them back and angeal resurfaces
YOU1000000021_S0000032	zack discovers angeal standing over a dead julian and is simply confused by the entire situation
YOU1000000021_S0000033	summoning bahamut to distract and settle down a frustrated zack both genesis and angeal choose to turn their back on shinra while asking how long zack himself can stand living on that side
YOU1000000021_S0000034	afterwards genesis reveals they are all monsters quite literally as he unveils a single large black wing proclaiming this means they have no honor dreams anymore he flies off
YOU1000000021_S0000035	refusing to believe that soldier means monster zack is interrupted as general launches an air strike to wipe the town of banora off the map ensuring no witnesses to this event
YOU1000000021_S0000036	soon after shinra wins the war with wutai and has every city in the world under its thumb now
YOU1000000021_S0000037	time passes and zack is greeted by sephiroth personally as he is promoted to soldier 1st class officially though attaining this dream of his seems bittersweet
YOU1000000021_S0000038	however duty calls and he is assigned a new mission after suiting up in his new black uniform he is told a kill command has been issued for aangil genesis and their clone army
YOU1000000021_S0000039	unfortunately zack cannot be trusted due to his relationship to angeal and even sephiroth holds his own thoughts on the issue
YOU1000000021_S0000040	suddenly they are interrupted as the building is under attack and zack works alongside turks reno rude and sisne as they take out more genesis clones
YOU1000000021_S0000041	cysteine encounters genesis himself but is soon overwhelmed and zack rescues her and weathers his punishing assault in a one on one duel
YOU1000000021_S0000042	as he strikes down genesis he gets a call from sephiroth who is located angeal
YOU1000000021_S0000043	he tells zack to hurry over before the shinra army arrives so they can help their mutual friend escape and zack is happy to help
YOU1000000021_S0000044	however when he arrives and destroys a new monster he is shocked to see a bear is and jill is face on it
YOU1000000021_S0000045	as sephiroth talks more with zack he elaborates more how angeal genesis and himself were close friends and even though sephiroth himself was the company is prized war hero genesis himself wanted such prestige as well
YOU1000000021_S0000046	even when they would train in the company is training room sephiroth could hold his own against both angeal and genesis though when genesis got serious not even his friend angeal could calm him down
YOU1000000021_S0000047	even then sephiroth was the better fighter once injuring genesis is prime even more than his blade
YOU1000000021_S0000048	surveying the monster sephiroth deduces the duo are in league with doctor hollander which ties into the story he just told
YOU1000000021_S0000049	at one time the small wound sephiroth dealt was not healing for some reason and the doctor treating him was doctor hollander
YOU1000000021_S0000050	he explains that some mako energy infected the room when it was dealt and angeal would have to be the donor in a transfusion
YOU1000000021_S0000051	sephiroth immediately questions why he was immediately rejected as a donor but got no answer
YOU1000000021_S0000052	rather he learned that hollander was conducting an experiment on a soldier type g in which monsters were to be made but one failed experiment actually produced genesis as a result
YOU1000000021_S0000053	however such an existence has proved to have side effects such as his body rapidly degrading and the curious ability to make copies of himself
YOU1000000021_S0000054	hollander himself appears surprised to see them but explains only he can stop genesis degradation after which genesis himself appears and explains hollander will not be captured
YOU1000000021_S0000055	genesis likens their situation to his favorite play loveless and wonders which of the 3 friends would be the hero to which he still envies sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000056	meanwhile zack pursues hollander but angeal himself interjects and shows him he too has become a monster with his own set of wings
YOU1000000021_S0000057	zack refuses to fight against angeal who is frustrated as his reality of being a monster is clashing with his principles and dreams and zack is sent tumbling down
YOU1000000021_S0000058	when he comes to zack is in a church in the slums where he is awoken up by aerith a young woman living there he is immediately smitten with aerith asking her out on a date but getting quickly turned down
YOU1000000021_S0000059	he is impressed by the rare sight of flowers in midgar suggesting she sell them and not only liven up midgar with flowers but also make a lot of money on the side
YOU1000000021_S0000060	she still ends up spending the day with zack as at her favorite shop zack insists on getting her her choice of a gift resulting in aerith picking out a large pink hair ribbon
YOU1000000021_S0000061	she loves the gift promising to wear it always though as their not officially a date date continues she questions the normalcy of members of soldiers as rumor goes they receive some sort of special surgery that turns them beyond human
YOU1000000021_S0000062	she admits their lust for battle also makes them a bit frightening and zack chooses this time to confess he is with soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000063	she is naturally surprised and actually likes his unique eyes to which zack continues to flirt showing off the trademark mako infused eyes of a soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000064	zack gets called back to shinra but succeeded in leaving a good impression on aerith and they agree to see each other again en route back to shinra angeal stops zack again this time more willing to talk
YOU1000000021_S0000065	he asks for zack is help as he is slowly losing his mind and not only wants to keep his honor but also wants zack to help him defeat their enemies that are causing so much suffering
YOU1000000021_S0000066	zack agrees but is swept away before he can ask further questions he is delivered to sephiroth who is also helping angeal as they fight genesis whom they suspect is being used by hallender to kill another notorious scientist within shinra hojo
YOU1000000021_S0000067	meanwhile hojo sees through the power play when genesis arrives though zack and angeal are soon to arrive as well genesis retreats but not before summoning bahamut fury for zack to deal with
YOU1000000021_S0000069	later zack goes to visit aerith when tseng halts him to call him into a mission to mordeoheim and gives zack pause when he says he also knows aerith but will not elaborate
YOU1000000021_S0000070	genesis forces shoot down their helicopter though zack song and a couple of common shinra infantrymen manage to survive
YOU1000000021_S0000071	they joke that zack is a country boy from the sticks so this harsh terrain will not bother him though it turns out one of the grunts is as well
YOU1000000021_S0000072	zack is from the tiny village of gongaga and this village is from nibelheim who introduces himself as cloud
YOU1000000021_S0000073	as the mission for hollander continues genesis moves to kill him as he is already begun visibly degrading and claims he does not need hollander anymore
YOU1000000021_S0000074	zack saves hollander who beats away cloud while trying to restrain him and zack duels once more with genesis proving he is a match against the degrading ace who is severely weakened and promises to end the world with his own miserable fate
YOU1000000021_S0000076	on his way out he is met by angeal as well as hollander who explains the g in project g was not for genesis but for jillian who was angeal is mother who apparently took her own life earlier in venora
YOU1000000021_S0000077	the experiment was twofold jillian had jenova cells injected into her while she was pregnant with angeal and genesis simply had jenova cells implanted directly into him as a test tube baby
YOU1000000021_S0000078	what this resulted in was the failure genesis growing up strong but doomed to a short lifespan while angeal was perceived and born as a perfect specimen
YOU1000000021_S0000079	reason being angeal can use the jenova cells as a 2 way conduit as intended angeal then explains his cells can absorb genetic traits and pass it to others beyond what genesis can manage which is only imprint them onto others
YOU1000000021_S0000080	choosing to end his suffering by his own hands angeal casts away hollander and absorbs a variety of monsters he created to help test and strengthen zack
YOU1000000021_S0000081	the resulting abomination slashes zack cleanly on the cheek and he is forced to kill the resulting mess that used to be his friend and mentor
YOU1000000021_S0000082	after winning a bitter victory a degrading angeal is grateful that zack ended him with dignity and honor before dying he passes on his family sword and legacy of honor the buster sword to zack
YOU1000000021_S0000084	even after returning to midgar zack openly mourns the eryth with whom he is developed a much closer relationship and has chosen to retain the scar angeal gave him as a memento
YOU1000000021_S0000085	time passes as zakeda is hairstyle has matured
YOU1000000021_S0000086	he is no longer the young puppy he used to be and is now a mentor himself to a new class of soldier rookies
YOU1000000021_S0000087	shinra sends him for some r r at costa del sol with cisne watching over him as it turns out director lazard has since gone missing and was secretly using company money to fuel hollander is research
YOU1000000021_S0000088	she teases him about his girlfriend ereth and explains she is under constant turk surveillance as it turns out she is the last living member of a race called the ancient
YOU1000000021_S0000089	zack is surprised not only to learn this but also that aerith never told him
YOU1000000021_S0000090	unexpectedly genesis copies attack from the sea which can only mean genesis is still around too
YOU1000000021_S0000091	song is not so sure and conjectures that since all souls returned to the lifestream it is possible genesis is soul is still able to control his copies from there as well
YOU1000000021_S0000092	and so zack is vacation is over as the 3 of them are to investigate an attack on junon
YOU1000000021_S0000093	it turns out more genesis clones were attacking and this time hollander was even there though he gets away once again
YOU1000000021_S0000094	sephiroth comes by to greet zack and questions if genesis really did die he deliberately drops that even the slums in midgar are being attacked encourages zack to return there and promises they will meet again
YOU1000000021_S0000095	returning to aerith he finds a monster dog there but it is not really causing problems though zack notes it is also an angelic copy and is keen to protect aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000096	however its weak due to degradation and chooses to rest in the rafters meanwhile zack bails aerith a card to sell flowers from and has her give him a list of her wishes so he can do his best to make her happy
YOU1000000021_S0000097	unfortunately an urgent mission comes up to separate their time together
YOU1000000021_S0000099	now sephiroth and zack have been dispatched to come in after a monster outbreak near a rural mako reactor that has even killed a soldier operative there
YOU1000000021_S0000100	interestingly these operatives were tracking the missing lazard and reported a strange pod device similar to hollander is which means lazard hollander and genesis might all be involved here
YOU1000000021_S0000101	as their mission in mentions nothing of their old friends sephiroth privately confesses to zack that he is seriously considering leaving shinra as well depending on what happens in this mission
YOU1000000021_S0000102	before departing zack spends some precious time with aerith though song is never far off
YOU1000000021_S0000103	song promises to protect aaron as he is always done and zack sincerely thinks of him as the only person he can rely on these days
YOU1000000021_S0000104	before the mission cloud turns out to be one of the 3 dispatched to him and turns out the reactor they must investigate is in cloud is hometown of nibelheim
YOU1000000021_S0000105	as they arrive sephiroth makes small talk asking cloud how it feels to be home again and trying to relate as he has no original town and all he knows is his mother is name to be jenova who died after he was born
YOU1000000021_S0000106	in town they are met by a local town girl by the name of tifa
YOU1000000021_S0000107	when tifa learns he is a soldier 1st class she seems surprised by the fact that they only sent him and sephiroth and begins to ask something else but stops and runs off instead
YOU1000000021_S0000108	as sephiroth moves on to investigate he tells cloud he can visit his family while he is in town and when zack wonders why cloud is hesitating in wearing his helmet and mask he admits its something embarrassingly personal
YOU1000000021_S0000109	he later admits he was exaggerating and telling his friends back home that he was already a soldier 1st class and is too ashamed to confront that lie now
YOU1000000021_S0000110	meanwhile sephiroth finds this whole area oddly familiar and after they learn t fist to be their guide to the reactor they pause to have a group photo taken
YOU1000000021_S0000111	as zack sephiroth tifa and a hiding cloud arrive at the reactor cloud is told to wait outside with tifa and keep her safe
YOU1000000021_S0000112	within zack finds it interesting that the chamber to the reactor is also named the same as sephiroth is mother as the war hero sephiroth identifies the cause of the reactor malfunction
YOU1000000021_S0000113	zack peers into one of the pods powering the plant and is shocked to find a monster within
YOU1000000021_S0000114	sephiroth explains that while the average soldier is a mako infused human they are still simply stronger than normal humans
YOU1000000021_S0000115	however this thing has mako levels exponentially higher than even a soldier sephiroth does not know what they are beyond that they are abominations created by doctor hojo in his lab
YOU1000000021_S0000116	zach notes sephiroth is well above average himself and asks if there is something more to that and it triggers a splitting headache for sephiroth
YOU1000000021_S0000117	sephiroth comes to a horrifying hypothesis that it is possible he was created the same way and it becomes a crisis of identity ironically identical to his friends genesis and angeal
YOU1000000021_S0000118	he admits he always knew he was unlike other children growing up but could never place why and does not want to think the reason could be that he has been the same as a monster
YOU1000000021_S0000119	he questions his humanity when suddenly a sneak attack by genesis knocks zack back
YOU1000000021_S0000120	genesis swoops in to inform sephiroth that of the 3 friends he was the greatest monster to come out of the jenova project possibly due to having hojo instead of hollander managing him
YOU1000000021_S0000121	zack is more focused on the confirmed existence of genesis but he is ignored as genesis continues to push sephiroth with his past
YOU1000000021_S0000122	he explains the jenova projects were all projects involving usage of jenova is cells jenova herself was excavated from a 2000 year old rock layer and is a true monster herself
YOU1000000021_S0000123	sandbroth is shocked again yet genesis continues exposing that jenova project g created successes like angeo and failures like himself
YOU1000000021_S0000124	and jenova project s used the remains of every experiment thus far to create a perfect monster sephiroth himself
YOU1000000021_S0000125	in addition sephiroth cannot copy or diffuse his genes so he cannot degrade
YOU1000000021_S0000126	he makes another plea for sephiroth to share cells with him and sephiroth replies that regardless of anything he just said being true or not he will do the right thing and let the evil genesis rot
YOU1000000021_S0000127	however zack moves after genesis but halts to save tifa and a beaten cloud from a monster
YOU1000000021_S0000128	afterwards cloud wishes he were strong like zack but zack warns him not to get tangled up with soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000129	the next morning tifa informs zack that sephiroth is in the shinra mansion and zack gets a phone call from aerith ending it with a promise to see her after her mission
YOU1000000021_S0000130	meanwhile sephiroth has found an old archive underneath the mansion and within reads many reports on the jenova project learning information such as jenova was also an ancient like aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000131	after waiting 7 days while sephiroth reads non stop zack comes out to discover nibelheim
YOU1000000021_S0000132	is suddenly on fire with many townsfolk slain even cloud is beaten once again and around the corner is sephiroth himself calmly standing amidst the flames
YOU1000000021_S0000133	following him back to the reactor zack sees an injured tifa within hatefully cursing both shinra and soldier
YOU1000000021_S0000134	breaking through the door to jenova zack sees sephiroth beyond unusually unsettled and talking strangely about going to the promised land together with his mother
YOU1000000021_S0000135	confronting sephiroth zack is ignored as sephiroth insists his mother the ancient was the superior race and they should have ruled the planet
YOU1000000021_S0000136	somehow humans stole that opportunity for sovereignty and hunted the ancients to near extinction instead
YOU1000000021_S0000137	finally fed up with the crimes of humans and shinra in particular sephiroth sees what angeal and genesis kept warning about and chooses to stand alone
YOU1000000021_S0000138	embracing the fact that he was never human and thus does not have to pretend to be anymore disgusted with shinra is sick and twisted past of violating his mother
YOU1000000021_S0000139	and accepting of being of the master race of ancients sephiroth severs all ties to shinra soldier and the human race
YOU1000000021_S0000140	he tears away a mechanical facade to reveal a real genoa who has been savagely mutilated and experimented on by shinra and left to be a monstrous battery within this power plant
YOU1000000021_S0000141	zak still wants answers for the dead townsfolk and questions sephiroth is sanity but sephiroth has no more words for any human even if they used to be his allies
YOU1000000021_S0000142	feeling betrayed zack attacks sephiroth who parries him easily and knocks him to the depths of the reactor
YOU1000000021_S0000143	as they clash zack remembers when sephiroth was still the ideal hero and role model to him
YOU1000000021_S0000144	once explaining that materia which allows humans to use magic is formed from condensed mako energy from the planet and contains knowledge of the ancients who are bound to the planet and have the power to control it at will
YOU1000000021_S0000145	accusing sephiroth of losing his way he is countered by sephiroth who considers himself to be the chosen one despite being engineered by humans to be a paragon ancient to do their bidding
YOU1000000021_S0000146	he intends to carry on what he feels is the right of the ancients and rule this world and take it back from power hungry humans like the shinra corporation
YOU1000000021_S0000147	again they clash with sephiroth clearly controlling the duel forced back the buster sword is knocked from zack is hand as zack no longer has the energy to fight back
YOU1000000021_S0000148	after the exhaustive fight sephiroth is fixated on liberating his mother and does not notice cloud coming up behind him with zack is sword and striking him with a sneak attack
YOU1000000021_S0000149	cloud then rushes the team aside but sephiroth comes out bearing the head of jenova and upset at cloud is insulting strike
YOU1000000021_S0000150	zack urges cloud to finish off an injured sephiroth but naturally cloud is nowhere near sephiroth is league in terms of strength
YOU1000000021_S0000151	however cloud makes up for it in sheer guts as after sephiroth impales him on his sword and issues a warning not to make him mad cloud instead uses all his strength to lift up sephiroth who is surprised by the feat and hurl him away
YOU1000000021_S0000152	cloud succumbs to his injuries next to zack and as they both pass out doctor hojo arrives on the scene and chooses cloud to be his next test subject
YOU1000000021_S0000154	the next thing he knows a vision of angeal wakes zack up as he breaks out of his tank fighting disorientation he gets cloud out but cloud is stuck in a comatose state
YOU1000000021_S0000155	after changing cloud into a spare soldier 1st class uniform zack recalls aerith is last letter for him in which she wants to spend more time together which prompts him to make his next destination back to midgar
YOU1000000021_S0000156	however schinner labels them both fugitive samples so they find themselves now running from the army and cissne actually manages to catch up to them 1st
YOU1000000021_S0000157	he pleads with her to just walk away as he knows its a tall order to escape the turks but cissne chooses her duty over personal feelings
YOU1000000021_S0000158	however zack refuses to fight her seriously for now and must leave her behind
YOU1000000021_S0000159	still she follows them and empathizes with cloud is severe case of mako addiction and so helps them this once to escape with her motorcycle
YOU1000000021_S0000160	however genesis is not done as he interrupts their ride seizing zack and pulling out a bit of his hair
YOU1000000021_S0000161	he knows they are hojo is latest experiments and modified versions of jenova is power runs through both of them
YOU1000000021_S0000162	he has one of his clones eat his hair sample in order to gain the cells needed to cease his degradation but all it does is mutate the clone into a gruesome monster
YOU1000000021_S0000163	later zack crosses by his hometown of gongaga but sisnei is there and warns him the turks already expected him to visit his parents though they are also hunting for angeal in the area who reportedly was sighted in shinra is lab
YOU1000000021_S0000164	she is watching over his family for him and teases that his parents have already asked her to join the family
YOU1000000021_S0000165	zack notes something like angeal is also nearby but flies away again and later he is surprised to find doctor hollander and genesis himself
YOU1000000021_S0000166	it turns out that after the doctor nearly died by the hand of genesis he used his cells to stay alive and despite degrading on borrowed time is looking for a cure for that now
YOU1000000021_S0000167	genesis believes a pure s cell sample will stop their degradation and only cloud and zack bear those right now
YOU1000000021_S0000168	hollander makes a grab for cloud but zack puts an end to the doctor once and for all with a little help from former director lazar
YOU1000000021_S0000169	he is white winged and degrading like angeal with his exact face precisely because he has been turned into an angeal copy by his own doing
YOU1000000021_S0000170	while the real angeal really is dead lazard finds himself with angeal is will to save zack and others which means they must stop genesis once and for all
YOU1000000021_S0000171	almost to midgar zack stops to finally confront the failed and tortured creation of a jenova infused human who considers zack a perfect fusion of angeal is will and sephiroth is superior cells
YOU1000000021_S0000172	behind him is a statue to the goddess minerva as well as a mass of materia he claims will return everyone to the lifestream
YOU1000000021_S0000173	zack attempts to calm genesis down and try to help him regain his humanity but genesis chooses to use the materia is power to transform into a massive armored monster
YOU1000000021_S0000174	zack wins over this form reverting genesis to his original form once more who is now cured of his degradation thanks to the materia
YOU1000000021_S0000175	zack sees no reason to fight now but genesis still insists and zack is frustrated that once again he has to shoulder a burden forced upon him
YOU1000000021_S0000176	clashing one final time he knocks genesis back who for an instant turns around and sees the goddess minerva as he always imagined just before falling for good in the lifestream signifying his final defeat
YOU1000000021_S0000177	still honorable zack carries a still breathing genesis and lays him to rest besides cloud and an injured lizard
YOU1000000021_S0000178	lazard says the winged angeal copy from before protected cloud from shinra earlier but it is too late as the final copies of angeal die and return to the livestream leaving zack as his only living legacy
YOU1000000021_S0000179	the winged dog also had a letter for zack in its possession which zack reads
YOU1000000021_S0000180	it turns out it is from aerith and it is apparently been 4 years since their last meeting and this has been the 89th unrequited letter she is sent him
YOU1000000021_S0000181	she mentions her flower sales are doing well these days and despite her feelings for him this would be her final letter to him
YOU1000000021_S0000182	naturally zack is upset to learn he has been unconscious for 4 years but still wants to be with aerith and make things right despite his unintended absence
YOU1000000021_S0000183	carrying cloud he has every intention to get back to midgar save cloud and reunite with aerith
YOU1000000021_S0000184	after leaving genesis to rest genesis is soon snatched away by 2 mysterious soldiers for his class nero and weiss who seek to recruit genesis into their organization of deepground preceding events to be played out in a feature game dirge of cerberus

YOU1000000021_S0000187	at the same time zack and cloud are in the back of a pickup truck just outside midgar and even the turks are having a hard time finding them now
YOU1000000021_S0000188	unfortunately the army intercepts zack 1st and zack willingly chooses to fight and honorably protect cloud despite his own desire to return to aerith and save himself

YOU1000000027_S0000001	hi everyone welcome back to lavendaire and happy valentine is day sending you lots of love today i want to share some self love journaling prompts that you can do today to just cultivate more self love for yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000002	so i will just get right into it the 1st is an easy one that is actually in my artist of life workbook is to list 10 things that you love about yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000003	so this one is pretty simple i know it can be hard for some people who have never really thought of themselves like that so if it is hard for you to find things that you love about yourself why do not you start with things that you like what personality traits that you like about yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000004	or you could ask some friends what they think your best qualities are and then start from there the next journaling prompt is to take some time to sit down and write a love letter to yourself now i know i have shared that one before because i love it so much
YOU1000000027_S0000005	but the fun hook is you can do it on this website called future me where you send that love letter to yourself for next year is valentine is day you know what i mean
YOU1000000027_S0000006	as you are writing this love letter and celebrating everything that you are you are going to feel amazing as you are writing it you are going to feel the love start cultivating for yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000007	but at the same time the fun part is that because you are sending it back to yourself a year later for next year is valentine is day
YOU1000000027_S0000008	then you are going to get a little surprise in a year and maybe you can do this every year so that you send yourself a love letter every year for valentine is day because duh self love is super important and you can never have too much of it
YOU1000000027_S0000009	alright the next journaling prompt is something that i learned from my friend kajo panday this past sunday actually we did a live chat together on facebook if you want to watch that full live chat it is really amazing
YOU1000000027_S0000010	i will link it down below so you can watch the chat also follow my facebook page because i am going to do more live chats and just post more videos on facebook anyway this prompt is to list all the things that you do not exactly like about yourself
YOU1000000027_S0000011	list all those traits that you find yourself either worrying about or complaining about anything that does not sit well with yourself list those traits and then add but i love myself anyway at the end
YOU1000000027_S0000012	so for example i feel lazy and unmotivated today but i love myself anyway or i do not always feel pretty or confident when i am in a social setting but i love myself anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000013	or i think that i talk too much but i love myself anyway do you see what we are doing here you are taking a trait that is kind of seen as negative in your head those traits that you are usually like ugh why am i like this
YOU1000000027_S0000014	or i do not like this part about me basically the traits where you are being judgmental on yourself or hard on yourself because that is what we do all the time and then just listing it out being honest about it
YOU1000000027_S0000015	and then end it with but i love myself anyway so this is a great way to learn to love all that you are the good parts and the bad parts or the strengths and the weaknesses because love is unconditional
YOU1000000027_S0000016	love encompasses all so i know we started out with the things that you do love about yourself and this is another way to kind of be honest about the things that you do not necessarily like about yourself and yet you love yourself anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000017	because nobody is perfect if you think about the people that you love in your life they are not perfect they have flaws they have times that they make mistakes and yet you love them anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000018	so learn to treat yourself in that way like yes i might not like this characteristic about myself or i might feel this way that does not support me but i love myself anyway
YOU1000000027_S0000019	it is just learning to be unconditional with your love it is so great right like i said if you want to watch that full video with kajol i will link that video down below so you can catch up
YOU1000000027_S0000020	next i am going to share some journaling prompts that you can actually ask yourself every day in the morning just to get yourself off on the right foot because every day you want to be listening to yourself and doing what serves you best
YOU1000000027_S0000021	so at the beginning of every day you can always ask yourself questions like what am i excited to do today or how can i give myself that extra care today because i am all about self care guys and lastly what can i do to protect my energy
YOU1000000027_S0000022	and i love that last question i actually have that question in my workbook too because it is like being aware of how you can protect your energy in a way that you are not allowing toxic people in your life
YOU1000000027_S0000023	or you are not just saying yes to people just because you are a people pleaser a lot of times for me personally it is hard to say no but in order to protect my energy and my well being i have to learn to say no more often
YOU1000000027_S0000024	so that i do not find myself in those awkward situations where i am doing something that i do not want to be doing but i said yes so i have to do it and it just does not feel good you do not want to put yourself in those situations
YOU1000000027_S0000025	but yeah i think that is a pretty good start on journaling prompts that you can do today to cultivate more self love in your life also as you are checking out that live chat video on my facebook just go ahead and like my facebook page while you are at it
YOU1000000027_S0000026	because i am going to be doing more live chats here and there and i am just going to try to post more videos on facebook and be more active there
YOU1000000027_S0000027	alright i hope you have a beautiful valentine is day i will see you guys in the next one bye

YOU1000000033_S0000001	can not you just feel it the conflict is becoming apparent in our culture
YOU1000000033_S0000002	it reminds me of those words of john paul ii we are now living in the final confrontation between the gospel and the anti gospel between the church and the anti church between christ and the antichrist
YOU1000000033_S0000004	and if we do not choose to know god is word to believe god is word to follow god is word we are going to be a sitting duck for all kinds of confusion all kinds of disorder those are really important choices that people have to make
YOU1000000033_S0000006	and these choices are difficult who am i going to marry what kind of life am i going to live how am i going to raise my kids what am i going to do with my time my talent and my treasure
YOU1000000033_S0000008	and i have to make a choice today jesus says to each one of us i came that you might have life and have it to the full the question is do we want it
YOU1000000033_S0000010	hey welcome to another week of the choices we face we have a special thing for you today we are celebrating so many years that the lord has blessed us in renewal ministries we put together a special video telling us about the renewal ministries story
YOU1000000033_S0000011	yeah and it is good it is really good
YOU1000000033_S0000012	let us watch it
YOU1000000033_S0000013	yep
YOU1000000033_S0000015	what we are primarily trying to communicate to the world is jesus the holy name of jesus the only name given by which human beings can be saved god the father
YOU1000000033_S0000016	the clouds are opening again and he is saying to the world this is my beloved son of whom i am well pleased listen to him all we are trying to say is listen to him
YOU1000000033_S0000017	look at him look at the gift that god the father is giving us look at the price that jesus christ paid for us on the cross look at how much he loves us listen to him pay attention to him join your life with him
YOU1000000033_S0000019	post vatican ii there were many upheavals and changes that went on both in the church and outside the church and against the church and for the church and it was a whirlwind
YOU1000000033_S0000020	and i began to realize that my faith was not nearly as strong as i thought it was here i was a religious sister here i was vowed to him and my faith was very very shaken
YOU1000000033_S0000021	and it was shaking because there were just so many theories being thrown at us or things that we had believed or seemed to be in concrete were suddenly up for question and i realized that i was not rooted deeply enough
YOU1000000033_S0000022	yet i had had a good education i had had religious formation but something had not transmitted from here to here
YOU1000000033_S0000023	yeah well like so many people i caught up in the confusion of our culture moral confusion intellectual confusion and then a friend invited me to make a retreat when i was a senior at the university of notre dame
YOU1000000033_S0000024	i was very skeptical about it i felt like i was a philosophy major i felt like gee i kind of know about these things and then i just heard this most amazing story about the catholic faith and how beautiful it was but that would not have been enough
YOU1000000033_S0000025	i really experienced the personal presence of christ on that retreat i felt like he was addressing me i did not hear any words but i just knew he was there and i just knew that i had to make a decision about him was he who he said he was or not
YOU1000000033_S0000026	when i was 20 years old in 1978 my sister convinced me to go to a conference at the university of notre dame and i always wanted to see notre dame touchdown jesus i thought i will go
YOU1000000033_S0000027	35000 catholics about 200 priests and bishops it was a catholic charismatic renewal event
YOU1000000033_S0000028	and when i got there i realized i was in a very different place than what it looked like every other person in the stadium i mean everybody seemed to just be so alive and animated in their faith
YOU1000000033_S0000029	i was a pretty nominal catholic at that point i would seen god do some amazing things in my family but essentially that weekend i began to search and to hunger
YOU1000000033_S0000030	if he really was the son of god if he really was alive if he really was present i knew that my search had just come to an end unexpectedly soon i thought i would be searching for years and years and years but there he was
YOU1000000033_S0000031	and by the grace and mercy of god i was able to swallow my pride and repent and go to confession and really surrender my life to the lord and i have to tell you i am just profoundly grateful for god is mercy to me and helping me find him when i did
YOU1000000033_S0000032	i do not know where i would be today without him
YOU1000000033_S0000033	and so i was inspired to call a good friend of mine who was a carmelite sister i talked to her and after we talked for 15 or 20 minutes she said to me
YOU1000000033_S0000035	what are you looking for
YOU1000000033_S0000037	and i said i do not know
YOU1000000033_S0000039	but i want to give my life to god in a way i never have before and i do not know what that means i have given him my whole life he has my vows i am vowed to him what more can i give him
YOU1000000033_S0000040	and her response was very wise we were the same age but her response was very wise she said to me then just tell him that
YOU1000000033_S0000042	so i went home and walked into the chapel and said lord i want to give my life to you in a way i never have before i do not know what that means but you have it whatever that is
YOU1000000033_S0000044	i walked out of the chapel and
YOU1000000033_S0000046	nothing no bells and whistles as they say today you know nothing like that i just walked out of the chapel and started up the stairs i was going to correct papers
YOU1000000033_S0000047	and as i was walking up the stairs as i often say if i could go into that convent today i could tell you the exact step where i was
YOU1000000033_S0000048	when it was like somebody took a picture of water
YOU1000000033_S0000050	and poured it over my head
YOU1000000033_S0000052	and
YOU1000000033_S0000054	that was the only way i could describe the experience
YOU1000000033_S0000056	but i was not afraid
YOU1000000033_S0000058	and i was cynical i was still pretty cynical and so i took a few more steps up and i said god is this you
YOU1000000033_S0000060	what is this
YOU1000000033_S0000062	and he said it is my holy spirit
YOU1000000033_S0000064	how did i hear no audible voice just a thought goes through your head that you know is not your own
YOU1000000033_S0000066	he said this is my holy spirit and the joy that came into my life in that moment has never gone
YOU1000000033_S0000068	well you know when i 1st turned my life over to the lord when i was a senior at notre dame i did not have any plans to go into ministry
YOU1000000033_S0000069	i just knew i had met god and that was the most important thing in my life so i went off to grad school to princeton and then i took a leave from grad school to begin working for the curcio movement
YOU1000000033_S0000070	and then i got involved in the charismatic renewal movement and then cardinal sunis asked me to move to belgium so it is not like i had a plan
YOU1000000033_S0000071	i try not to put any limits on the lord i am trying not to have any presuppositions i am trying to each day get up and do what seems to be the most pleasing thing to him
YOU1000000033_S0000072	so then the last the closing of the event was a big liturgy in the football stadium and i was begging the lord in my heart
YOU1000000033_S0000073	please help me give me the faith give me the love give me something because i do not have the strength to resist sin essentially and to really live for you wholeheartedly
YOU1000000033_S0000074	and i went to communion came back from communion i was standing in my place and this guy comes up to me and he has got his name tag on he is from indianapolis guy maybe in his mid 40s at the time i was 20
YOU1000000033_S0000075	and he said to me he said son he looked at my name tag he said peter do you mind if i share something with you and i said sure he said i am back here about 6 rows and i was going to communion and i saw you and my eyes fell on you
YOU1000000033_S0000076	and i felt the holy spirit touch my heart and say you go tell that young man that the faith and love that he is seeking shall be granted to him because christ loves him and has died for him
YOU1000000033_S0000077	and as soon as he said that it was like a bomb went off
YOU1000000033_S0000079	the grace of god touched me in a new way and i put my arms around the guy and we stood there and just squeezed him and i cried like a baby on his shoulder and i felt
YOU1000000033_S0000080	i felt in my spirit and i think that is the day i experienced the calling for what i am doing right now and as this guy is holding me i am just experiencing a tremendous sense of the love of god pouring into me
YOU1000000033_S0000081	and the lordship and the majesty of jesus christ that he is the lord all power and authority belongs to him and he said my son i am calling you trust me
YOU1000000033_S0000082	and then i looked around and it seemed like people were getting touched everywhere like that and i felt in my heart like the holy spirit was saying welcome the reign of god is at hand you are part of the kingdom the kingdom is alive because the king is alive and i went home my whole life changed after that
YOU1000000033_S0000084	i began with renewal ministries back in actually i knew ralph for quite a number of years and we spoke at some conferences together and certainly had somewhat of a common mind
YOU1000000033_S0000085	and then peter came into the picture as well and the 3 of us just at different times collaborating at a conference somewhere we began to see that we all had a kind of similar message
YOU1000000033_S0000086	i saw ralph martin on that conference for the 1st time ever he was a speaker 1978
YOU1000000033_S0000087	there is a lot of speakers but when he spoke that saturday afternoon he spoke like the prophet elijah for some reason it went right through me like a sword and brought tremendous conviction to me
YOU1000000033_S0000088	that is partly what i was praying for was that kind of conviction and that carried through for me as i left that place i bought every tape every book i could find of his and i read it and i got other guys to do it with me
YOU1000000033_S0000089	and we would literally spend friday nights some friday nights in college believe it or not and we would listen to these talks and it would really burn in us and we would get on our knees we would get on our face in the carpet and we would say lord jesus what you put in him put in us
YOU1000000033_S0000090	and he did that
YOU1000000033_S0000091	well we all had a really strong encounter with the lord in different ways through the catholic charismatic renewal we all ended up here in ann arbor michigan as part of a covenant community and we knew each other there
YOU1000000033_S0000092	but then at a certain point in 1989 things were kind of happening and changing around us
YOU1000000033_S0000093	and we found ourselves drawn together and we felt like the lord was calling us to meet every week for an extended period of prayer and just really asking the lord what he wanted for us and from that came a much closer collaboration
YOU1000000033_S0000094	how it all began i do not know if ralph mentioned this but kind of how it all began was he and i went to hear a talk in detroit at a large conference we came to hear one speaker at this larger conference
YOU1000000033_S0000096	and we heard the speaker was good we are getting ready to leave the guy who was emceeing the event was making announcements just before lunch and he made all his announcements and he said
YOU1000000033_S0000097	before we go i just wanted to mention our leadership team up here and our prophecy team feel called to pray for 2 men who are here today there is about 1500 people in the crowd and they pointed us out and we were not even members of the conference we did not think they were talking to us
YOU1000000033_S0000098	and eventually they said it is you 2 would you be willing to have our team pray with you and we looked at each other and said all right why not and so everybody got excused for lunch we went up there with the team and a mature group of people
YOU1000000033_S0000099	and they started praying for us with ralph and i am just kind of watching and it was one of the 1st times where i saw the gift of prophecy kind of and word of knowledge working in a very powerful way
YOU1000000033_S0000100	and they started saying things about ralph and about his life which they could not have known that were indications of how god had worked in him and what the lord wanted to do with him
YOU1000000033_S0000101	and so i am thinking whoa this is probably getting a little too close i do not think i want to listen i think i want to go before it is my turn kind of thing and so anyway they prayed over me and they said one person said the lord is going to start sowing you into lands all around the world
YOU1000000033_S0000103	and he is going to bring to you men and women who he is already called and he is already empowered to be able to stand alongside you and the one person said yeah i see these images of battleships all lined up
YOU1000000033_S0000104	and they are all equipped and they are all ready to go and the lord wants you to launch them and those battleships are people and bishops and priests and lay people that god has called to go to the world to engage the new evangelization and he wants you guys to help launch them
YOU1000000033_S0000105	and so after it was all done we were driving home and saying wow what did you think of that and ralph just said you know scripture is very clear it says to never despise prophecy but test everything and cling to what is good
YOU1000000033_S0000106	so we began to pray once a week together to say lord if this is you we are ready to receive it if it is not you we were not working together at that time we were just we were in the same community the same parish we were not renewal ministries had not yet happened with us together
YOU1000000033_S0000107	and so we decided to pray and then we invited sister ann and a few others once a week to pray with us we pray each week and try to listen and week after week we would say anybody hearing anything you know from the lord no where are we supposed to go no
YOU1000000033_S0000108	and then at one point a couple of months into it sister ann shields said at the end of the prayer time she goes this sounds kind of strange you guys but i think we are supposed to go to lithuania and ukraine
YOU1000000033_S0000109	so here we are in the basement of a house here in ann arbor sister ann gets a sense we are supposed to go to lithuania we do not know anybody there 2 weeks later the bishop of the cultural center of the country calls us and said would you come and help me
YOU1000000033_S0000110	and what we had heard prophetically from folks who prayed for us said only go through doors that god is going to open he will open the doors for you it started in lithuania and then it went to slovakia and then it went to hungary and then it went to ukraine and now it is 40 countries around the world
YOU1000000033_S0000112	and that is kind of how it all happened and we started once we started we said okay clearly god is calling us what are we going to do so we formed an organization renewal ministries that is how it happened
YOU1000000033_S0000114	this thought came into my head i want you on catholic radio
YOU1000000033_S0000116	and catholic radio
YOU1000000033_S0000118	did not exist except for some work at ewtn but that was it
YOU1000000033_S0000120	and it was just i want you on catholic radio and i thought
YOU1000000033_S0000121	so i went to ralph because this is what you do when you get some thought you know is it indigestion or is it a word from the lord and i said look ralph i do not even know if catholic radio exists
YOU1000000033_S0000123	and he said well let us just pray
YOU1000000033_S0000125	and 6 months later i got this call from ewtn asking me if i would be willing to do a radio program on their station and i said yes
YOU1000000033_S0000126	and they said do not you need to talk to anybody about this or do not you need to pray about this and i said
YOU1000000033_S0000127	no i think the lord prepared me and ralph had said just pray if something happens and we will know this is from the lord
YOU1000000033_S0000128	my religious community had prayed about it knew about it so when the invitation came it was like all the groundwork had been laid so from then on that is one of the main things i have been doing
YOU1000000033_S0000129	speaking writing parish missions all of that and then particularly focused on the radio
YOU1000000033_S0000130	we got into radio which we had not planned at the beginning sister ann programmed food for the journey which is all over the place in the country it is a very dynamic radio show
YOU1000000033_S0000131	and then a few years after that i felt i was in a meeting with ralph just catching up seeing how things are going he said what is the lord saying to you these days and i said you know crazy i think i am supposed to do radio
YOU1000000033_S0000132	we did not have any money for it
YOU1000000033_S0000134	let us just see what the lord does if you are willing so we prayed and then about a week later i got a call from mike jones from ave maria radio out of the blue and he said have you ever thought about doing radio
YOU1000000033_S0000135	i said yeah in fact i have and he said would you be willing to do a show with us i said i do not have any money he said well we will do it we will produce it just come and do the show so step by step things like that began to happen
YOU1000000033_S0000136	crossing the gold emerged another television show on ewtn that we collaborate together with the team danny abramowitz curtis martin and a variety of folks a show that was geared toward men
YOU1000000033_S0000137	and again it was something that was in my heart for years before i felt like the lord said
YOU1000000033_S0000139	you got to start working to reach men and challenge them to dare to believe and to go for it i tried a few things and nothing really took off
YOU1000000033_S0000140	but it was still in my heart out of the blue danny and i met each other at bramowitz our desires and ministry were so common we ended up combining together creating this other show so that is emerged
YOU1000000033_S0000141	another important piece of what we are doing is and have done from the beginning is find a way to be able to engage more lay people directly in ministry and evangelization
YOU1000000033_S0000142	so raised up more and more people to work with us internationally on mission teams going all over the world our country coordinators we call them
YOU1000000033_S0000143	and then the last few years with a heart for millennials we just felt like the lord said there is a in the ann arbor area here there are lots of young people who have a serious call in their life from the lord and they have really grown a lot
YOU1000000033_S0000144	and they just had a lot of support and formation in their life and we felt like the lord said help release them into what i have called them to do make a way for them make a path and so that is partly what we have done too that is where id 916 the young adult ministry emerged from
YOU1000000033_S0000145	one of the really things the lord has called all of us to peter and sister ann and myself is to express in writing some of the things that we feel like are the most important truths that people need to hear right now in our culture
YOU1000000033_S0000146	and so like for example one of the highlights for me was really finishing a book that i worked on for 10 years it is called the fulfillment of all desire a guidebook for the journey to god based on the wisdom of the saints
YOU1000000033_S0000147	i just really felt like there is such a treasure of wisdom in our church in these great doctors of the church but like it used to happen to me years ago the 1st time i picked up a book by john of the cross it was like what
YOU1000000033_S0000148	what is he talking about and what he was talking about was so scary i decided to put the book down and then 25 years later it is just like it all kind of came alive for me and so i just really felt like this tremendous stuff here
YOU1000000033_S0000149	if you could just communicate it in a clear orderly understandable way people would get so much help in growing their union with the lord
YOU1000000033_S0000150	peter is written books like that sister anne is written books like that so part of the ministry is also the writing which has helped an awful lot of people
YOU1000000033_S0000152	john paul was a kind of shepherd and guide for us he was the guy who interpreted for us what the spirit is saying to the church and it corresponded with what our sense was so he confirmed us in the mission
YOU1000000033_S0000153	we had gone to rome we were doing a conference in rome and the last night that we were there we got a phone call from the holy father john paul asking if we would like to come to his mass the next morning
YOU1000000033_S0000154	you know was like like to you know of course so we went there and after mass when he came to ralph who was next to me
YOU1000000033_S0000155	i gave him a copy of my latest book at the time called the catholic church at the end of the age what is the spirit saying he took the book and he said you know i read it already i almost fell over i almost became speechless
YOU1000000033_S0000156	then he turned to ralph and he took ralph by the upper arms he just took him and he kind of shook him like this and he said ralph tell me what is the spirit saying to the church
YOU1000000033_S0000158	and i knew he did not want the whole 300 page answer so i said holy father i think what the spirit is saying to the church is jesus so he took my hand and he said jesus and i said jesus
YOU1000000033_S0000159	we just stood there for a couple of minutes saying the name of jesus and it was just a very very special moment of communion with the lord and communion with the pope and just proclaiming the name of jesus together it was just very very special
YOU1000000033_S0000160	john paul ii is our patron the central patron of renewal ministries he is a great intercessor for us we continue to pray we ask for his help i feel his presence especially when i am on mission internationally
YOU1000000033_S0000161	in a very special way we have asked saint john paul ii to be our patron we also asked mary
YOU1000000033_S0000162	you know she is the queen of the new evangelization she is appearing in the world she is carrying forth the message she is sort of like leading the charge in many ways
YOU1000000033_S0000163	and we pray we try to stay close we try to listen to what is happening through the apparitions that are accepted by the church and what is the message there as well because it is prophetic
YOU1000000033_S0000164	it is a prophetic message and we feel like we are a prophetic ministry in part we are meant to really dial in to try to hear what the spirit is saying to the church today and to be able to communicate that to other people
YOU1000000033_S0000165	what does god want
YOU1000000033_S0000167	from us who are his sons and daughters how are we called to live in this generation in this time and all of the challenges that we are certainly beginning to face
YOU1000000033_S0000168	because right now 1700 years of christian culture is collapsing all kinds of supports that used to be there for living a moral life or all kinds of respect that used to be there for the church for the synagogue whatever just is not there anymore
YOU1000000033_S0000169	and more and more we are living in the growth of an international pagan culture that is becoming increasingly hostile to christ and the church where is their loyalty
YOU1000000033_S0000170	what do they really think about jesus christ are they willing to suffer for him are they willing to suffer rather than to deny him are they willing to do everything they can to pass on the faith to their children
YOU1000000033_S0000171	even when the culture is placing tremendous obstacles in front of it so we are living in quite a time of conflict and decision it is for such a time as this that we have been called to do what we are doing
YOU1000000033_S0000172	i hope that renewal ministries can help people make the decision that they are going to be friends in jesus christ and they are going to be loyal to him even in the midst of tremendous oppression and difficulties
YOU1000000033_S0000173	the culture is lethal
YOU1000000033_S0000175	right now it is not just kind of you know enticing you
YOU1000000033_S0000176	it is just taking people and taking them right out of the framework in which they have lived with the little faith that perhaps they have had
YOU1000000033_S0000177	and even if their faith is strong the enticements of the world are now so strong that if people are not really rooted in god they can easily be pulled out without even realizing at 1st what is happening to them
YOU1000000033_S0000178	so it is in all these ways that i think renewal ministries brings a message it brings the love of god it helps people right where they are you do not have to be ashamed of where you are
YOU1000000033_S0000179	just come come and learn the love that god has for you come and learn the mercy that he has for you and then see as you become a disciple of christ see how he wants to use you in a world that is pretty broken
YOU1000000033_S0000181	you know peter when you are right in the middle of it every day and you are getting up every day and doing what you are supposed to do sometimes you do not get the whole trajectory of what god is done it is just amazing to see what the lord is done with us
YOU1000000033_S0000182	yeah it has been an amazing journey
YOU1000000033_S0000184	a number of things came to mind thinking about it it is not like we had a grand plan at the beginning
YOU1000000033_S0000185	no
YOU1000000033_S0000186	it was the lord was getting our attention and he said look i want you to do something and it was step by step and we had help from other people just encouragement in the spirit
YOU1000000033_S0000187	i was just thinking how pope john paul ii used to say saint john paul ii and now pope francis even says you know that part of the spirit is mission is to reveal jesus to every human heart but to create movement
YOU1000000033_S0000188	and as we together were encountering the spirit more deeply he moved us and he moved other people and it was like we were carried along
YOU1000000033_S0000189	yeah
YOU1000000033_S0000190	so it is just really great
YOU1000000033_S0000191	yeah
YOU1000000033_S0000192	yeah
YOU1000000033_S0000193	it really is true the holy spirit leads people he led us he can lead anybody really it is just really amazing and just the way you told the story about how we got launched into lithuania and all the other countries we were in and how we were able to get to this point
YOU1000000033_S0000194	and to this day i mean like every week we are getting reports from our country coordinators who are doing tremendous things in so many countries around the world
YOU1000000033_S0000195	we did you know last year we did 41 international missions in about 35 different countries in eastern europe africa asia the middle east and collaborating with just some amazing people you know cardinal turks and just you know incredible people
YOU1000000033_S0000196	religious laity from all over the world in a partnership i mean as i mentioned we do not go hang up our shingle around the world and get people to join our organization
YOU1000000033_S0000197	the lord just has given us gifts and experience and resources to come alongside these brothers and sisters around the world and partner with them in a communion and mission that is our contribution to this great moment of evangelization new evangelization in the church
YOU1000000033_S0000198	and we always thought that the lord had given us something that could really help strengthen leadership in the church and the lord has given us so many opportunities now to do that
YOU1000000033_S0000199	i just got back from doing a workshop for deacons in the archdiocese of hartford about ready to go to do a clergy convocation in calgary
YOU1000000033_S0000200	recently did the clergy convocation of the archdiocese of detroit so we are getting opportunities to really strengthen priests and deacons and give them courage and give them confidence you know in preaching the gospel
YOU1000000033_S0000201	and that is somewhat new you know what i mean we have always done that overseas in different places but i think here in the states i mean you have done it more than the rest of us but it seems like the doors are kind of thrown wide open because they are recognizing the same things
YOU1000000033_S0000202	you guys do have something god is given you something we want to listen to it why do not you come and help us out because i think we need it
YOU1000000033_S0000203	i think the church is waking up to the fact that you know what i think we need god i think we need powerful on high i think we need something more
YOU1000000033_S0000204	because the tsunami of secularism is just engulfing people is lives and the statistics are just getting more and more grim and the decline of things
YOU1000000033_S0000205	and we are trying to tell bishops and priests and deacons that you do not want to just kind of preside over decline and downsizing you want to generate a new energy of evangelization and pentecost that can really turn the tide
YOU1000000033_S0000206	and live the new pentecost
YOU1000000033_S0000207	amen amen a culture of pentecost well peter we have so much to be grateful for and one of the things we have to be grateful for is this booklet you have written which is called light in the darkness
YOU1000000033_S0000208	jesus is the light in the darkness and we want you to have this booklet at no cost just for the asking and we will be back
YOU1000000033_S0000210	friends we are living through difficult and challenging times the church is in a fierce battle
YOU1000000033_S0000211	in the words of pope emeritus benedict xvi man is pushing god from the human horizon and as a result the light which comes from god is disappearing and humanity is losing its bearings
YOU1000000033_S0000212	in this moment it is crucial that we hear the words of jesus who said i am the light of the world he who follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of the world
YOU1000000033_S0000213	i wrote this short booklet to help you lay hold of this precious promise from jesus so you can have the strength and the courage you need to be a light in the darkness
YOU1000000033_S0000214	to order your free copy of light in the darkness you can go to renewalministries net or call one 800 282 4789
YOU1000000033_S0000216	peter we have seen how the lord has worked with us but the lord wants to work with everybody like that you know
YOU1000000033_S0000217	right
YOU1000000033_S0000218	so i would just like to tell you folks that open yourself to the holy spirit ask god to give you the power and strength you need for your mission of being a witness for him in where you are

YOU1000000037_S0000208	so they went to hawaii picked the best fish off the farm shipped them to miami then the guys at the miami store brought them up to the show here
YOU1000000037_S0000209	stunning the farm in hawaii is huge they have hand selected the best fish
YOU1000000037_S0000211	i know you can not see that very well
YOU1000000037_S0000213	but it is just a sampling
YOU1000000037_S0000215	of the grade of japanese imported koi that they have they hand selected the best ones and they brought them up for the show
YOU1000000037_S0000217	so and the prices range for the smaller ones we were looking at 2 year olds that were 15 inch average size 500 to $1000
YOU1000000037_S0000218	but they were amazing they were some of the best koi i have ever seen in person and it is so cool because you can recognize a good looking koi
YOU1000000037_S0000219	mean better than the average pond variety which by the way i keep average pond variety even though they are long finned beautiful koi they are just they are your basic pond variety 0 yeah look at this is that a cool shirt
YOU1000000037_S0000221	that is the kadama farm shirt that they brought to sell at the show this is one of their grand champion fish that is a grand champion showa that fish is probably worth $150000 if not more
YOU1000000037_S0000223	everything about this show is cool if you watched any of my much earlier videos i set up a 300 gallon stock tank of koi i bought some baby koi and grew them out over winter in a 75 gallon stock pond
YOU1000000037_S0000224	i really dig the koi so you can check out my koi videos i have got a playlist probably says something about koi

YOU1000000037_S0000240	yes i think you are right kalar is aquatics if that happens we may have to have a fish tube meetup around the river life koi pond that would be awesome i would love to have you guys
YOU1000000037_S0000241	candy overhauls is showing me some love by posting the river life etsy art page which recently had some additions put on it 2 weeks ago

YOU1000000037_S0000244	the paintings up on etsy and i have got another
YOU1000000037_S0000247	of paintings to add to that so paintings are still still coming around by the way i will tell you fish are we got punchy paints in the house
YOU1000000037_S0000248	a certified fine artist unbelievable blow your mind art check out punchy paints pam earlywine is art
YOU1000000037_S0000250	chris at multitank addiction also an artist back in the studio i have got some of his art both prints and originals fantastic fish art priscilla mk who is often in the chat here
YOU1000000037_S0000251	i have got some of her art and you know i am at this show and the 1st person we talked to says hey look i bought these sketches of goldfish that my niece does 0 the gorgeous goldfish sketches with with the colored pencils
YOU1000000037_S0000252	i think that is a medium that chris at multitank addiction uses also they had some of them framed they had some of them printed on coffee mugs just the coolest stuff
YOU1000000037_S0000253	i think this fish art is really catching on because we fish keepers can appreciate it and it is a wonderful introduction to fish to people who do not have an aquarium they can have a painting of a fish
YOU1000000037_S0000255	and i think if we can connect the 2 fish art to people who do not have aquariums to people who have fish art and aquariums we can teach them how to keep an aquarium at least efficiently if not easily
YOU1000000037_S0000256	i think they really they have heightened the enjoyment i have in my life i think they will other people too and it is a good mission that we are on to share our hobby with people
YOU1000000037_S0000258	kayla is aquatics says

YOU1000000037_S0000287	so i am missing out on the tennessee tradition of the koi names
YOU1000000037_S0000289	okay good got a sounds better excellent
YOU1000000037_S0000291	very good i did not see any top dwelling asian fish i am sure you guys i thought about the asian arowana and of course the koi feed at the surface and so do the goldfish
YOU1000000037_S0000292	so all those came to mind what about asian mid swimmers
YOU1000000037_S0000294	we go down a level in the water column in the community tank because it is 1057 92 of you still watching thank you it is almost 110 clock we are almost at the halfway point
YOU1000000037_S0000295	we are down to the middle of the water column talking about the best asian fish for the middle of the water column and i noticed my koi also sometimes like to swim around
YOU1000000037_S0000296	the middle of the water column they rest on the bottom they swim in the middle they feed on the top that is what i see
YOU1000000037_S0000298	by the way i did see some bottom dwelling but i am going to jump ahead here let us talk about the video 1st and i will look for a photograph of a bottom dwelling asian fish i want to show you guys
YOU1000000037_S0000300	the video that i put out tuesday we did the premiere thank you guys who showed up for the premiere
YOU1000000037_S0000302	
YOU1000000037_S0000304	fish dreams hello just saw you over there in the chat shrimp capades i escaped and stocked a one.5 gallon tiny bookshelf tank
YOU1000000037_S0000306	and
YOU1000000037_S0000308	it is a minute and 112nd video i do not know fucking
YOU1000000037_S0000310	sure i can for you guys i can
YOU1000000037_S0000312	it is not performing at the rate that i would like for it to it is fallen below the average rate it was some really cool shrimp
YOU1000000037_S0000314	and i do not know i do not know exactly i do not have that algorithm figured out but i was a little surprised that it had such a wonderful premiere and you guys showed up and then the performance afterwards just seemed to slow
YOU1000000037_S0000315	so hopefully it will make the turn and pick back up the name of the video with shrimp capes i have got some freshwater shrimp blue shrimp
YOU1000000037_S0000317	and neo caridina they are like some blue fantasy dreams i used to have from flip aquatics
YOU1000000037_S0000318	but i got them from the local fish store who sold them as shrimp assorted
YOU1000000037_S0000320	so i purchased 3 blue shrimp assorted and put in that one.5 gallon
YOU1000000037_S0000322	did a video love the video those shrimp are such cute little rascals
YOU1000000037_S0000324	think if you will check that out you will enjoy it the things got video since tuesday has 194 views as at the time we went on air 48 likes so
YOU1000000037_S0000326	it is a little slow out of the gate after it launched well then it kind of slowed down out of the gate so it is good video i hope you guys watch it let me know what you think
YOU1000000037_S0000328	and now it is 110 clock let us get down to the bottom of the tank bottom of the water column and this is the point where we talk about the changes in the river life fish studio
YOU1000000037_S0000329	and if you have been following along with us here in the community tank you know the fish studio is under construction but we are going very slow now waiting on some structural changes to the house so that is going to happen when it happens
YOU1000000037_S0000330	we have got it on a priority list we are getting closer every day but it is going to be minor changes until the structural changes arrive and at that time we also talk about the fish at the bottom of the water column
YOU1000000037_S0000332	so here is a video i made today
YOU1000000037_S0000334	i think that is striking goldfish but this vendor also had some bottom dwellers look at all the banded high fin sharks look at all those little guys
YOU1000000037_S0000336	we had a couple 100 of those and i think those are outstanding bottom dwelling asian fish they get up to 3 feet long
YOU1000000037_S0000338	30 36 inches
YOU1000000037_S0000339	and the vendor told me they could withstand temperatures down to -22 fahrenheit 22 degrees below 0 amazing
YOU1000000037_S0000341	so i think i am going to have to have a couple of those in my life i have actually ordered
YOU1000000037_S0000343	sharks before but high fin banded sharks but they did not arrive i have had a couple of issues with getting them so i am still without and here i am at the show and there are dozens if not 100s of
YOU1000000037_S0000345	so i think there is going to be one or 2 of those in my life
YOU1000000037_S0000347	garami and paradise fish
YOU1000000037_S0000349	huh
YOU1000000037_S0000351	neither of which i associated previously as being asian i am going to look at that
YOU1000000037_S0000353	that is funny all those beauties in the bathroom how does she do it
YOU1000000037_S0000355	we are talking about simply bed as fish shrimp being in a bathroom
YOU1000000037_S0000357	and simply better says just go vertical vertical baby it is not difficult
YOU1000000037_S0000359	alien world aquatics is in the house and before i forget again alien world let me say
YOU1000000037_S0000361	and if you need to rewind this and watch it on replay
YOU1000000037_S0000362	the dark frogs i recommend for you are the larger terrestrial dark frogs the green and black dark frog
YOU1000000037_S0000363	it is scientific name
YOU1000000037_S0000365	it ends in erratus
YOU1000000037_S0000367	formerly was dendrobates do they still use dendrobates they have changed so many of the genus dendrobates erratus and the tinctorius dendrobates tinctorius
YOU1000000037_S0000368	those are diurnal they are awake during the day their call is a very soft buzz you have to have your ear to the tank if you want to hear the male is call and then thirdly the leucamella
YOU1000000037_S0000369	the dendrobates leucomella that is the bumblebee or yellow and black poison dart frog and it has a very audible call it is a loud trill that reminds you of the jungle so it is pretty cool
YOU1000000037_S0000370	but they do not have an on off switch okay so if you love it that is the one to go with but if you are not sure you are going to like that jungle trail in your house during the day it will not bother you at night
YOU1000000037_S0000371	but during the day you may want to steer clear of the leucomela
YOU1000000037_S0000373	those are all larger beautiful and the tinctoris i mentioned it is like blue and bright yellow and variants of both yellow back blue legs look them up online there is 10s of
YOU1000000037_S0000375	photographs and of course on youtube there is lots of videos that is my recommendation for you stay away from the smaller thumbnail size frogs they are more arboreal more temperamental more demanding as far as environment goes
YOU1000000037_S0000376	and the dealer that i have i do not know many i am out of the loop but one that i have confidence in is josh is frogs
YOU1000000037_S0000377	and he had no idea i was going to say that this is not an advertisement it is not sponsored just
YOU1000000037_S0000379	i recognize some good customer service practices there and healthy frogs and great customer support so a terrestrial frog one of the 3 i mentioned i think are all great beginner frogs at an affordable price
YOU1000000037_S0000380	i actually did well with the azureus which now is a subspecies of the tinctorius it is just solid blue with black spots pretty amazing
YOU1000000037_S0000381	but anyway i am glad that you are here thanks for hey danktanks yay

YOU1000000037_S0000437	so we are going to talk about that i will probably will announce it here on a live stream one week and then we will pick a day go ahead and be thinking of a day and time that will be good for a facebook live auction

YOU1000000037_S0000441	i do not know 20 or so of those every time i get an inspiration for a fish i end up doing a series of these little things where i test brush strokes and how colors contrast with each other and shape and layout
YOU1000000037_S0000443	the original painting that eventually comes from all of this thought this conceptual work usually does not look exactly like the thumbnail but then i have these small canvases because we are on the way

YOU1000000039_S0000001	this week we take to the turkey woods it was youth season in missouri and arkansas and the growingdeer team jumps at every opportunity to take a kid hunting taking a young hunter can present some challenges
YOU1000000039_S0000002	but the opportunity to introduce someone to creation through a hunting experience well that is priceless
YOU1000000039_S0000003	£20 one ounce that is a good bird baby

YOU1000000039_S0000009	missouri is youth season is 2 days long and always a week before the regular season opens anyone 15 or younger is classified as a youth hunter rae is 14 so adam rae and i were eager to head out saturday morning
YOU1000000039_S0000011	we have been using reconyx cameras to scout the proving grounds for several months now and we had a pretty good idea which ridge tops and food plots turkeys were using as threat zones
YOU1000000039_S0000012	based on studying the reconyx pictures and videos there is one clover field on top of a ridge we call boomerang that seemed to have the most activity
YOU1000000039_S0000014	missouri is ewe season usually corresponds with the very early part of the turkey breeding season and at this time the hens are still in flocks and the gobblers are not far behind
YOU1000000039_S0000015	the hens are pretty much on a get off the roost and feeding pattern daily they are not all spread out seeking nesting habitat and it is a great time to pattern turkeys
YOU1000000039_S0000016	about a week before youth season opened we moved a redneck hay bale blind at the edge of the power line overlooking the clover food plot
YOU1000000039_S0000018	we set out at miss perfect decoy and settled in the blind way before daylight and it was a really enjoyable time watching and listening to all the critters come to life as the sun peeked over the horizon
YOU1000000039_S0000020	the 3 of us were listening to several toms gobbling in the distance but after a while 3 birds fired up what we assumed to be about 200 yards in front of us and we knew those were the toms we were after
YOU1000000039_S0000022	it is always fun listening to gobblers when you know the terrain and trying to imagine where they are and as these gobblers started closing the distance adam and i both agreed they were really close to a redneck blind
YOU1000000039_S0000023	that was about 150 yards in front of us just over the hill and through some timber
YOU1000000039_S0000025	i could not really tell if they were moving toward us or kind of just going back and forth on the ridge adam hit the call one more time and there was no doubt in my mind those toms had committed and were coming our way
YOU1000000039_S0000027	listening to them gobble we thought they were right on the ridge top and it was not long until we saw those white heads coming down the logging road
YOU1000000039_S0000028	i see it
YOU1000000039_S0000030	3
YOU1000000039_S0000032	can i shoot one
YOU1000000039_S0000034	i would be shooting the gopro
YOU1000000039_S0000036	he is too close
YOU1000000039_S0000038	okay
YOU1000000039_S0000040	you nailed it ray
YOU1000000039_S0000042	look at him watch him
YOU1000000039_S0000044	that is a big one right
YOU1000000039_S0000046	i did it flinch
YOU1000000039_S0000047	no you were perfect you nailed him
YOU1000000039_S0000049	good hooks right
YOU1000000039_S0000050	yep
YOU1000000039_S0000052	good 1st look at those
YOU1000000039_S0000053	
YOU1000000039_S0000054	this one is actually a little longer they are both good probably a 3 year old bird
YOU1000000039_S0000055	
YOU1000000039_S0000057	and 0 man look at that
YOU1000000039_S0000058	it is really long
YOU1000000039_S0000060	what are beautiful feathers are not they
YOU1000000039_S0000061	yeah they look kind of bluish
YOU1000000039_S0000062	yep
YOU1000000039_S0000064	well he peppered his head
YOU1000000039_S0000066	he did not flop around much did he
YOU1000000039_S0000067	nope
YOU1000000039_S0000069	well
YOU1000000039_S0000071	get him out here where we can take some pictures and go back and take him to the house
YOU1000000039_S0000072	definitely
YOU1000000039_S0000073	grant ray made a great shot and that tom barely flopped we got out inspected the turkey shared some hugs and talked about the hunt after we kind of settled down a little bit and we have taken a few pictures we
YOU1000000039_S0000074	i stepped off from the turkey back to the hay bale blind and it was 48 steps 48 yards i got to tell you before we started using winchester lone beard xr i would have never given her the okay to take that shot
YOU1000000039_S0000075	but through patterning and experience i was fully confident she would take that tom down
YOU1000000039_S0000077	based on the spur length about an inch and 316 ths the tom is probably 3 years old that is a good tom anywhere but it was an even better hunt birds gobbled good responded to the call and there was plenty of excitement as they were approaching
YOU1000000039_S0000078	but more importantly it was just a fun hunt to share with my daughter rae
YOU1000000039_S0000080	after every successful hunt i like to take a little time and see what the critter has been eating i call this scouting from the skinning shed
YOU1000000039_S0000082	23 and a half 23 and a half good tom for the ozarks and it is an easy 10 a little bit over 10 inches on the beard
YOU1000000039_S0000083	grant sharing the hunt with family and friends is really important and just as important is properly preparing the meat we all should be thankful when we harvest game and that natural source of meat to feed our families 1st thing to do of course is remove the beard
YOU1000000039_S0000085	so i just put my hand at the base and give it a good tug
YOU1000000039_S0000087	there it is nice full beard turned the turkey up right where his breast bone is to me and i just wanted to open up and see what is in his crop probably not much because we called this turkey right off the roost we could hear him in the tree hear him hit the ground
YOU1000000039_S0000088	different call sound or different volume anyway so i doubt he is fed much but we will see
YOU1000000039_S0000090	and i want to cut out away from the feathers if you cut in you are going to get feathers all over the meat
YOU1000000039_S0000092	and you can tell we are still very early in the breeding season look at all this fat in a week or 2 if we harvest a tom i predict it will not have near as much fat as now
YOU1000000039_S0000093	and you also notice still full of breast feathers means they are not breeding much yet they have not worn those breast feathers off so it kind of gives you a good gauge of where the local turkey population is in the breeding cycle
YOU1000000039_S0000095	this turkey of course came off the roost and it is so empty i am feeling right here and there is nothing in his crop when i opened up the crop and the tom ray harvested there was nothing in it
YOU1000000039_S0000096	apparently that old tom came off the roost and started working right toward our setup
YOU1000000039_S0000098	usually when you open up a deer is stomach or a turkey is crop there is great information that tells us where turkeys are spending time eating but when you shoot a tom that came to you right off the roost oftentimes there will be nothing in his crop
YOU1000000039_S0000100	pro staffers heath and lindsey martin also had the opportunity to take a youth hunting this past weekend they went on a youth hunt set up by scott hook of hook is custom calls the hunt was organized in north central arkansas
YOU1000000039_S0000103	once they arrived in camp they met up with scott and their youth hunter gracie pate gracie is 13 and has tagged a few deer but never been able to tag a turkey
YOU1000000039_S0000104	so who are you most excited about for the weekend
YOU1000000039_S0000105	probably tomorrow morning just getting out there and being able to hear them and hopefully getting a turkey
YOU1000000039_S0000106	have you ever had a chance to hear very many turkeys
YOU1000000039_S0000107	 what
YOU1000000039_S0000108	what
YOU1000000039_S0000109	would you like to add any pressure to mister martin about getting you a bird tomorrow do you know he feels a lot of pressure to get you a bird
YOU1000000039_S0000110	i am feeling a lot of pressure to shoot the bird
YOU1000000039_S0000112	after introductions and getting to know each other they headed over to the farm where they were going to hunt and did a little scouting
YOU1000000039_S0000114	the next morning was opening day but during the night a strong cold front came in and bringing with it very high winds it apparently gave all the turkeys lockjaw
YOU1000000039_S0000116	after a couple of hours of walking around and calling they can not hear any turkeys respond due to the high wind so heath decides they need to find a high spot that is out of the wind and see if they can hear a turkey respond
YOU1000000039_S0000118	after 45 minutes i had a turkey respond and now they are hurrying to get set up
YOU1000000039_S0000120	even though this tom gobbled it every call he threw at him he would not close the distance
YOU1000000039_S0000121	we were sitting here talking about our border collies and labs and mister heath decided to call a little bit and we had a lonely gobbler gobble back at us and we got set up and got our decoys out
YOU1000000039_S0000123	and about that time we just could not get him to come in
YOU1000000039_S0000125	so now what is the plan
YOU1000000039_S0000127	well i got a rodeo this evening so we got to leave a little early and go to the rodeo and then hopefully we will get out here in the morning
YOU1000000039_S0000129	that tom would not commit to come to the calls and gracie had prior obligations that afternoon so heath took gracie back to camp and met up with scott hook and spent the afternoon hunting with scott and his youth hunter cade
YOU1000000039_S0000130	i am here with my young hunter cade cook and his grandfather mitchell some friends told us of an area that birds like to hang out midday we are going to try to slip in there and set up and just sit around and listen and call a little bit and maybe we can get him a shot
YOU1000000039_S0000131	a few minutes into the property they had a cool interaction with a hen and even though this hen was very chatty no gobbler responded
YOU1000000039_S0000133	they ended up moving further in the property and having a gobbler respond to their calls they scrambled to get set up but this tom worked his way in silently and would not give cade a good shot
YOU1000000039_S0000135	it was a fun day with some good interactions but neither gracie or cade tagged a turkey but they were ready to go the next morning
YOU1000000039_S0000137	multiple birds were roosted that evening so a 2nd youth hunter joined gracie the next morning
YOU1000000039_S0000139	peace group set up close to the roost site and one of the birds responded but simply did not present a good shot due to all the brush in the area
YOU1000000039_S0000141	the wind has started to lay a little bit but we are still at it we are about in a turn where we are going to get one
YOU1000000039_S0000143	after that 1st setup the group was working hard to get gracie on a tom before her deadline to leave for church
YOU1000000039_S0000145	they got on another tom and got their decoys set up and with a little calling it sounds like that tom is closing the distance
YOU1000000039_S0000147	bird down congratulations gracie on your 1st turkey
YOU1000000039_S0000148	good job how exciting was that
YOU1000000039_S0000149	this is pretty good
YOU1000000039_S0000151	i could just hear shoot shoot shoot so i just tried to get a shot off
YOU1000000039_S0000153	shoot shoot shoot
YOU1000000039_S0000154	i bet they were
YOU1000000039_S0000155	that is all i can hear
YOU1000000039_S0000156	there was a chant in the forest i bet people on the road can hear it everybody shoot shoot shoot
YOU1000000039_S0000158	high 5
YOU1000000039_S0000160	thank you for calling my vote in for me
YOU1000000039_S0000162	thank you i truly appreciate you all
YOU1000000039_S0000164	0 yeah there you go
YOU1000000039_S0000166	there is one on the back of it
YOU1000000039_S0000168	after all the celebration scott does a great job of explaining why it is important to introduce youth to hunting
YOU1000000039_S0000169	it requires patience it requires a little understanding knowledge of your adversary in the woods if you get down to the most basic things of turkey hunting it can really teach you some lessons in life
YOU1000000039_S0000170	and i am still trying to learn the patient is thing that still has not stuck with me
YOU1000000039_S0000172	we have managed to get a bird to sort of .
YOU1000000039_S0000174	there is a lot of emotions involved in taking anyone hunting youth or adult new or experienced hunter there is enjoying creation there is the potential and follow through of taking the life of another critter
YOU1000000039_S0000175	and there is a joy in providing quality food for your family i can not think of any better tool than hunting for teaching life is lessons
YOU1000000039_S0000176	thanks to heath lindsey and scott for volunteering their time to introduce several youth to hunting this past weekend in arkansas
YOU1000000039_S0000178	during the same weekend matt tagged along with seth harker and his son trace during missouri is youth season
YOU1000000039_S0000180	trace was excited as last season he took his 1st gobbler
YOU1000000039_S0000182	dude that is a good shot buddy
YOU1000000039_S0000184	this year trace was set on taking a long beard and seth and matt were more than willing to help him meet that goal
YOU1000000039_S0000186	the morning started out great as the guys got some turkeys fired up off the roost
YOU1000000039_S0000188	sure enough 2 long beards entered the plot strutting spitting drumming and gobbling they put on quite a show
YOU1000000039_S0000189	yeah it is awesome right do not move a lot until i get in front of your gun barrel
YOU1000000039_S0000191	one of the challenges of taking a youth hunting is getting them set up right and predicting where the turkey is going to approach
YOU1000000039_S0000193	why did not i just point the gun down the logging road when we got here and i seen him coming up the road i was like
YOU1000000039_S0000195	why am i set up like this
YOU1000000039_S0000197	did you ever think it
YOU1000000039_S0000199	not until they got right there and like okay i am good and then when it moves like yo
YOU1000000039_S0000201	i thought they were just going to come out see the decoys and just strut right to them
YOU1000000039_S0000202	he was not ready to shake off
YOU1000000039_S0000203	i was i got because .
YOU1000000039_S0000205	he is in the frame and i can see the gun going
YOU1000000039_S0000207	this hunt was a great example of not having a youth hunter pointed the right direction due to the unpredictability of turkeys even though it did not work out with the tag turkey it was a great start to their hunt
YOU1000000039_S0000209	yep
YOU1000000039_S0000211	turkeys would have been dead
YOU1000000039_S0000213	one reason we have been experiencing some great turkey hunts here at the proving grounds is our intensity predator management program
YOU1000000039_S0000215	we have worked for years to balance the predator and prey populations we use trapping to reduce the amount of predators and the results of that have been very high survival rates of turkey poults and fawns
YOU1000000039_S0000217	but there is another benefit to trapping and that is acquiring the beautiful pelts i saved up some pelts for a couple of years and had miss tracy a beautiful raccoon blanket made with the coyote trim
YOU1000000039_S0000218	i love the turkey hunt so every year we catch several raccoons here at the proving grounds and people often ask what do you do with all those pelts well raccoon pelts make a beautiful gift and there is lots of things you can do
YOU1000000039_S0000219	but this year i went above and beyond i took several of the pale ups that were about the same size that i would caught in previous years and i had miss tracy a beautiful
YOU1000000039_S0000221	large raccoon blanket made
YOU1000000039_S0000223	and how about those pesky coyotes we catch had a coyote buffer put on the outside
YOU1000000039_S0000225	blankets made out of pelts kept native americans warm for centuries this one at least based on what i have seen in museums is probably a little bit more refined
YOU1000000039_S0000227	the process was really simple of course we trapped our predators skinned fleshed and dried the pelts had a tannery prepare them in a garment tan or very soft had another vendor produce this beautiful blanket
YOU1000000039_S0000228	now that there is fewer predators at the proving grounds both me lots of turkeys and fawns will sleep better this spring
YOU1000000039_S0000230	i surprised tracy with this blanket and she was thrilled it is an absolutely gorgeous addition to our home and no doubt will keep us warm for many winters to come
YOU1000000039_S0000231	each week i share a reminder with all of us to slow down and listen to the creator daily i can not think of a better way than sitting on a ridgetop before daylight waiting for turkeys to gobble
YOU1000000039_S0000232	but no matter where you are i hope you take time to enjoy creation this week and slow down every day and listen to what the creator is saying to you thanks for watching growingdeer
YOU1000000039_S0000234	okay

YOU1000000043_S0000019	the problem is it could take you months of trying to learn copywriting to write effective headlines yourself
YOU1000000043_S0000020	well however if you do what i do you just go to the best copywriters in the world find out what kind of headlines they write

YOU1000000043_S0000024	however you do have to pick a good niche for you to be able to actually make money with it
YOU1000000043_S0000025	so in bonus number 3 i cover what good niches are when it comes to affiliate marketing and how to decide which one to pick for yourself
YOU1000000043_S0000026	bonus number 4 is my email marketing fundamentals course
YOU1000000043_S0000027	now with sociable as i said one of the things you can do is build your email list with this traffic that you are going to be generating with the software
YOU1000000043_S0000028	after you start building your email list of course you want to know what to actually do with that email list
YOU1000000043_S0000029	1st of all which software you are going to use to collect your leads how to set that up
YOU1000000043_S0000030	and then also how to write effective emails to those people on your list so you can actually turn the leads into sales now all of that is covered inside my email marketing fundamentals course
YOU1000000043_S0000031	so that is bonus number 4
YOU1000000043_S0000032	and then bonus number 5 last but not least my facebook retargeting course
YOU1000000043_S0000033	now if you are going to be using sociable traffic one way you can easily double your results with very very minimal budget is by adding facebook retargeting on top of it
YOU1000000043_S0000034	now i use facebook retargeting in my own business and every time i do i see my results go up so much more
YOU1000000043_S0000035	because let us face it even if 50% of the people that visit your website sign up to your mailing list
YOU1000000043_S0000036	which obviously is not going to happen it is probably a lot less than that it is probably like 20% but even then you are losing half of all your traffic
YOU1000000043_S0000037	now when you do facebook retargeting you get another chance to target those people who did not initially sign up
YOU1000000043_S0000038	and get them onto your email list or get them to buy a product from you or a affiliate product that you are promoting
YOU1000000043_S0000039	so this will allow you to retarget all those people that leave your website without taking action maybe they were just busy at that time maybe they did not have time to look at your offer in more detail but they might still be interested
YOU1000000043_S0000040	now with facebook retargeting you have the chance to recapture those people get them onto your email list or get them to buy a product from you and this will definitely double your results
YOU1000000043_S0000041	now on top of my own bonuses i am also going to give you access to all of the bonuses that the vendor provided me with to give to you
YOU1000000043_S0000042	now these bonuses are probably what all the other affiliates are going to be offering you
YOU1000000043_S0000043	and because i know that my bonuses are one of the best in the industry i do not want you to miss out on these vendor provided bonuses and i am including those as well on top

YOU1000000043_S0000060	so let us have a look inside the dashboard of this software and let me walk you through some of the features
YOU1000000043_S0000061	so 1st of all the dashboard that looks like this you can see an overview of how many things you have running at the moment inside the software of course
YOU1000000043_S0000062	there is a support link of course where you can get in touch with the support team for sociable if anything is not working out for you
YOU1000000043_S0000063	and then the tutorials where you can see different videos on exactly how to use the software
YOU1000000043_S0000064	so here you can see the tutorial videos adding accounts and groups creating a content stream
YOU1000000043_S0000065	creating and adding stories to a content bucket connecting aweber and getresponse so those are 2 email marketing platforms that you can use together with sociable so you can start building your list with it
YOU1000000043_S0000066	also adding amazon associate tags if you want to do amazon affiliate marketing with this software then there is built in features for that as well and adding amazon products
YOU1000000043_S0000067	adding overlays i will show you later what that means adding custom domains if you want to set this up on your own domain you can do that creating a campaign and checking your campaign stats
YOU1000000043_S0000068	so those are all training videos included but let me just quickly give you a walkthrough of the software
YOU1000000043_S0000069	so social accounts this is where you add your own social accounts so you can add facebook pages twitter
YOU1000000043_S0000070	i can not show you right now what all the options are but there is a few different social accounts available so there is facebook twitter
YOU1000000043_S0000071	yeah it is facebook and twitter those are the 2 social media platforms
YOU1000000043_S0000072	and then on facebook you can choose pages groups or your own personal account so then you post on your newsfeed
YOU1000000043_S0000073	so those are the 3 different facebook options and then there is twitter of course so those are the social accounts available
YOU1000000043_S0000074	so here you can see all the different accounts so i added one of my own facebook pages so i can post to that
YOU1000000043_S0000075	then here we have account groups so that will allow you to put accounts together in a group and then you can post to multiple accounts at the same time
YOU1000000043_S0000076	so if you want to post on a facebook page in a facebook group and on your twitter account with the same content
YOU1000000043_S0000077	then you can group them together with the software and then it will send that same content to all those accounts
YOU1000000043_S0000078	so content streams that is where you get your automated content so here we have an example of a content stream now this was for weight loss
YOU1000000043_S0000079	i can not currently add another stream right now because the software is not live yet it is going to go live at 11 a m and i am recording this a few hours before
YOU1000000043_S0000080	so right now i am not able to add more content streams because they are working on it
YOU1000000043_S0000081	but there is one here already as an example unfortunately the keyword chosen for weight loss was not weight loss but weight so the content is a little bit weird
YOU1000000043_S0000082	but let me show you because that basically covers so much so many different things use weight in their text
YOU1000000043_S0000083	so this does not cover just weight loss it is like here there is like some playstation 4 game review
YOU1000000043_S0000085	automotive global industry so this is like a financial report on the automotive industry
YOU1000000043_S0000086	so as i said there is like lots of different weird stuff going on here but what this would normally do if you put in a more proper keyword like how to lose weight that would have been way better
YOU1000000043_S0000087	then you can see all sorts of articles from all over the web on how to lose weight now we are not going to steal these articles all we are doing is linking directly
YOU1000000043_S0000088	to the original content to the original article but then we are going to be able to put our own affiliate link or list
YOU1000000043_S0000089	building pop up on top of that so what you can do you can add this content to a bucket
YOU1000000043_S0000090	then you have these buckets over here let me show you what that is here we have a bucket
YOU1000000043_S0000091	then i can go click on view and then you see all the different articles that are currently in the bucket
YOU1000000043_S0000092	now if you do not like the articles that the content streams came up with and you want to use your own articles that you find anywhere on the web
YOU1000000043_S0000093	you can just enter a url here and that will add a custom article from anywhere on the internet to your buckets
YOU1000000043_S0000094	so if i go for example to cnn com or let us do cnn world news
YOU1000000043_S0000096	and then here just grab this and then what is going on beyonce performs at this party
YOU1000000043_S0000097	so then you just copy paste this article and then i can go into social welfare here add this to the story
YOU1000000043_S0000099	or add this story to the bucket and then it should be in here somewhere
YOU1000000043_S0000100	i guess it is on the next page 0 no this is the one isha ambani is wedding included special performance by beyonce so i just added that as an extra story in my bucket of stories
YOU1000000043_S0000101	but this bucket is automatically filled by stories from your content streams when you set those up as well
YOU1000000043_S0000102	then overlays as i said overlays is basically where the money is this is the main functionality of this software
YOU1000000043_S0000103	so obviously getting this content is part of it but then once you have the content what do you do with it how do you monetize it well we are going to use it either to build our list or to send people to affiliate offers with this content
YOU1000000043_S0000104	so what you can do with these overlays let me see if i can add more of those yeah
YOU1000000043_S0000105	so you can either add a bar a pop up a notification a full screen pop up or an amazon product on top of that content
YOU1000000043_S0000106	so let me just set up a pop up in this case and then we have a different pop ups that we can choose
YOU1000000043_S0000107	so let us do this call to action one then you can see so this would be directing people directly to an affiliate offer
YOU1000000043_S0000108	so let us not choose that one but let us choose one that is to build our list so that would be opt in then we can say join our community we can give a discount code
YOU1000000043_S0000109	so you can see all these different templates they have already created so that makes it super easy to get started with this
YOU1000000043_S0000110	so this is a good list building pop up in my opinion because it is pretty basic and simple yet at the same time very eye catching
YOU1000000043_S0000111	so now you could change of course all of the text over here so i can just type my own and that will change the headline over here
YOU1000000043_S0000112	now this of course is one reason why i am including my bonus number 2 on how to write killer headlines because you are going to have to create your own headline in this pop up
YOU1000000043_S0000113	and you want to make sure that this is a catchy headline that people are going to want to opt into your list for
YOU1000000043_S0000114	so this is a headline that really intrigues people and makes them want to know more about what you are talking about and then as a consequence they will sign up to your list
YOU1000000043_S0000115	so that is why i am including bonus number 2 all about how to write those killer headlines
YOU1000000043_S0000116	so there we go that is that you can change this logo thing here you can change the button even the color of it
YOU1000000043_S0000117	so you have a lot of options you can add a delay so your pop up is not shown immediately when people open the page but after a few seconds
YOU1000000043_S0000118	so i can say like 5 seconds for example you can say does it show up at the bottom left corner the bottom right corner or
YOU1000000043_S0000119	or the top left or the top right as well so that is like on the page if you have the whole page
YOU1000000043_S0000120	then it can like pop up here or it can pop up here or it can pop up from the top like that so that is how that works
YOU1000000043_S0000121	do you want the close button to show or not background settings so this is white right now but you can make it any color really and then it is like that is really ugly
YOU1000000043_S0000122	so let us leave it white so form email address callback url so this would be your thank you page so this is another opportunity to make money with this
YOU1000000043_S0000123	so when people enter their email address and they opt in then you can send them directly to an affiliate offer so that is another opportunity for you to make money with this
YOU1000000043_S0000124	you can put in an affiliate link right here and then people are going to see that offer right after they enter their email address and sign up to your list
YOU1000000043_S0000125	so that is another way you can okay and then autoresponder this is where you would connect your aweber or getresponse account
YOU1000000043_S0000126	so let me set that up so let me save this i do not know if i can now because i have to give it a title so title test one
YOU1000000043_S0000128	safe
YOU1000000043_S0000130	okay now i go to all responders so you can see test a are a weber so i can change that i can add my own
YOU1000000043_S0000132	autoresponder
YOU1000000043_S0000134	so here i could select a different list okay now it is going to go to aweber and get me to sign in i do not actually have an active aweber account because i am using getresponse right now
YOU1000000043_S0000135	so i hope i can just cancel this no i can not go to my overlays okay here we go
YOU1000000043_S0000136	so this is where you would normally log into your gut response or a web account
YOU1000000043_S0000137	give a sociable permission to use that account so that they can add their email the email addresses of all the people who sign up on that pop up to your own autoresponder lists
YOU1000000043_S0000138	now in addition to that as i said you can also add amazon products
YOU1000000043_S0000139	so here for example you can add an iphone and then you can have a pop up showing that iphone as a product
YOU1000000043_S0000140	so if you do not want to build your list you do not want to have your own website you do not want to do anything yourself
YOU1000000043_S0000141	you just want to like send people to different pieces of content on social media
YOU1000000043_S0000142	and then give them different amazon offers as your affiliate promotions you can do that with this software as well that may make you some quick money
YOU1000000043_S0000143	it is not going to be a super profitable long term business but it could definitely make you some quick cash with this
YOU1000000043_S0000144	so if you just want to quickly make your investment into sociable back
YOU1000000043_S0000145	then just putting out a ton of different content with amazon pop ups could be a great way to immediately make some money with amazon affiliate marketing
YOU1000000043_S0000146	so those are the different options for overlays and that is basically how this works
YOU1000000043_S0000148	so do not we have the different posting campaigns i am not sure i can do this right now okay yes maybe i can so test
YOU1000000043_S0000150	post to here bucket posting from this bucket per day one
YOU1000000043_S0000152	enable overlay so that i can choose which overlay
YOU1000000043_S0000154	giveaway opt in sure posting times okay so now i do not even know what time zone to send so i am going to say all the time but
YOU1000000043_S0000156	i do not know if this is going to post directly though so i let me just double check that on facebook opening this page
YOU1000000043_S0000158	to see if it already posted something but i think this is going to post like once a day so it is probably not going to happen immediately
YOU1000000043_S0000160	so this is the page i added and 0 it did okay cool so i posted that article that i just grabbed from cnn
YOU1000000043_S0000161	it does not actually have an image because i had to add my own image because it could not grab the image from cnn but you can see it did post this
YOU1000000043_S0000162	now this link is not the actual link to cnn it is a link to sociable and here it should show the article on cnn
YOU1000000043_S0000163	but it seems that this one no longer exists for some reason so that is a bit weird but it does go to the cnn website as you can see
YOU1000000043_S0000164	and over here we now have the pop up the overlay that we created showing up
YOU1000000043_S0000165	so this is not the one i created just now this is another one just i picked from the list of overlays available and you can see free report la la la and then you can sign up here
YOU1000000043_S0000166	and then you can click on send me the report but you can also close this and then you would have access to this content and you can just go to home
YOU1000000043_S0000168	i do not know why that does not work cnn style here we go
YOU1000000043_S0000170	seems the cnn website is not really working well inside an iframe so that is probably not the best website to use with sociable
YOU1000000043_S0000171	but if we read any of the other articles i do not know if i can get a link for the other ones
YOU1000000043_S0000173	can i see a preview somewhere let me see
YOU1000000043_S0000175	this is one of those bar previews
YOU1000000043_S0000176	here we go a view yes this is possible okay
YOU1000000043_S0000178	so that is another example but this goes directly to the article on men is health as you can see men is journal in this case
YOU1000000043_S0000179	so it does not show the sociable popup unless it is being posted on social media like this so i can not show you an example of another website right now
YOU1000000043_S0000180	so let us ignore that and go back to the software so that is the last thing
YOU1000000043_S0000181	the campaigns is basically where you set up when the article is posed when the articles are posted on social media what accounts are posted to
YOU1000000043_S0000182	i can not add any more as well because it is on pause right now as i said
YOU1000000043_S0000183	so here we go target account which account which do you want buckets or single articles
YOU1000000043_S0000184	do you want a certain amount of posts per day or per week or per month
YOU1000000043_S0000185	so i can say i want 10 posts per day then it just keeps posting 10 times a day and then you can say which times does it post that do you want to enable overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000186	then you choose which overlay url type there is only one option default so i guess that is just what you choose
YOU1000000043_S0000187	then post with overlay how many of your posts do have those overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000188	so you can say like i do not want to spam people with those pop ups all the time so i also want to have some relevant content without any promotions
YOU1000000043_S0000189	so i can just show the pop ups on 50% of my posts
YOU1000000043_S0000190	and then you can choose which overlays to use so you can add several so then it rotates between those different overlays that you set up
YOU1000000043_S0000191	so those are the options and then you can just post that so that is how you can get the actual program to start
YOU1000000043_S0000192	and then it just automatically works so you do not have to do anything anymore after that it just keeps posting content to your facebook or twitter accounts or both in case you have set up
YOU1000000043_S0000194	i said a group of accounts and it will have all these different articles that it plugs from all these different content websites obviously not cnn because that one does not work so well
YOU1000000043_S0000195	but any other content website that does work well i am assuming that the content streams that actually automatically get content they use websites where it works flawlessly
YOU1000000043_S0000196	it is just that the cnn website seems to block overlays on their own website
YOU1000000043_S0000198	and then of course it pulls all that different content and then posts it on your social media
YOU1000000043_S0000199	and then when people click on those different links they will be presented with your pop ups with your overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000200	so they can sign up to your list or go to your affiliate offers and you directly make money with that content
YOU1000000043_S0000201	so this is how you can use social wall to basically automatically drive free traffic targeted traffic to your offers
YOU1000000043_S0000202	now obviously you will need a following on those social media which is bear bonus number one
YOU1000000043_S0000203	that i am including comes in really handy because that will allow you to add tons and tons of targeted buyer followers on facebook to your groups to your pages or to your friends list
YOU1000000043_S0000204	and then they will be the people who see those posts that your social is making on autopilot and then you are going to have tons and tons of targeted traffic to your offers

YOU1000000043_S0000210	i also did not need any seo obviously because that would only be required when you have your own website
YOU1000000043_S0000211	you do not have to pay for ads as you can just post this on free organic social media accounts

YOU1000000043_S0000218	so i am not going to go through the rest of the whole sales page it is very long what i suggest you do if you want to check it out just click on the link in the description below this video then click on any of the green buttons over here
YOU1000000043_S0000219	and that will take you to the sales page and you can have a look at the rest of it yourself at your own pace in your own time
YOU1000000043_S0000220	and read through all of this different content about this software and also see a few more examples of how this works really really well with this software
YOU1000000043_S0000222	so let us have a look at the pricing so these are the 2 different options for initial purchase sociable lite and sociable pro those are the 2 options
YOU1000000043_S0000223	these are not going to be $87 or $97 those are going to be the prices after the launch
YOU1000000043_S0000224	so the launch is going to start today the 11th of december 2018 at 11 a m est
YOU1000000043_S0000225	that is when the price will be at its possible lowest point $27 or $37 so for the lite or the pro version
YOU1000000043_S0000226	so the differences are light is limited to facebook only so no twitter on light
YOU1000000043_S0000227	you can add 2 facebook pages have a total of 5 campaigns and 5 content streams per month
YOU1000000043_S0000228	with pro you get both facebook and twitter you get 10 pages 10 twitter accounts 20 campaigns and a total of 20 content streams per month
YOU1000000043_S0000229	so that is a lot more with pro and it is only 10 bucks more so it is probably a good idea to grab pro if you want to get a lot of traffic from this method
YOU1000000043_S0000230	then if you want unlimited pages twitter accounts unlimited postings and unlimited content streams you are going to need to buy upgrade number one
YOU1000000043_S0000231	upgrade number one is the unlimited agency license for sociable you can choose either a monthly payment of $37 or a quarterly payment of $47
YOU1000000043_S0000232	now considering that gives you 3 months for only 10 bucks more it does not really make any sense to get the monthly payments because you end up paying almost 3 times as much
YOU1000000043_S0000233	so make sure you get the quarterly for $47 and you will also be able to set this up for your clients
YOU1000000043_S0000234	so if you are an agency if you do digital marketing for clients then you can use sociable to drive traffic to their offers so you can offer this as a service
YOU1000000043_S0000235	and then it does not matter anymore that you are paying $47 per quarter for this because you can charge your clients like a 100 bucks a month
YOU1000000043_S0000236	and even with just one client you will be able to charge 300 bucks per quarter and you are only paying 47 to offer them this service so this makes this a really really good deal
YOU1000000043_S0000237	then sociable rebrand is upgrade number 2 that is $97 this allows you to rebrand your campaign with custom domains
YOU1000000043_S0000238	and this is for those of you who want to sell this as a service especially so that you can use your own agency is domain
YOU1000000043_S0000239	and then it looks like you are offering the service and it is not just some service from social ball that you are reselling
YOU1000000043_S0000240	because then your clients might just go to sociable directly and skip you as an intermediary
YOU1000000043_S0000241	so if you are going to do that you can basically rebrand sociable give it any name you want or the name of your own agency and that is a one time payment of $97 allowing you that function
YOU1000000043_S0000242	then overlay template bundle unlocks a lot of extended templates so you saw inside social wall it had a couple of different templates for these overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000243	now if you want a ton more overlays then for $67 you can pick up oto number 3 that gives you a lot more templates for your overlays
YOU1000000043_S0000244	and that is only a one time payment as well so that is a great deal as well
YOU1000000043_S0000245	so as i said when you do purchase any of those upgrades you will get my full affiliate marketing course affiliation on top as an extra bonus
YOU1000000043_S0000246	but if you purchase social whether you purchase the lite or pro version these 5 bonuses that i mentioned before will be waiting for you in your jvzoo account for free

YOU1000000045_S0000018	right
YOU1000000045_S0000019	a clock striking midnight from cinderella
YOU1000000045_S0000020	ok

YOU1000000045_S0000022	0 i like this i like this and did anyone the pumpkin did not choose you see 3 months old but everybody did not choose if you came to my door on halloween i would be like 0 my god you dressed as chelsea clinton that is amazing
YOU1000000045_S0000023	amazing i have never really thought that i have like a built in halloween costume
YOU1000000045_S0000024	you have a built in halloween crowd where people are chesakins you are like no it is good makeup though right yeah it is a good
YOU1000000045_S0000025	you know sometimes people will say to us you know do you know you look just like hillary clinton and i say yeah i have heard that
YOU1000000045_S0000026	let me say 1st of all congratulations on a phenomenal book i did not know what to expect the book of gutsy women
YOU1000000045_S0000027	i did not know if it was going to be a book about american women a book about political women but it is just a book about women who have changed not just their world but the world in some way shape or form
YOU1000000045_S0000028	what is interesting is that you wrote it together you have written many books separately but this was your 1st book writing together as a mother and daughter
YOU1000000045_S0000029	as someone who is written a book without my mother i cannot imagine what it would be like to write something with my mother
YOU1000000045_S0000030	how do you not hate each other at this point what is the process like
YOU1000000045_S0000031	it was a lot of fun it also did take some adjustment because my mother still writes log yet
YOU1000000045_S0000032	like like yeah writes out the words
YOU1000000045_S0000033	i said this at an event and i could see a teenager up in the rafters turn to his mother and say what is wrong
YOU1000000045_S0000035	because there is a generation that goes like what is that writing the words out with a pen and no auto correct
YOU1000000045_S0000036	no and like no ability to track changes or have comment boxes right
YOU1000000045_S0000037	and you are doing it like are you doing it on computer
YOU1000000045_S0000038	yes like 2019
YOU1000000045_S0000039	how do you so how do you compare the notes then when you like do you bring the longhand into the digital or do you like give it to her and be like you longhand my work
YOU1000000045_S0000040	well so my mother would take photographs of like each page wow and then text or e mail me the photographs of the page wow yeah so .
YOU1000000045_S0000041	like when we were particularly working on the things that we wrote together like we write about rosa parks and claudette colvin together
YOU1000000045_S0000042	so i would like type my claudette colvin essay and send it to her as an attachment like a word document
YOU1000000045_S0000043	and she would take pictures of each individual page of her rosa parks essay and send me page one
YOU1000000045_S0000044	i can feel your frustration as you are telling me this story i am still working through it this is this is nice i can feel that
YOU1000000045_S0000045	why did you choose to write this book together i mean you have had many opportunities you could have written about anything your family politics your life
YOU1000000045_S0000046	but this is a specific book and it feels like for a specific time why
YOU1000000045_S0000048	because we really believe that in today is world the stories of gutsy women and literally there are many 10s of them
YOU1000000045_S0000049	but we chose 103 to write about
YOU1000000045_S0000050	because their stories tell us yes about the struggles that they endured
YOU1000000045_S0000051	and their persistence to try to improve their own lives and the lives of people around them
YOU1000000045_S0000052	but i think especially in today is world we need to be reminded of these kinds of stories and they are historic and contemporary and even a few fictional
YOU1000000045_S0000053	and they were women who inspired me as a little girl and then throughout my life and the same with chelsea
YOU1000000045_S0000054	in fact we started talking about inspirational women when she was a little girl
YOU1000000045_S0000055	and so we want to share these stories and we hope that people can find some message that will help them
YOU1000000045_S0000056	right
YOU1000000045_S0000057	especially you know given the difficulties that a lot of people around the world face right now
YOU1000000045_S0000058	it is interesting chelsea because you have said you know there was a time in your life when you watched your mom running for president and there were more women in space than running for president
YOU1000000045_S0000059	to
YOU1000000045_S0000060	right and now you you have a plethora of women i mean you have 6 in the race and you have seen how many women participated in in the midterms and won as well
YOU1000000045_S0000061	do you feel like we are noticing a shift in society that is positively moving us to a place where there is equality not there yet but just moving us in that direction
YOU1000000045_S0000062	i think we are absolutely making progress i also really appreciate how you framed the question trevor because it is super important that we do not get complacent
YOU1000000045_S0000063	and that we also understand still how far we have to go
YOU1000000045_S0000064	i mean even though we had an unprecedented number of women run for congress in 2018 we were still less than a quarter of all declared candidates
YOU1000000045_S0000065	wow
YOU1000000045_S0000066	so making progress but we still have a long ways to go to get to parody but as we have seen like who runs for office really matters because it determines who holds office
YOU1000000045_S0000067	and i am so thrilled that my children are growing up with the most diverse congress in american history
YOU1000000045_S0000068	you have chosen 103 women in this book who all have different stories of being gutsy but what would you find was the common thread that made them who they are
YOU1000000045_S0000069	one i think the sense of just deep purpose sometimes something that they knew from when they were little girls
YOU1000000045_S0000070	like jane goodall always knew she wanted to work with animals and sally ride the 1st american woman in space
YOU1000000045_S0000071	really became a physicist because she was not a good enough tennis player so she kind of found her passion later in life
YOU1000000045_S0000072	but what is so distinctive about all these women is that they brought others along with them
YOU1000000045_S0000073	sometimes consciously breaking down barriers and sometimes just really aware of their example
YOU1000000045_S0000074	and i find that really powerful and gutsy that it was not just for themselves it was for others too
YOU1000000045_S0000075	hillary i have to ask you a question that has been plaguing me for a while how did you kill jeffrey epstein
YOU1000000045_S0000077	because you you you are not in power but you have all the power
YOU1000000045_S0000079	i i really need to understand how you do what you do
YOU1000000045_S0000080	because you seem to be behind everything nefarious and yet you do not use it to become president what is the game plan
YOU1000000045_S0000082	well trevor
YOU1000000045_S0000084	what does but honestly though what does it feel like being the boogeyman of the right
YOU1000000045_S0000085	well it is a constant surprise to me
YOU1000000045_S0000086	because the things they say and now of course it is on steroids with being online
YOU1000000045_S0000087	are so ridiculous beyond any imagination that i could have
YOU1000000045_S0000088	and yet they are so persistent in putting forth these crazy ideas and theories
YOU1000000045_S0000089	honestly i do not know what i ever did to get them so upset
YOU1000000045_S0000090	but a lot of them live to come up with these conspiracy theories
YOU1000000045_S0000091	and i have gotten kind of used to it it has been going on for a number of years
YOU1000000045_S0000092	have you ever thought of just like meeting someone who says like you did this and just looking at them and being like yes i did
YOU1000000045_S0000094	i mean there must be a little at some point right at some point yeah at some point it becomes so ludicrous and it becomes so extreme
YOU1000000045_S0000095	well i have had encounters like that and many of my friends have had because
YOU1000000045_S0000096	wow
YOU1000000045_S0000097	yeah they have called up people to urge them to vote for me
YOU1000000045_S0000098	they have knocked on a door and somebody will say 0 i could not do that because and then they launch into one of their big conspiracies
YOU1000000045_S0000099	and i had one friend one very dear friend who i literally have known my entire life and she said she listened to this ridiculous conspiracy about me
YOU1000000045_S0000100	and she said you know i have known her since we were in 6th grade and none of that is true and this man looked at her and said but i saw it on the internet
YOU1000000045_S0000102	but i also think it is because it is effective like i will never forget reading an article after the 2016 election
YOU1000000045_S0000103	where the reporter interviewed someone who had been an undecided voter
YOU1000000045_S0000104	and he said you know he thought my mom had won all 3 debates she clearly had a greater command of the subject matter and yet he just kept reading that she had murdered more than 50 people
YOU1000000045_S0000105	and he said somewhat nonchalantly like i do not think that she murdered 50 but like what if she murdered 2
YOU1000000045_S0000106	and so you just think it is this like constant erosion of truth and sanity
YOU1000000045_S0000107	right
YOU1000000045_S0000108	but my favorite and the one that i do secretly hope may be true is that my mother apparently adopted an alien in 1993 and i have always wanted a sibling
YOU1000000045_S0000109	maybe that one will prove
YOU1000000045_S0000110	trevor you have to laugh at it because it is so crazy but on the other hand we face a serious problem
YOU1000000045_S0000111	of a lot of these falsehoods and these crazy stories taking on lives of their own
YOU1000000045_S0000112	not about me but about everybody and particularly anybody in the public arena
YOU1000000045_S0000113	and i have been very outspoken about the decision by facebook to allow truly false political ads to be run
YOU1000000045_S0000114	i want to applaud twitter for announcing they were not going to let that go forward and i hope i really hope facebook changes their mind
YOU1000000045_S0000115	because more than half the people in america get their news from facebook and you i mean that is the .
YOU1000000045_S0000116	well but no but facebook but facebook is is a real issue and we are living in a world where people no longer know what truth is and do not even agree on it which which seems to be a larger issue
YOU1000000045_S0000117	you have witnessed the change in politics through many different times
YOU1000000045_S0000118	in fact we are in an interesting period now where the country is gearing up for impeachment
YOU1000000045_S0000119	and you are in an interesting position where in your life you have been literally a part of every single impeachment in some way shape or form
YOU1000000045_S0000120	you had the watergate investigations that you were a part of you then had your husband who was impeached and now your political opponent is getting impeached
YOU1000000045_S0000121	do you have the impeachment touch is this like a thing
YOU1000000045_S0000122	you know i was not part of andrew johnson but you know other
YOU1000000045_S0000123	it is a strange perspective to have because i was a young lawyer investigating richard nixon
YOU1000000045_S0000124	and i am very pleased that the house today is proceeding in such a deliberative manner they had that vote today about the procedures
YOU1000000045_S0000125	because that is what happened in 1974 at 1st the american people looked at the idea that nixon would be impeached after he won a massive landslide in 1972
YOU1000000045_S0000126	and they thought well that does not make any sense but as the evidence came out and we were literally working 18 hours a day
YOU1000000045_S0000127	compiling evidence making the legal arguments the constitutional arguments
YOU1000000045_S0000128	and finally people realized that .
YOU1000000045_S0000129	yeah obstruction of justice abuse of power contempt of congress are not what we want to turn a blind eye to in our country
YOU1000000045_S0000130	we need checks and balances it is one of the reasons why the rule of law is at the core of our democracy
YOU1000000045_S0000131	so i know the difference about how the house is power is supposed to work
YOU1000000045_S0000132	because i was part of seeing it work i believe in the right way one of the people we profile is barbara jordan
YOU1000000045_S0000133	who if you go to youtube you can see her speech when she voted on the articles of impeachment in 1974 with her defense of the constitution
YOU1000000045_S0000134	and so i am hoping that now that this is going to move toward public hearings
YOU1000000045_S0000135	where people can see these witnesses in person they can be like a juror themselves trying to decide
YOU1000000045_S0000136	that the american people will you know make a very careful study of what they are being told
YOU1000000045_S0000137	because the founders put impeachment in the constitution for a reason
YOU1000000045_S0000138	we have elections but in between elections if there is behavior that is undermining our country endangering our national security
YOU1000000045_S0000139	as the allegations here are it is an extraordinary remedy but one that has to be exercised in a sober careful way
YOU1000000045_S0000140	it is interesting because america is in a place where it feels like this process and procedure will be tested more than ever before because of how partisan america has become
YOU1000000045_S0000141	because of how you know toxic politics in america has become
YOU1000000045_S0000142	and i i was interested chelsea because i have noticed a lot of people have asked you why you are not running for an open seat in chappaqua
YOU1000000045_S0000143	you are a resident of new york state there is a seat that is open and you have the ability to take that seat in many people is opinion
YOU1000000045_S0000144	and you have often said no there is other young people who could take it and everyone said yes but you would definitely you know take that seat and you would run with it and you have said you are interested in changing people is lives
YOU1000000045_S0000145	do you ever hesita hesitancy to engage in politics because of how your mom has been treated in her life
YOU1000000045_S0000146	no because i see her get up every day and still engage
YOU1000000045_S0000147	and so for me the decision to not even think about kind of running for
YOU1000000045_S0000148	the seat that congresswoman nita lowey will leave at the end of next year
YOU1000000045_S0000149	is more about an affirmation of what i am doing now
YOU1000000045_S0000150	and i am thrilled that there are already so many people who have thrown their hats into the ring
YOU1000000045_S0000151	and i hope that young people do not kind of see the toxicity in this moment and turn away from it i hope they see it and say i want to change that
YOU1000000045_S0000152	and i want to get back to a place of science and evidence based decisions and respect for our democracy and respect for the rule of law
YOU1000000045_S0000153	so i hope people take it perversely as an opportunity
YOU1000000045_S0000154	right
YOU1000000045_S0000155	for what must be different and then be part of the change of doing that
YOU1000000045_S0000156	because it has not always been like that we have had partisanship from the very beginning
YOU1000000045_S0000157	but there is also been a lot of effort to find common ground so back to the nixon impeachment
YOU1000000045_S0000158	when the articles of impeachment were voted on members of the republican party in the congress voted for one or more of them
YOU1000000045_S0000159	so there has been many times we have
YOU1000000045_S0000160	you write about margaret chase smith a republican woman senator from maine who was the 1st member of her party to stand up to joseph mccarthy in the early 1950s
YOU1000000045_S0000161	so we have had not only people but a consensus around what it is we are trying to protect and cherish
YOU1000000045_S0000162	and so i can hope that maybe there will be enough people who make their decision not on protecting the president but protecting the country
YOU1000000045_S0000163	either way they end up
YOU1000000045_S0000164	it is interesting because many of the the women you have written about in the book also share one common trait and that is the obstacles they had to overcome
YOU1000000045_S0000165	often included being accused of things or being scrutinized in a way that was not similar to the men around them to their male counterparts
YOU1000000045_S0000166	how would you respond to a trump supporter if they took the time to listen to you and said
YOU1000000045_S0000167	hillary i do not think it is fair that trump is going to be impeached for getting information from ukraine
YOU1000000045_S0000168	when your team engaged in russian information through you know the co the the team that worked on that side on the steele dossier
YOU1000000045_S0000169	how do you respond to that person when they say you engaged in foreign information on a political rival trump did the same what is the difference
YOU1000000045_S0000170	there is a huge difference you know if you look at the power that the president holds
YOU1000000045_S0000171	the president is in a position to use american leverage and credibility to achieve the goals of our nation
YOU1000000045_S0000172	so i could imagine no i could imagine a conversation where a president would say to the president of ukraine
YOU1000000045_S0000173	you are new at the job one of the things that has held you back is corruption we want to help you fight corruption
YOU1000000045_S0000174	but we want evidence that you are really dedicated to fighting corruption if that is all that had been said
YOU1000000045_S0000175	there is nothing wrong with that
YOU1000000045_S0000176	as secretary of state i used to go and visit leaders and say you know one of your biggest problems is you have got rampant corruption
YOU1000000045_S0000177	it is in your family it is in your people around you you have got to deal with it
YOU1000000045_S0000178	but that is not what happened and we now have not only the whistleblower and the alleged incomplete transcript
YOU1000000045_S0000179	we now have a lot of witnesses who are all saying this was about helping the president himself
YOU1000000045_S0000180	he is acting as the president he is not a political candidate he is not a private citizen he is the president
YOU1000000045_S0000181	that works for the united states
YOU1000000045_S0000182	he works in the united states and we do not want to squander our credibility
YOU1000000045_S0000183	so if other countries see this as they clearly are
YOU1000000045_S0000184	that this president really could care less about ukraine could care less whether it becomes a stable country could care less whether it is able to defend itself against russia
YOU1000000045_S0000185	all he wants is for them to manufacture some kind of damaging information
YOU1000000045_S0000186	about the person he thinks is his likely opponent joe biden
YOU1000000045_S0000187	so there is a huge difference i mean people can gather information in all kinds of different ways
YOU1000000045_S0000188	but when you combine it with that quid pro quo that existed in that conversation which has now been verified repeatedly
YOU1000000045_S0000189	by people who were in the room people who were under pressure
YOU1000000045_S0000190	to deprive the ukrainians of military aid so they could defend themselves there is an active war going on in eastern ukraine
YOU1000000045_S0000191	the russians and their proxies are still killing ukrainians
YOU1000000045_S0000192	what this president has basically done is say i do not care i do not care about any of that i just need some dirt
YOU1000000045_S0000193	and i do not care if you make it up in order to get military aid you have got to give me something on joe biden and his son
YOU1000000045_S0000194	it really does seem like trump has taken an unconventional approach at to say the least in international affairs
YOU1000000045_S0000195	he has been very explicit in saying it is america 1st and that is all i care about syria has been an interesting case
YOU1000000045_S0000196	and and as a former secretary you you have the ability to speak to this with an in depth knowledge
YOU1000000045_S0000197	trump said i pulled the troops out because it is time for america to leave these endless wars everyone spoke out against trump for doing this
YOU1000000045_S0000198	but it was one of your former ambassadors robert ford who said at one point that the alliance with the kurds was never meant to be permanent
YOU1000000045_S0000199	it was just meant to be a temporary coming together because both sides wanted to beat isis and they were not allies of all time what do you think is the more correct approach then
YOU1000000045_S0000200	look i do not think his real philosophy is america 1st i think it is trump 1st and he judges everything as to how it will help him
YOU1000000045_S0000201	and perhaps he impulsively decided that bringing our troops home was good for him politically
YOU1000000045_S0000202	and that seems to be how he is justifying it
YOU1000000045_S0000203	but let us assume we had a president who was interested in achieving that goal in a defensible way
YOU1000000045_S0000204	here is what could have happened he could have very well have said to the people who know something about syria the kurds the turks and others
YOU1000000045_S0000205	and said we need to start a process in order to figure out how we can protect the kurds who have been our allies
YOU1000000045_S0000206	maybe not for all time
YOU1000000045_S0000207	but they sure have been sacrificing on behalf of our objective to drive the islamic state out of syria
YOU1000000045_S0000208	and we know they are holding 10s of 1000s of prisoners for us so let us not leave them to their fates
YOU1000000045_S0000209	let us figure out how we work with the turks who are worried about their border let us see how we work with the kurds let us use the leverage we have
YOU1000000045_S0000210	because we still have troops that are special forces who are working alongside the kurds and let us figure out how we are going to make this happen
YOU1000000045_S0000211	instead of just waking up and walking to the south lawn of the white house and say we are bringing all our troops home and i have talked to president erdogan
YOU1000000045_S0000212	and since we do not know what he says on these calls for all we know it could be hey you know president erdogan we are going to take our troops out what do you have on joe biden
YOU1000000045_S0000213	we do not know
YOU1000000045_S0000214	right
YOU1000000045_S0000215	and that is what is so frightening about what is happening
YOU1000000045_S0000216	because he has an affinity for dictators he is clearly misjudged the north koreans
YOU1000000045_S0000217	kim jong un has been firing missiles and obviously not behaving the way that a meeting with the president should have led him to
YOU1000000045_S0000218	he clearly does putin is bidding i mean putin could not be happier to have the ukrainians caught up in this
YOU1000000045_S0000219	while he continues to eat away at their country and their sovereignty
YOU1000000045_S0000220	the russians have a huge amount of influence now in the middle east
YOU1000000045_S0000221	because they are right there in syria alongside the iranians and propping up the assad government
YOU1000000045_S0000222	so there is a lot of moving pieces on this complex chessboard
YOU1000000045_S0000223	and i have been in a white house situation room where the president was demanding information
YOU1000000045_S0000224	not acting on impulse where we were running through different scenarios where we had to be constantly testing our opinions against others
YOU1000000045_S0000225	in order to give the president the best advice that is not happening in this white house
YOU1000000045_S0000226	it is unfortunately unpredictable about what he will do next
YOU1000000045_S0000227	so therefore other countries particularly ones adversarial to us
YOU1000000045_S0000228	are going around the world saying you can not you can not count on america anymore you know count on us
YOU1000000045_S0000229	we will sell you arms not the americans we will make deals with you not the americans we will have investments in your country not the americans
YOU1000000045_S0000230	and it is a tragedy
YOU1000000045_S0000231	because i think we were really well positioned at the end of the obama administration to keep building on our leadership
YOU1000000045_S0000232	and i think that has been squandered under this president
YOU1000000045_S0000233	let me ask you one question before we wrap it up the book of gutsy women talks about women who have done something amazing throughout time
YOU1000000045_S0000234	one thing that we can not deny has changed throughout time has been politics and the way we see the world
YOU1000000045_S0000235	i have always been fascinated as to your relationship you know you are you are your mother is daughter yes
YOU1000000045_S0000236	but you are younger than her are there ever political ideas or you know conversations you have where you do not agree or you have changed how you see an idea because of your age difference
YOU1000000045_S0000237	yes
YOU1000000045_S0000238	yes absolutely i think most notably on gay marriage and equal marriage rights
YOU1000000045_S0000239	which is something that we talked about extensively
YOU1000000045_S0000240	wow
YOU1000000045_S0000241	throughout years and
YOU1000000045_S0000242	i am really grateful and proud of my mom for her shift to being just a dogged determined not only supporter but advocate for equal marriage rights
YOU1000000045_S0000243	you were like in the house and you were like mom got to get gay rights going come on
YOU1000000045_S0000244	that is like a weird fight to be having with your mom i am not it is like i was like i want to go to a party and you were like mom gay people need to get married
YOU1000000045_S0000245	go to your room young lady that is pretty wild
YOU1000000045_S0000247	i mean well yes but hopefully in a nicer tone
YOU1000000045_S0000248	but chelsea was you know really one of the strong voices on behalf of gay marriage here in new york
YOU1000000045_S0000249	she gave lots of speeches she was part of a group of leaders that were advocating for it
YOU1000000045_S0000250	and you know i really respect and listen to her about all kinds of things
YOU1000000045_S0000251	and this was something that made a lot of sense to me especially because she had such passion about it
YOU1000000045_S0000252	well i will tell you this it is a book of gutsy women written by 2 of the gutsiest thank you so much for being on the show wonderful having you here
YOU1000000045_S0000253	the book of waxy women is available now secretary hillary rodham clinton and chelsea clinton everybody
YOU1000000101_S0000001	the following pre recorded political program is sponsored by tv for goldwater miller on behalf of barry goldwater republican candidate for president of the united states
YOU1000000101_S0000002	ladies and gentlemen we take pride in presenting a thoughtful address by ronald reagan mister reagan
YOU1000000101_S0000004	thank you
YOU1000000101_S0000006	thank you very much
YOU1000000101_S0000008	thank you and good evening the sponsor has been identified but unlike most television programs the performer has not been provided with a script
YOU1000000101_S0000009	as a matter of fact i have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks
YOU1000000101_S0000010	i have spent most of my life as a democrat i recently have seen fit to follow another course
YOU1000000101_S0000011	i believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines
YOU1000000101_S0000013	now one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity the line has been used we have never had it so good
YOU1000000101_S0000014	but i have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity is not something on which we can base our hopes for the future
YOU1000000101_S0000015	no nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a 3rd of its national income
YOU1000000101_S0000016	today ¢37 out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector is share
YOU1000000101_S0000017	and yet our government continues to spend $170 a day more than the government takes in
YOU1000000101_S0000018	we have not balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years we have raised our debt limit 3 times in the last 12 months
YOU1000000101_S0000019	and now our national debt is one.5 times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world
YOU1000000101_S0000020	we have $150 in gold in our treasury we do not own an ounce foreign dollar claims are $2730
YOU1000000101_S0000021	and we have just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase ¢45 in its total value
YOU1000000101_S0000022	as for the peace that we would preserve .
YOU1000000101_S0000023	i wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in south vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace
YOU1000000101_S0000024	that should be maintained indefinitely do they mean peace or do they mean we just want to be left in peace
YOU1000000101_S0000025	there can be no real peace while one american is dying someplace in the world for the rest of us
YOU1000000101_S0000026	we are at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars
YOU1000000101_S0000027	and it has been said if we lose that war and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours
YOU1000000101_S0000028	history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening
YOU1000000101_S0000029	well i think it is time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the founding fathers
YOU1000000101_S0000030	not too long ago 2 friends of mine were talking to a cuban refugee a businessman who had escaped from castro
YOU1000000101_S0000031	and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said we do not know how lucky we are and the cuban stopped and said how lucky you are
YOU1000000101_S0000032	i had some place to escape to and in that sentence he told us the entire story
YOU1000000101_S0000033	if we lose freedom here there is no place to escape to this is the last stand on earth
YOU1000000101_S0000034	and this idea that government is beholden to the people that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people
YOU1000000101_S0000035	is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man is relation to man
YOU1000000101_S0000036	this is the issue of this election
YOU1000000101_S0000037	whether we believe in our capacity for self government or whether we abandon the american revolution
YOU1000000101_S0000038	and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves
YOU1000000101_S0000039	you and i are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right well i would like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right
YOU1000000101_S0000040	there is only an up or down
YOU1000000101_S0000042	man is old age dream the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism
YOU1000000101_S0000043	and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course
YOU1000000101_S0000044	in this boat harvesting time they use terms like the great society
YOU1000000101_S0000045	or as we were told a few days ago by the president we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people
YOU1000000101_S0000046	but they have been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves and all of the things i now will quote have appeared in print
YOU1000000101_S0000047	these are not republican accusations
YOU1000000101_S0000048	for example they have voices that say the cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism
YOU1000000101_S0000049	another voice says the profit motive has become outmoded it must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state
YOU1000000101_S0000050	or our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century
YOU1000000101_S0000051	senator fulbright has said at stanford university that the constitution is outmoded
YOU1000000101_S0000052	he referred to the president as our moral teacher and our leader
YOU1000000101_S0000054	and he says he is hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document
YOU1000000101_S0000055	he must be freed so that he can do for us what he knows is best
YOU1000000101_S0000056	and senator clark of pennsylvania another articulate spokesman defines liberalism as meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government
YOU1000000101_S0000057	well i for one resented when a representative of the people refers to you and me the free men and women of this country as the masses
YOU1000000101_S0000058	this is a term we have not applied to ourselves in america
YOU1000000101_S0000059	but beyond that the full power of centralized government this was the very thing the founding fathers sought to minimize
YOU1000000101_S0000060	they knew that governments do not control things a government can not control the economy without controlling people
YOU1000000101_S0000061	and they know when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose
YOU1000000101_S0000062	they also knew those founding fathers that outside of its legitimate functions government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy
YOU1000000101_S0000063	now we have no better example of this than government is involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years
YOU1000000101_S0000064	since 1955 the cost of this program has nearly doubled 14th of farming in america is responsible for 85% of the farm surplus
YOU1000000101_S0000065	3 fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21% increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce
YOU1000000101_S0000066	you see that 14th of farming that is regulated and controlled by the federal government
YOU1000000101_S0000067	in the last 3 years we have spent $43 in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we do not grow
YOU1000000101_S0000068	senator humphrey last week charged that barry goldwater as president would seek to eliminate farmers he should do his homework a little better
YOU1000000101_S0000069	because he will find out that we have had a decline of 50 in the farm population under these government programs
YOU1000000101_S0000070	he will also find that the democratic administration has sought to get from congress
YOU1000000101_S0000071	extension of the farm program to include that 3 fourths that is now free
YOU1000000101_S0000072	you will find that they have also asked for the right to imprison farmers who would not keep books as prescribed by the federal government
YOU1000000101_S0000073	the secretary of agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals
YOU1000000101_S0000074	and contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 20 farmers from the soil
YOU1000000101_S0000075	at the same time there has been an increase in the department of agriculture employees there is now one for every 30 farms in the united states
YOU1000000101_S0000076	and still they can not tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for austria disappeared without a trace and billy solis just never left shore
YOU1000000101_S0000078	every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy
YOU1000000101_S0000079	but how who are farmers to know what is best for them
YOU1000000101_S0000080	the wheat farmers voted against a wheat program the government passed it anyway now the price of bread goes up the price of wheat to the farmer goes down
YOU1000000101_S0000081	meanwhile back in the city under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on
YOU1000000101_S0000083	private property rights so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be in a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy
YOU1000000101_S0000084	we see such spectacles as in cleveland ohio a $10.5 building completed only 3 years ago must be destroyed
YOU1000000101_S0000085	to make way for what government officials call a more compatible use of the land
YOU1000000101_S0000086	the president tells us he is now going to start building public housing units in the 1000s we are heretofore we have only built them in the 100s
YOU1000000101_S0000087	but fha and the veterans administration tell us they have 120000 housing units they have taken back through mortgage foreclosure
YOU1000000101_S0000088	for 3 decades we have sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning and the more the plans fail the more the planners plan
YOU1000000101_S0000089	the latest is the area redevelopment agency
YOU1000000101_S0000090	they have just declared rice county kansas a depressed area
YOU1000000101_S0000091	rice county kansas has 200 oil wells and the 14000 people there have over $30 on deposit in personal savings in their banks
YOU1000000101_S0000093	when the government tells you you are depressed lie down and be depressed
YOU1000000101_S0000094	we have so many people who can not see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one
YOU1000000101_S0000095	so they are going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning
YOU1000000101_S0000096	well now if government planning and welfare had the answer .
YOU1000000101_S0000097	and they have had almost 30 years of it should not we expect government to read the score to us once in a while
YOU1000000101_S0000098	should not they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help
YOU1000000101_S0000099	the reduction in the need for public housing but the reverse is true each year the need grows greater the program grows greater
YOU1000000101_S0000101	we were told 4 years ago that 170 people went to bed hungry each night well that was probably true they were all on a diet
YOU1000000101_S0000104	but now we are told that 930 families in this country are poverty stricken on the basis of earning less than $3000 a year
YOU1000000101_S0000105	welfare spending 10 times greater than it was in the dark depths of the depression
YOU1000000101_S0000106	we are spending $450 on welfare
YOU1000000101_S0000107	now do a little arithmetic and you will find that if we divided the $450 up equally among those 90 poor families .
YOU1000000101_S0000108	we would be able to give each family $4600 a year and this added to their present income should eliminate poverty
YOU1000000101_S0000110	direct aid to the poor however is only running about $600 per family it would seem that someplace there must be some overhead
YOU1000000101_S0000112	now .
YOU1000000101_S0000114	so now we declare war on poverty or you too can be a bobby baker
YOU1000000101_S0000116	now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add $10 to the 450 we are spending one more program to the 30 odd we have
YOU1000000101_S0000117	and remember this new program does not replace any it just duplicates existing programs do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic
YOU1000000101_S0000118	well in all fairness i should explain there is one part of the new program that is not duplicated this is the youth feature we are now going to solve the dropout problem juvenile delinquency
YOU1000000101_S0000119	by reinstituting something like the old ccc camps and we are going to put our young people in these camps
YOU1000000101_S0000120	but again we do some arithmetic and we find that we are going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help $4700 a year
YOU1000000101_S0000121	we can send them to harvard for $2700
YOU1000000101_S0000123	of course do not get me wrong i am not suggesting harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency
YOU1000000101_S0000125	but seriously what are we doing to those we seek to help
YOU1000000101_S0000127	not too long ago a judge called me here in los angeles
YOU1000000101_S0000128	he told me of a young woman who would come before him for a divorce
YOU1000000101_S0000129	she had 6 children was pregnant with her 7th under his questioning she revealed her husband was a laborer earning $250 a month
YOU1000000101_S0000130	she wanted a divorce to get an $80 raise she is eligible for $330 a month in the aid to dependent children program
YOU1000000101_S0000131	she got the idea from 2 women in her neighborhood who would already done that very thing
YOU1000000101_S0000132	yet anytime you and i question the schemes of the do gooders we are denounced as being against their humanitarian goals they say we are always against things we are never for anything
YOU1000000101_S0000133	well the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they are ignorant it is just that they know so much that is not so now .
YOU1000000101_S0000135	we are for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age and to that end we have accepted social security as a step toward meeting the problem
YOU1000000101_S0000136	but we are against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings
YOU1000000101_S0000137	when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood
YOU1000000101_S0000138	they have called it insurance to us in a 10 pieces of literature but then they appeared before the supreme court and they testified it was a welfare program
YOU1000000101_S0000139	they only use the term insurance to sell it to the people and they said social security dues are a tax for the general use of the government
YOU1000000101_S0000140	and the government has used that tax there is no fund because robert byers the actuarial head appeared before a congressional committee .
YOU1000000101_S0000141	and admitted that social security as of this moment is $2980 in the hole
YOU1000000101_S0000142	but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they had the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble
YOU1000000101_S0000143	and they are doing just that a young man 21 years of age working at an average salary
YOU1000000101_S0000144	his social security contribution would in the open market buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee $220 a month
YOU1000000101_S0000145	at age 65 the government promises 127 he could live it up until he is 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than social security
YOU1000000101_S0000146	now are we so lacking in business sense that we can not put this program on a sound basis
YOU1000000101_S0000147	so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they are due that the cupboard is not bare barry goldwater thinks we can
YOU1000000101_S0000148	at the same time can not we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own
YOU1000000101_S0000149	to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non earning years
YOU1000000101_S0000150	should we not allow a widow with children to work and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband
YOU1000000101_S0000151	should not you and i be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program which we cannot do
YOU1000000101_S0000152	i think we are foretelling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds
YOU1000000101_S0000154	but i think we are against forcing all citizens regardless of need into a compulsory government program
YOU1000000101_S0000155	especially when we have such examples as was announced last week when france admitted that their medicare program is now bankrupt they have come to the end of the road
YOU1000000101_S0000156	in addition was barry goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate planned inflation
YOU1000000101_S0000157	so that when you do get your social security pension a dollar will buy a dollar is worth and not ¢45 worth
YOU1000000101_S0000159	i think we are for an international organization where the nations of the world can seek peace
YOU1000000101_S0000160	but i think we are against subordinating american interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound
YOU1000000101_S0000161	that today you can muster a 2 thirds vote on the floor of the general assembly among nations that represent less than 10% of the world is population
YOU1000000101_S0000162	i think we are against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony
YOU1000000101_S0000163	while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the 10s of people enslaved in the soviet colonies in the satellite nations
YOU1000000101_S0000165	i think we are for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs
YOU1000000101_S0000166	but we are against doling out money government to government creating bureaucracy if not socialism all over the world
YOU1000000101_S0000167	we set out to help 19 countries we are helping 107 we have spent $1460
YOU1000000101_S0000168	with that money we bought a $20 yacht for haile selassie we bought dress suits for greek undertakers extra wives for kenya government officials
YOU1000000101_S0000169	we bought a 1000 tv sets for a place where they have no electricity
YOU1000000101_S0000171	in the last 6 years 52 nations have bought $70 worth of our gold and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country
YOU1000000101_S0000173	no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size so government programs once launched never disappear
YOU1000000101_S0000174	actually a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth
YOU1000000101_S0000176	federal employees federal employees number 250 and federal state and local one out of 6 of the nation is workforce employed by government
YOU1000000101_S0000177	these proliferating bureaus with their 1000s of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards
YOU1000000101_S0000178	how many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man is property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury
YOU1000000101_S0000179	and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine
YOU1000000101_S0000180	in chico county arkansas james weir overplanted his rice allotment the government obtained a $17000 judgment
YOU1000000101_S0000181	and a us marshal sold his 960 acre farm at auction the government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work
YOU1000000101_S0000183	last february 19th at the university of minnesota norman thomas 6 times candidate for president on the socialist party ticket said if barry goldwater became president .
YOU1000000101_S0000184	he would stop the advance of socialism in the united states i think that is exactly what he will do
YOU1000000101_S0000186	but as a former democrat i can tell you norman thomas is not the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration
YOU1000000101_S0000187	because back in 1936 mister democrat himself al smith a great american came before the american people
YOU1000000101_S0000188	and charged that the leadership of his party was taking the party of jefferson jackson and cleveland down the road under the banners of marx lenin and stalin
YOU1000000101_S0000189	and he walked away from his party and he never returned till the day he died
YOU1000000101_S0000190	because to this day the leadership of that party has been taking that party that honorable party down the road in the image of the labor socialist party of england
YOU1000000101_S0000191	now it does not require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people
YOU1000000101_S0000192	what does it mean whether you hold the deed to the or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death
YOU1000000101_S0000193	over that business or property and such machinery already exists
YOU1000000101_S0000194	the government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute every businessman has his own tale of harassment
YOU1000000101_S0000195	somewhere a perversion has taken place our natural unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government
YOU1000000101_S0000196	and freedom has never been so fragile so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment
YOU1000000101_S0000197	our democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues they want to make you and i believe that this is a contest between 2 men
YOU1000000101_S0000198	that were to choose just between 2 personalities well what of this man that they would destroy
YOU1000000101_S0000199	and in destroying they would destroy that which he represents the ideas that you and i hold dear
YOU1000000101_S0000201	is he the brash and shallow and trigger happy man they say he is
YOU1000000101_S0000202	well i have been privileged to know him when i knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office
YOU1000000101_S0000203	and i can tell you personally i have never known a man in my life i believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing
YOU1000000101_S0000205	this is a man who in his own business before he entered politics instituted a profit sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it
YOU1000000101_S0000206	he put in health and medical insurance for all his employees he took 50% of the profits before taxes
YOU1000000101_S0000207	and set up a retirement program a pension plan for all his employees
YOU1000000101_S0000208	he sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and could not work he provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores
YOU1000000101_S0000210	when mexico was ravaged by the floods in the rio grande he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there
YOU1000000101_S0000211	an ex gi told me how he met him
YOU1000000101_S0000212	it was the week before christmas during the korean war and he was at the los angeles airport trying to get a ride home to arizona for christmas
YOU1000000101_S0000214	and he said that a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes
YOU1000000101_S0000215	and then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said any men in uniform wanting a ride to arizona go to runway such and such
YOU1000000101_S0000216	and they went down there there was a fellow named barry goldwater sitting in his plane
YOU1000000101_S0000217	every day in those weeks before christmas all day long he would load up the plane fly it to arizona fly them to their homes fly back over to get another load
YOU1000000101_S0000219	during the hectic split 2nd timing of a campaign this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer
YOU1000000101_S0000220	his campaign managers were understandably impatient but he said there are not many left who care what happens to her i would like her to know i care
YOU1000000101_S0000221	this is a man who said to his 19 year old son there is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness
YOU1000000101_S0000222	and when you begin to build your life on that rock with the cement of the faith in god that you have then you have a real start
YOU1000000101_S0000224	this is not a man who could carelessly send other people is sons to war
YOU1000000101_S0000226	and that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems i have discussed academic unless we realize we are in a war that must be won
YOU1000000101_S0000228	those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory they call their policy accommodation
YOU1000000101_S0000229	and they say if we will only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us
YOU1000000101_S0000230	all who oppose them are indicted as warmongers they say we offer simple answers to complex problems
YOU1000000101_S0000231	well perhaps there is a simple answer not an easy answer but simple if you and i have the courage to tell our elected officials .
YOU1000000101_S0000232	that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right we cannot buy our security our freedom from the threat of the bomb
YOU1000000101_S0000234	by committing an immorality so great as saying to a 10 human beings now enslaved behind the iron curtain give up your dreams of freedom
YOU1000000101_S0000235	because to save our own skins we are willing to make a deal with your slave masters
YOU1000000101_S0000236	alexander hamilton said a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
YOU1000000101_S0000237	now let us set the record straight there is no argument over the choice between peace and war
YOU1000000101_S0000238	but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace and you can have it in the next 2nd surrender
YOU1000000101_S0000239	admittedly there is a risk in any course we follow other than this but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement
YOU1000000101_S0000240	and this is the specter our well meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is appeasement
YOU1000000101_S0000241	and it gives no choice between peace and war only between fight or surrender
YOU1000000101_S0000242	if we continue to accommodate continue to back and retreat eventually we have to face the final demand the ultimatum and what then
YOU1000000101_S0000243	when nikita khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be
YOU1000000101_S0000244	he has told them that we are retreating under the pressure of the cold war and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum
YOU1000000101_S0000245	our surrender will be voluntary because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually morally and economically
YOU1000000101_S0000246	he believes this because from our side he is heard voices pleading for peace at any price or better revved than dead
YOU1000000101_S0000247	or as one commentator put it he would rather live on his knees than die on his feet and therein lies the road to war because those voices do not speak for the rest of us
YOU1000000101_S0000248	you and i know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery
YOU1000000101_S0000249	if nothing in life is worth dying for when did this begin just in the face of this enemy or should moses have told the children of israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs
YOU1000000101_S0000251	should christ have refused the cross should the patriots at concord bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard round the world
YOU1000000101_S0000253	the martyrs of history were not fools and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the nazis did not die in vain
YOU1000000101_S0000255	where then is the road to peace well it is a simple answer after all
YOU1000000101_S0000256	you and i have the courage to say to our enemies there is a price we will not pay there is a point beyond which they must not advance
YOU1000000101_S0000258	and this .
YOU1000000101_S0000260	this is the meaning in the phrase of barry goldwater peace through strength
YOU1000000101_S0000261	winston churchill said the destiny of man is not measured by material computations when great forces are on the move in the world we learn we are spirits not animals
YOU1000000101_S0000262	and he said there is something going on in time and space and beyond time and space which whether we like it or not spells duty
YOU1000000101_S0000263	you and i have a rendezvous with destiny we will preserve for our children this the last best hope of man on earth
YOU1000000101_S0000264	or we will sentence them to take the last step into a 1000 years of darkness
YOU1000000101_S0000265	we will keep in mind and remember that barry goldwater has faith in us he has faith that you and i have the ability and the dignity and the right
YOU1000000101_S0000266	to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny thank you very much

YOU1000000102_S0000003	it now gives me great pleasure to introduce this year is commencement speaker steve jobs
YOU1000000102_S0000005	the chief executive officer and co founder of apple and pixar animation studios
YOU1000000102_S0000007	stanford university has been characterized since its founding by a willingness to be bold and to strike out in new directions
YOU1000000102_S0000008	and this is a characteristic very much shared by today is speaker a pioneer and visionary
YOU1000000102_S0000009	for almost 3 decades his name and the companies he has founded have been synonymous with innovation and creativity
YOU1000000102_S0000010	as a young boy growing up in los altos steve jobs came of age at the same time as silicon valley
YOU1000000102_S0000012	while still in school he attended lectures informally at stanford as well as at hewlett packard where he spent a summer working
YOU1000000102_S0000013	after graduating from high school he left california to attend reed college
YOU1000000102_S0000014	a trek through india and a short stint as a video game designer for atari followed
YOU1000000102_S0000016	soon after his return to the valley in 1974
YOU1000000102_S0000017	he became a regular along with steve wozniak at meetings of the homebrew computer club
YOU1000000102_S0000018	held at the stanford linear accelerator center it was not long before the 2 of them had built the prototype for the apple i
YOU1000000102_S0000019	the apple one was very fast at the time reading and writing 4 kilobytes in about 20 seconds
YOU1000000102_S0000021	about 20000 times slower than we do so today
YOU1000000102_S0000023	the apple ii was faster still but more importantly introduced color monitors into the home market
YOU1000000102_S0000024	in the mid 1980s the macintosh became the 1st truly user friendly personal computer
YOU1000000102_S0000025	you did not have to be an expert to set it up or to load software
YOU1000000102_S0000026	or to transfer information between applications and the mouse offered and click convenience
YOU1000000102_S0000027	and open the door to computer literacy for everyone
YOU1000000102_S0000028	i still remember the amazed faces of onlookers

YOU1000000102_S0000035	ipod and itunes have changed the way we listen to organize store and purchase our music
YOU1000000102_S0000036	and in my case the way i often read books
YOU1000000102_S0000037	now songs we love are just ¢99 and a completely legal click away
YOU1000000102_S0000039	iphoto and imovie revolutionized the ability of consumers to organize edit and display digital photography and video
YOU1000000102_S0000040	putting capabilities that once cost 1000s of dollars into the hands of every mac user
YOU1000000102_S0000041	steve is also widely recognized for his ability to create an innovative environment inside apple as well as an external company image that is equally innovative
YOU1000000102_S0000042	just think about apple is marketing campaigns over the past 3 decades a promotional flyer in 1976
YOU1000000102_S0000043	showed isaac newton sitting under a tree just as an apple was falling by
YOU1000000102_S0000044	with the catchy exhortation to bite b y t e into an apple
YOU1000000102_S0000046	there was an iconic super bowl commercial
YOU1000000102_S0000048	techie humor
YOU1000000102_S0000050	an iconic super bowl commercial telling us that the macintosh was on the horizon
YOU1000000102_S0000051	and assuring us that we would see why 1984 would not be like 1984
YOU1000000102_S0000052	and in the late 1990s we saw banners and billboards
YOU1000000102_S0000053	featuring pablo picasso albert einstein martha graham and mahatma gandhi all urging us to think different
YOU1000000102_S0000055	steve jobs understands that creativity and innovation start by thinking differently
YOU1000000102_S0000057	he has a deep rooted belief in the power of education to transform lives coupled with the desire to make the world a better place
YOU1000000102_S0000059	from the earliest days of apple he worked to develop partnerships with educators and get computers into schools

YOU1000000102_S0000064	more than 100 years ago in describing his vision for a new university leland stanford wrote
YOU1000000102_S0000065	the imagination needs to be cultivated and developed to assure success in life
YOU1000000102_S0000067	stanford clearly understood that technical knowledge was only the starting point for creation and discovery
YOU1000000102_S0000068	steve jobs understands that the computer is a very powerful tool in a technical sense
YOU1000000102_S0000069	but that its true power lies in the ability to unleash the imagination and creativity of the user
YOU1000000102_S0000071	as he explained to the new york times in a 1997 interview the macintosh turned out so well
YOU1000000102_S0000072	because the people working on it were musicians artists poets and historians
YOU1000000102_S0000073	who also happen to be excellent computer scientists
YOU1000000102_S0000075	and last fall a businessweek reporter asked how he manages for innovation
YOU1000000102_S0000076	his answer was deceptively simple we hire people who want to make the best things in the world
YOU1000000102_S0000078	steve jobs personifies the spirit and creativity that have characterized this university since its founding 114 years ago
YOU1000000102_S0000079	and we are pleased to have him here today please join me in warmly welcoming this year is commencement speaker steve joss
YOU1000000102_S0000081	i am honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world
YOU1000000102_S0000083	truth be told
YOU1000000102_S0000085	i never graduated from college and this is the closest i have ever gotten to a college graduation
YOU1000000102_S0000087	today i want to tell you 3 stories from my life that is it no big deal just 3 stories
YOU1000000102_S0000089	the 1st story is about connecting the dots
YOU1000000102_S0000091	i dropped out of reed college after the 1st 6 months but then stayed around as a drop in for another 18 months or so before i really quit
YOU1000000102_S0000093	so why would i drop out
YOU1000000102_S0000095	it started before i was born
YOU1000000102_S0000097	my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption
YOU1000000102_S0000098	she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife
YOU1000000102_S0000100	except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl
YOU1000000102_S0000102	so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we have got an unexpected baby boy do you want him
YOU1000000102_S0000103	they said of course
YOU1000000102_S0000105	my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school
YOU1000000102_S0000106	she refused to sign the final adoption papers
YOU1000000102_S0000108	she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life
YOU1000000102_S0000110	and 17 years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford
YOU1000000102_S0000111	and all of my working class parents savings were being spent on my college tuition after 6 months i could not see the value in it
YOU1000000102_S0000112	i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out
YOU1000000102_S0000113	and here i was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life
YOU1000000102_S0000115	so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made
YOU1000000102_S0000117	the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that did not interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting
YOU1000000102_S0000119	it was not all romantic i did not have a dorm room so i slept on the floor in friends rooms i returned coke bottles for the ¢5 deposits to buy food with
YOU1000000102_S0000120	and i would walk the 7 miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hare krishna temple
YOU1000000102_S0000122	i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example
YOU1000000102_S0000124	reed college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country
YOU1000000102_S0000125	throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out
YOU1000000102_S0000126	and did not have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about serif and sans serif typefaces
YOU1000000102_S0000127	about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great
YOU1000000102_S0000129	it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science can not capture and i found it fascinating
YOU1000000102_S0000131	none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life
YOU1000000102_S0000133	but 10 years later when we were designing the 1st macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac
YOU1000000102_S0000134	it was the 1st computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college
YOU1000000102_S0000135	the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac it is likely that no personal computer would have them
YOU1000000102_S0000137	if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do
YOU1000000102_S0000138	of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards 10 years later
YOU1000000102_S0000139	again you can not connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future
YOU1000000102_S0000140	you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect
YOU1000000102_S0000141	down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path and that will make all the difference
YOU1000000102_S0000143	my 2nd story is about love and loss
YOU1000000102_S0000145	i was lucky i found what i love to do early in life waz and i started apple in my parents garage when i was 20 we worked hard
YOU1000000102_S0000146	and in 10 years apple had grown from just the 2 of us in a garage into a $20 company with over 4000 employees
YOU1000000102_S0000147	we just released our finest creation the macintosh a year earlier and i just turned 30
YOU1000000102_S0000149	and then i got fired
YOU1000000102_S0000151	how can you get fired from a company you started
YOU1000000102_S0000153	well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the 1st year or so things went well
YOU1000000102_S0000154	but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at 30 i was out
YOU1000000102_S0000155	and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating
YOU1000000102_S0000157	i really did not know what to do for a few months i felt that i had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me
YOU1000000102_S0000158	i met with david packard and bob noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly
YOU1000000102_S0000160	i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did
YOU1000000102_S0000162	the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit i had been rejected but i was still in love
YOU1000000102_S0000164	and so i decided to start over
YOU1000000102_S0000166	i did not see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me
YOU1000000102_S0000167	the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life
YOU1000000102_S0000168	during the next 5 years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife
YOU1000000102_S0000169	pixar went on to create the world is 1st computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world
YOU1000000102_S0000171	in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed at next is at the heart of apple is current renaissance
YOU1000000102_S0000172	and lorene and i have a wonderful family together
YOU1000000102_S0000174	i am pretty sure none of this would have happened if i had not been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it
YOU1000000102_S0000176	sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick do not lose faith
YOU1000000102_S0000178	i am convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did you have got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers
YOU1000000102_S0000179	your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work
YOU1000000102_S0000180	and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you have not found it yet keep looking
YOU1000000102_S0000182	and do not settle as with all matters of the heart you will know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better
YOU1000000102_S0000183	as the years roll on so keep looking do not settle
YOU1000000102_S0000185	my 3rd story is about death
YOU1000000102_S0000187	when i was 17 i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday you will most certainly be right
YOU1000000102_S0000189	it made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years i have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself
YOU1000000102_S0000190	if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row
YOU1000000102_S0000191	i know i need to change something
YOU1000000102_S0000193	remembering that i will be dead soon is the most important tool i have ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything
YOU1000000102_S0000194	all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important
YOU1000000102_S0000195	remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked
YOU1000000102_S0000196	there is no reason not to follow your heart
YOU1000000102_S0000198	about a year ago i was diagnosed with cancer
YOU1000000102_S0000200	i had a scan at 7.30 in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas i did not even know what a pancreas was
YOU1000000102_S0000201	the doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that i should expect to live no longer than 3 to 6 months
YOU1000000102_S0000203	my doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order which is doctor is code for prepare to die
YOU1000000102_S0000204	it means to try and tell your kids everything
YOU1000000102_S0000206	you thought you would have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months it means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that will be as easy as possible for your family
YOU1000000102_S0000207	it means to say your goodbyes
YOU1000000102_S0000209	i live with that diagnosis all day later that evening i had a biopsy where they stuck an endoscope down my throat through my stomach and into my intestines
YOU1000000102_S0000210	put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor i was sedated but my wife who was there told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope
YOU1000000102_S0000211	the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery
YOU1000000102_S0000212	i had the surgery and thankfully i am fine now
YOU1000000102_S0000214	this was the closest i have been to facing death and i hope it is the closest i get for a few more decades having lived through it
YOU1000000102_S0000215	i can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept
YOU1000000102_S0000217	no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven do not want to die to get there
YOU1000000102_S0000219	and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be
YOU1000000102_S0000220	because death is very likely the single best invention of life it is life is change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new
YOU1000000102_S0000222	right now the new is you
YOU1000000102_S0000224	but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
YOU1000000102_S0000226	sorry to be so dramatic but it is quite true
YOU1000000102_S0000228	your time is limited so do not waste it living someone else is life do not be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people is thinking
YOU1000000102_S0000229	do not let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition
YOU1000000102_S0000230	they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary
YOU1000000102_S0000232	when i was young there was an amazing publication called the whole earth catalog which was one of the bibles of my generation
YOU1000000102_S0000233	it was created by a fellow named stuart brand not far from here in menlo park and he brought it to life with his poetic touch
YOU1000000102_S0000234	this was in the late 60s before personal computers and desktop publishing so it was all made with typewriters scissors and polaroid cameras
YOU1000000102_S0000235	it was sort of like google in paperback form 35 years before google came along it was idealistic overflowing with neat tools and great notions
YOU1000000102_S0000237	stewart and his team put out several issues of the whole earth catalog and then when it had run its course they put out a final issue
YOU1000000102_S0000238	it was the mid 1970s and i was your age
YOU1000000102_S0000240	on the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road
YOU1000000102_S0000242	the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous beneath it were the words stay hungry stay foolish
YOU1000000102_S0000243	it was their farewell message as they signed off stay hungry stay foolish and i have always wished that for myself
YOU1000000102_S0000245	and now as you graduate to begin anew i wish that for you stay hungry stay foolish thank you all very much

YOU1000000105_S0000043	and i said it in my speech and i will say it again if you work hard and you do not give up you can do anything
YOU1000000105_S0000045	i can tell you i know you put a lot of work into everything you do and that performance that you and bradley gave that was really one of the great performances in the history of the oscars
YOU1000000105_S0000046	thank you
YOU1000000105_S0000047	it was like i mean you know we were watching it at home we are like 0 my what is going on between these 2
YOU1000000105_S0000048	and did you feel like it did to pete well i know it caused this big controversy because it was such an emote you had such a connection with bradley that instantly
YOU1000000105_S0000049	and i guess this is a compliment people started saying like 0 they must be in love
YOU1000000105_S0000051	1st of all like like social media quite frankly is the toilet of the internet
YOU1000000105_S0000052	yes it is
YOU1000000105_S0000053	and what it has done to pop culture is just like abysmal and and and yes people saw love and guess what that is
YOU1000000105_S0000054	that is what we wanted you to see
YOU1000000105_S0000055	yes
YOU1000000105_S0000056	i mean this is a love song shallow the movie a star is born it is a love story we worked so hard
YOU1000000105_S0000057	we worked all week on that performance bradley who you know i like never relinquish control about a live stage performance i have done a 10 of them
YOU1000000105_S0000058	but he directed this film and he directed all of obviously the musical moments in the film
YOU1000000105_S0000059	and he directed obviously shallow the moment in the film so i knew that he had the vision for how it should go
YOU1000000105_S0000060	and so i was like you know what do you think bradley and he gave me he laid it all out i mean everything that you saw the way that it was shot
YOU1000000105_S0000061	the way that they push the piano out you saw them you know but but the piano together and
YOU1000000105_S0000062	no intro
YOU1000000105_S0000063	up on stage no intro all of it that was all him and he even also was the one that was like i think that the audience should be lit you know so that we are not just lit the audience is lit
YOU1000000105_S0000064	so then i called roy bennett who i work with and he does my lighting and i am like we need to light the entire room with amber lights because bradley wants honeycomb and we have got to give him what he wants
YOU1000000105_S0000065	and you know it was just great and from a performance perspective it was so important to both of us that we were connected the entire time
YOU1000000105_S0000066	look i have had my arms wrapped around tony bennett for 3 years touring the world
YOU1000000105_S0000068	when you are singing love songs that is what you want people to feel
YOU1000000105_S0000069	are you having an affair with tony bennett be honest
YOU1000000105_S0000071	no no i am an artist and i guess we did a good job and full job
YOU1000000105_S0000072	i know yeah you did a very good job
YOU1000000105_S0000074	bradley did a great job i have known him for a long time and the idea of i mean it is one thing to go on stage and sing on the oscars that is terrifying just to start
YOU1000000105_S0000075	but then to sing with you and to you know be trading lines with you in a movie you can pick and choose but you are on live television was he terrified
YOU1000000105_S0000076	no
YOU1000000105_S0000077	no
YOU1000000105_S0000078	because we practiced and we worked hard you know bradley is a musician i mean .
YOU1000000105_S0000079	my favorite thing about the whole experience was i was just so excited for people not only at home but you know our peers in the room to see him sing live
YOU1000000105_S0000080	to see that he can sing live
YOU1000000105_S0000081	saying every take in this movie live every single time i mean all of it
YOU1000000105_S0000082	there was no lip sync and i was so excited and i was in the moment but when we started and he starts singing tell me something girl
YOU1000000105_S0000083	the whole audience started cheering and i was like yes bradley yes they love it keep going we have got this you know it was great
YOU1000000105_S0000084	so if you were acting you could have that same connection with me if we were singing that song
YOU1000000105_S0000086	yeah

YOU1000000108_S0000021	and it always happens around a time in their career where it seems as though they are crossing over the next plateau
YOU1000000108_S0000022	yeah yeah would you say you lost your mind sort of
YOU1000000108_S0000024	no
YOU1000000108_S0000025	no
YOU1000000108_S0000026	not exactly
YOU1000000108_S0000027	ok
YOU1000000108_S0000028	i was not crazy but it is incredibly stressful
YOU1000000108_S0000029	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000030	and i feel like in a lot of instances i was deliberately being put through stress because you know when you are a guy that generates money .
YOU1000000108_S0000031	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000032	people have a vested interest in controlling
YOU1000000108_S0000033	yeah were they trying to control you because you know i read the time magazine article and they were quoted as saying you had extreme creative control
YOU1000000108_S0000034	and that you really ran your own show
YOU1000000108_S0000035	yeah ok well oprah i did 2 very successful seasons before that so why all of a sudden on the 3rd time am i in africa by myself like what is happening
YOU1000000108_S0000036	yeah so what happened did you find yourself spiraling
YOU1000000108_S0000038	downward
YOU1000000108_S0000039	1st of all yeah but
YOU1000000108_S0000041	i do not want to make it as a thing where i am absolving myself of any responsibility
YOU1000000108_S0000042	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000043	obviously i am partially responsible you know a lot of it has to do with me
YOU1000000108_S0000045	was there a tipping point for you
YOU1000000108_S0000046	i will give you an example the 1st season ends
YOU1000000108_S0000047	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000048	and in the middle of the seasons there was a renegotiation
YOU1000000108_S0000049	okay
YOU1000000108_S0000050	ultimately through a series of events and a little pressure i ended up settling for way less than what i wanted
YOU1000000108_S0000052	and going forward and then in season 2
YOU1000000108_S0000054	the dvds released and it sets all these incredible records turns out the back
YOU1000000108_S0000055	20 in one day
YOU1000000108_S0000056	right
YOU1000000108_S0000057	120 in a week the largest selling television dvd of all time
YOU1000000108_S0000058	yeah yeah so now suddenly suddenly this is a bigger money making they thought was already making money but now i said it is a whole new revenue stream
YOU1000000108_S0000059	and my contract is up
YOU1000000108_S0000060	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000062	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000063	you know so we finished the season so now you know the show is
YOU1000000108_S0000065	gaining popularity ratings up every week i am the toast of the town
YOU1000000108_S0000066	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000067	and .
YOU1000000108_S0000069	when the season starts ending you know you get the question so dave what are you going to do and i knew it would be real tight lipped about it
YOU1000000108_S0000070	you know it was not like comedy central was a hot place to be when i showed up there
YOU1000000108_S0000071	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000073	but you turned it around your show turn it around became the most popular
YOU1000000108_S0000074	that is what i was thinking
YOU1000000108_S0000075	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000077	yeah yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000078	you know so and this is the thing we have all these arguments david got cut the poop joke and there was a lot of discussion about we know what our audience wants
YOU1000000108_S0000079	i was like yeah whatever and i mean they were wrong 100% of the time
YOU1000000108_S0000080	huh
YOU1000000108_S0000081	as far as what people would like
YOU1000000108_S0000082	ok
YOU1000000108_S0000083	and the show is an incredibly hard show to do that is the other thing
YOU1000000108_S0000085	the pell show was a .
YOU1000000108_S0000087	i mean it is fun and all these things but there is a tremendous amount of work that goes into making a show like that
YOU1000000108_S0000088	yeah people were saying though that you were on drugs you lost your mind you went into a mental institution what is true what is not
YOU1000000108_S0000089	not on drugs
YOU1000000108_S0000090	not on drugs
YOU1000000108_S0000091	nah not for years
YOU1000000108_S0000092	okay
YOU1000000108_S0000093	i am not on drugs

YOU1000000108_S0000095	no no not at all not at all i am telling you i was incredibly stressed out
YOU1000000108_S0000096	you know love is like a nutrient
YOU1000000108_S0000098	and i was deficient on vitamin love
YOU1000000108_S0000099	really
YOU1000000108_S0000101	were you really
YOU1000000108_S0000103	now really what was going on
YOU1000000108_S0000104	man where do you start
YOU1000000108_S0000106	damn this story
YOU1000000108_S0000108	i do not know
YOU1000000108_S0000110	i was doing sketches
YOU1000000108_S0000112	that were funny
YOU1000000108_S0000114	but socially irresponsible
YOU1000000108_S0000115	
YOU1000000108_S0000116	i felt like i was deliberately being encouraged and i was overwhelmed
YOU1000000108_S0000117	it is like you are getting flooded with things and you do not pay attention to things like your ethics
YOU1000000108_S0000118	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000119	or when you get so overwhelmed it was like you would won the lottery
YOU1000000108_S0000120	explain
YOU1000000108_S0000121	let us say for your handlers for instance
YOU1000000108_S0000122	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000123	a lot of these people traditionally get paid on percentage basis the more you work .
YOU1000000108_S0000124	the more they make
YOU1000000108_S0000125	the more they make
YOU1000000108_S0000126	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000127	you make that real money
YOU1000000108_S0000129	they lost their minds i thought they were crazy
YOU1000000108_S0000130	huh
YOU1000000108_S0000131	you know it was like you got to do everything
YOU1000000108_S0000132	yeah yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000133	so i got all these things and i got you know your own personal problems that get inflamed when this kind of money comes in
YOU1000000108_S0000134	and i got to write a show and do the show and i was overwhelmed
YOU1000000108_S0000136	and it was almost like
YOU1000000108_S0000138	i do not know it was almost as if this was happening deliberately
YOU1000000108_S0000139	ok you mentioned a moment ago that you felt that there were some things that were not socially responsible like what
YOU1000000108_S0000141	like there is this one sketch we did that was about this pixie that would appear whenever racist things happens whenever someone make you feel like .
YOU1000000108_S0000142	they calling you that n word
YOU1000000108_S0000143	huh
YOU1000000108_S0000144	but do not say it and it was funny and the premise of the sketch was that every race had this like pixie this like racial conflict
YOU1000000108_S0000146	and the
YOU1000000108_S0000148	but the pixie was in blackface now
YOU1000000108_S0000150	blackface is a very difficult image but the reason i had chosen blackface at the time was because this was going to be the visual personification of the inward
YOU1000000108_S0000151	it was a good spirit or intention behind it
YOU1000000108_S0000153	but what i did not consider is how many people watch the show
YOU1000000108_S0000155	and how the way people use television is subjective
YOU1000000108_S0000156	i completely understand
YOU1000000108_S0000157	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000158	i could finish because i have a story to tell you
YOU1000000108_S0000159	so then when i am on the set and we are finally taping the sketch
YOU1000000108_S0000161	somebody on set that was white laughed in such a way i know the difference of people laughing with me and people laughing at me
YOU1000000108_S0000163	and was the 1st time i would ever gotten a laugh that i was uncomfortable with
YOU1000000108_S0000164	
YOU1000000108_S0000165	not just uncomfortable but like should i fire this person
YOU1000000108_S0000167	.
YOU1000000108_S0000169	and at the same time i am just not a naturally assertive person
YOU1000000108_S0000170	what was it about the laugh
YOU1000000108_S0000172	i know all these people who be watching tv
YOU1000000108_S0000174	that there is a lot of people who will understand exactly what i am doing
YOU1000000108_S0000176	then there is another group of people who are just fans like the people that the kind of people that scream i am rick james be at my concerts
YOU1000000108_S0000177	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000178	that this is a long for a different kind of celebrity worship rat they are going to get something .
YOU1000000108_S0000180	completely different
YOU1000000108_S0000181	completely different
YOU1000000108_S0000182	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000183	they are concerned
YOU1000000108_S0000184	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000185	i do not want black people to be disappointed in me for putting that out there
YOU1000000108_S0000186	no you do not want to be disappointed in yourself
YOU1000000108_S0000188	you know what hope
YOU1000000108_S0000190	you are right
YOU1000000108_S0000191	i still have not gotten to why you just disappeared so you had that moment the guy is laughing too much was that the tipping point for you was that the straw
YOU1000000108_S0000192	that was the 1st tipping point
YOU1000000108_S0000193	ok
YOU1000000108_S0000194	i did not even put in the paper that i had pneumonia or god knows what
YOU1000000108_S0000195	
YOU1000000108_S0000196	it was walking pneumonia because i was walking all over the place
YOU1000000108_S0000198	i was relaxing
YOU1000000108_S0000200	and then after that i was coming back to the show
YOU1000000108_S0000201	and then they were like well dave you should just back up the pneumonia story and i was like that was your thing i am not backing up a pneumonia story
YOU1000000108_S0000203	and then the next day it was in the paper that i had writer is block then i knew something was getting ready to get stressful because i had not even started writing i was on schedule to write so i was like what is .
YOU1000000108_S0000204	you know what is going on are they going to .
YOU1000000108_S0000205	so these are your people trying to feed
YOU1000000108_S0000206	manipulate me sounds like somebody is trying to put young dave in a compromising position
YOU1000000108_S0000208	
YOU1000000108_S0000209	but you know okay so then i got worried so when i said i am not going to do it then all of a sudden it was like well now he has walking pneumonia and then i knew long before i walked i had considered walking
YOU1000000108_S0000210	you had considered
YOU1000000108_S0000211	i went back to work and the vitamin love was gone because it was a real ugly negotiation
YOU1000000108_S0000212	it is a situation where now everybody is taking credit for this and that and the other so it is just it was getting ridiculous and i knew i was going to leave so i got ahead of schedule and i bounced
YOU1000000108_S0000213	and i did not tell anybody where i was going
YOU1000000108_S0000215	the whole time they are trying to convince me i am insane
YOU1000000108_S0000217	they were trying to get me to take psychotic medication
YOU1000000108_S0000219	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000221	like i am sitting around you know i was stressed out but the people that were telling me i was insane i believe that they knew what was going on
YOU1000000108_S0000223	so this was troublesome
YOU1000000108_S0000224	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000226	i am not taking this medicine man because i know these people be trying to control you or maybe discredit you i was afraid like you know
YOU1000000108_S0000227	but you were stressed out
YOU1000000108_S0000228	there is no question but it is very stressful for someone to constantly walk behind you and say you are insane
YOU1000000108_S0000229	0 hey how about this i show up to work the 1st week and they where my office used to be they built a wall there
YOU1000000108_S0000231	why
YOU1000000108_S0000232	i did not know why
YOU1000000108_S0000234	but it came out later that they were like well they said you wanted it i do not want to be walled up in the office
YOU1000000108_S0000235	i like hanging out and talking
YOU1000000108_S0000236	ok so you got up and you walked out and nobody knew where you were going did your family know
YOU1000000108_S0000238	nah well nah i call my brother
YOU1000000108_S0000239	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000240	me and my brother real cool i called him up was like i am going to africa he was like cool man it is good
YOU1000000108_S0000241	did your wife and children know where you are going
YOU1000000108_S0000242	now
YOU1000000108_S0000243	no nobody knew
YOU1000000108_S0000244	now i bounce
YOU1000000108_S0000246	now that sounds a little crazy
YOU1000000108_S0000247	it is not crazy because the situation kind of warranted it
YOU1000000108_S0000248	ok
YOU1000000108_S0000249	because certain people around me were putting my sanity in question i would meet too much obstruction if i was to say i am doing something like that
YOU1000000108_S0000250	yeah ok
YOU1000000108_S0000251	so i figured it was not that i did not tell my wife it was like i am not telling her till after i am gone which was a mistake
YOU1000000108_S0000252	but it was not a crazy mistake it is just a dude
YOU1000000108_S0000253	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000255	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000256	it is just like that as a husband she should have known where you were going is that what you are saying
YOU1000000108_S0000257	she was going to know i well you know i basically i called my brother i told and i gave him a list you call so and so so and so so and so and i took off
YOU1000000108_S0000259	then i call my wife
YOU1000000108_S0000260	ok why were you going to africa specifically
YOU1000000108_S0000261	one i needed a break
YOU1000000108_S0000262	need a break
YOU1000000108_S0000263	2 we have family friends down there and 3 i just felt like it was a place where i could really
YOU1000000108_S0000265	reflect it is just a place that i got to go
YOU1000000108_S0000266	and what did you conclude about yourself
YOU1000000108_S0000268	0 well that i was not paying attention i felt really guilty about being asleep at the wheel
YOU1000000108_S0000270	i felt guilty about it because .
YOU1000000108_S0000272	i forgot the hostility of the environment of show business
YOU1000000108_S0000274	it is not a docile environment it is a challenging environment
YOU1000000108_S0000275	yes
YOU1000000108_S0000276	you know and there is some quote that someone had told me it says success takes you where character cannot sustain you
YOU1000000108_S0000277	wow that is a good quote
YOU1000000108_S0000278	i do not care who you think you are or how you think you do it you cannot imagine
YOU1000000108_S0000280	what celebrities go through
YOU1000000108_S0000282	as far as how your integrity and your self image and all these things
YOU1000000108_S0000283	ok this is a theory that i have always had and i have discussed this with other people the idea that if you do not know who you are when this big thing hits when the big stuff comes
YOU1000000108_S0000284	if you do not know who you are and can not stand in the center of yourself then you end up confused and feeling thwarted and feeling diffused in many directions
YOU1000000108_S0000285	because everybody is pulling on you would you say that that was part of your issue trying to figure out find the center for yourself
YOU1000000108_S0000286	absolutely
YOU1000000108_S0000287	when you are suddenly given a $50 contract when you have been making i do not know what before that is a lot to orchestrate to handle and a lot for other people to figure out
YOU1000000108_S0000288	0 in that sense it was like all right you are the ceo of a $50 company good luck
YOU1000000108_S0000289	yeah yeah now you figure it out
YOU1000000108_S0000290	right
YOU1000000108_S0000291	but you have worked your whole life for it you wanted it
YOU1000000108_S0000293	you know struggled to get it sacrifice sacrifice rejected many times told that things would not work would not work would not work and then all of a sudden you are the genius
YOU1000000108_S0000294	and we are going to give you $50 and that was too much for you to handle
YOU1000000108_S0000296	no that is the thing that i always read that makes me mad no it was the fame could not stand the fame
YOU1000000108_S0000297	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000298	i love being famous
YOU1000000108_S0000299	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000301	it is phenomenal i came out here and everybody was like hooray i was like i am back on tv
YOU1000000108_S0000303	ok so that is clear it is not the fame it is what
YOU1000000108_S0000304	it is the way the people around you position themselves around you to get in your pockets and in your mind
YOU1000000108_S0000305	yeah yeah yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000306	that is infuriating to me
YOU1000000108_S0000307	you know one of the phrases i always loved is too much is given much is expected and part of it is
YOU1000000108_S0000308	i know i am like spider man peter with great power comes great responsibility
YOU1000000108_S0000309	no no no but it does it does and part of that is not just being up on stage
YOU1000000108_S0000311	it is handling the rest of the business and handling all the people that are lined up at your door for whatever reason
YOU1000000108_S0000312	yeah yeah you are absolutely right
YOU1000000108_S0000313	do not get to $50 with no strings attached
YOU1000000108_S0000314	yeah but at a certain point it was like all right this is enough
YOU1000000108_S0000315	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000316	colleagues were quoted as saying that you had become increasingly paranoid would you say you were paranoid
YOU1000000108_S0000317	sure 1st of all what is a black man without his paranoia intact
YOU1000000108_S0000319	if you get .
YOU1000000108_S0000321	you might win $100 in a poker game and be on the subway you are going to look over your shoulder
YOU1000000108_S0000323	they just said in everything i had $50 that is like making me a mark mann
YOU1000000108_S0000324	so did you go to a psychiatric hospital
YOU1000000108_S0000325	in south africa
YOU1000000108_S0000326	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000327	0

YOU1000000108_S0000340	yeah

YOU1000000108_S0000343	and just running with it it was on everything
YOU1000000108_S0000344	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000345	that is a fact
YOU1000000108_S0000346	yeah
YOU1000000108_S0000347	subscribe to the own channel today and we will see you on youtube
YOU1000000109_S0000000	a little over 3 minutes plus additional time ramonic
YOU1000000109_S0000002	as so often portugal is hopes rest on cristiano ronaldo is shoulders
YOU1000000109_S0000004	ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000006	it is a warm indeed very humid night here in sochi there is a very tangible sense of anticipation
YOU1000000109_S0000007	it is portugal is 1st game at the 2018 fifa world cup russia cristiano ronaldo is appearing at his 4th world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000008	the 3rd in which he will catch in his country
YOU1000000109_S0000009	portugal went into the 2018 world cup as european champions they had won euro 2016 beat france to host in the final
YOU1000000109_S0000010	i think there were a lot of expectations about portugal going into the world cup that perhaps they could finally go farther than just the group stage and the round of 16
YOU1000000109_S0000011	cristiano faces the nation he has just spent the last 9 years plying his trade in spain
YOU1000000109_S0000012	i think that definitely motivated ronaldo himself a lot of those players would have been his teammates of course like real madrid
YOU1000000109_S0000013	he really wanted to leave everything on the field and that is exactly what we saw
YOU1000000109_S0000015	ronaldo is that a penalty it is
YOU1000000109_S0000016	it does not take long for cr 7 to make his march
YOU1000000109_S0000017	inside the opening 3 minutes cristiano ronaldo fouled in the penalty area
YOU1000000109_S0000018	cristiano now has the chance to score for his country from the penalty spot he has been here before
YOU1000000109_S0000021	21 year old cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000023	waits for referee poulard is whistle composes himself
YOU1000000109_S0000025	and scores
YOU1000000109_S0000027	he had been at the euros 2 years prior and they made it to the finals losing out to greece
YOU1000000109_S0000028	he was already arguably portugal is most potent attacking weapon and that was a really good portugal team
YOU1000000109_S0000029	the early noughties team that ronaldo found himself part of was a phenomenal team in terms of talent
YOU1000000109_S0000030	one reason why ronaldo did well at that tournament he was not portugal is sole focus point
YOU1000000109_S0000031	you had simao sobrosa who was doing very well of course you had luiz figo you had deco
YOU1000000109_S0000032	the netherlands game in the last 16 was obviously a brutal experience for ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000033	the netherlands tried to take him out of the game take him out of the equation and that is what they did an absolutely horrendous tackle
YOU1000000109_S0000034	that was a very scandalous game where you had 16 yellow cards you had 4 red cards i mean that was a really difficult game for both teams for cristiano that was a learning moment
YOU1000000109_S0000035	as you got older and you got fitter and more muscular if you like stronger that was probably a game you would have been able to ride more
YOU1000000109_S0000036	it was more what happened in that game against england that took all the headlines
YOU1000000109_S0000037	there is this photo of rony against ricardo carvalho
YOU1000000109_S0000038	and rooney and all the english team said that cristiano should go to the referee to say give him a red card
YOU1000000109_S0000039	and then he is walking over to the bench he gives a nice little wink and of course everybody in england understandably was very upset
YOU1000000109_S0000040	i mean definitely i think was an early sign of what was to come over the next few years in terms of cristiano ronaldo and his personality
YOU1000000109_S0000041	the england game actually ended perfectly for ronaldo despite all his controversy as he took the winning penalty in the shootout
YOU1000000109_S0000043	it is all over for england portugal go into the last 4
YOU1000000109_S0000044	they overcame them on penalties and then lost to a french team as inspired by zinedine zidane it was absolutely exceptional in that game
YOU1000000109_S0000045	and it is his world cup at the moment zinedine zidane
YOU1000000109_S0000046	portugal tried to get back into it they were quite close on a few occasions
YOU1000000109_S0000047	goes for goal bartosz can not hold it 0 what a chance missed
YOU1000000109_S0000048	that just was not to be
YOU1000000109_S0000050	cristiano ronaldo against david de gea
YOU1000000109_S0000051	it is one 0 portugal and was there ever any doubt it just had to be him
YOU1000000109_S0000052	portugal is lead only lasts 20 minutes
YOU1000000109_S0000053	pepe gets the head up and goes down play continues it is diego costa can he get the shot away costa scores
YOU1000000109_S0000055	well ronaldo is mentality is not it i think that is what makes him the player he is
YOU1000000109_S0000056	just before half time cristiano has slipped the ball on the edge of the box
YOU1000000109_S0000057	ronaldo with the shot 0 it has gone in an error from david de gea and cristiano ronaldo gets portugal is 2nd goal of the night
YOU1000000109_S0000058	portugal are back in front tonight cristiano is on a mission against spain perhaps motivated by revenge for what happened in the past
YOU1000000109_S0000062	the ronaldo of 2010 is a very very different ronaldo to the ronaldo of 2006
YOU1000000109_S0000063	between those 2 world cups he signs for real madrid he becomes the most expensive player to sign for the club and in the world at that point in time for €940
YOU1000000109_S0000064	and at that point he had become the leader and the captain of portugal
YOU1000000109_S0000065	with a room and whistle to turn for ronaldo made room for the shot 0 off the post what a strike
YOU1000000109_S0000066	he had a different manager to play under 1st he had different teammates arguably the best player in the world after winning champions league with manchester united the attention is drawn to him much more than before
YOU1000000109_S0000067	here is ronaldo no free kick
YOU1000000109_S0000068	carlos queiroz the coach had come in and fortunately for portugal it all went horribly wrong the relationship between ronaldo and queiroz was very strained
YOU1000000109_S0000069	and i think that really stemmed from the tactics employed by k raj
YOU1000000109_S0000070	his whole tactics seemed to be let us just make our team as difficult to score against as possible and our attacking sister would just be whack the ball up to ronaldo and let him work some magic on his own
YOU1000000109_S0000071	and it just did not work at all
YOU1000000109_S0000072	great opportunity here for brazil to concede
YOU1000000109_S0000073	and he scored once during that tournament it will be an excellent goal against north korea where he is sort of juggling out where he balanced the ball on the back of his neck and sort of rolled it over the top of his head and then scored
YOU1000000109_S0000074	and then it was the derby the iberian derby
YOU1000000109_S0000075	and they got knocked out to spain who at least for them a bit of comfort is knowing that they went on to win the whole tournament altogether
YOU1000000109_S0000076	and they were a fabulous spanish side nobody really could take them apart nobody could really beat them at all
YOU1000000109_S0000077	it is true that spain have a beautiful team at this time
YOU1000000109_S0000078	i think there was a lot of pressure on cristiano ronaldo to be this big figure since he was this worldwide superstar but unfortunately he came up against
YOU1000000109_S0000079	this spanish wall that he just was not able to break through
YOU1000000109_S0000080	after the game ronaldo was asked what went wrong and told the germans to ask carlos
YOU1000000109_S0000081	i think it is one world cup which you can not really blame him at all for his lack of production it was definitely just the team was not set up to get the best out of him at all
YOU1000000109_S0000082	the world cup disappointing in the finish disappointing in not scoring the goals that people expected him to score but it was the foundation for him as a player to improve on and build
YOU1000000109_S0000084	ronaldo with the shot 0 it has gone in
YOU1000000109_S0000085	8 years later and portugal are now the ones with the upper hand they lead 2 one with 45 minutes left on the clock
YOU1000000109_S0000086	cristiano ronaldo has turned this group match back in portugal is favor
YOU1000000109_S0000087	with spain applying more pressure there is not too much cristiano can do except hope his defense will hold firm
YOU1000000109_S0000088	silva with a little chip back across goal turned in diego costa strikes again
YOU1000000109_S0000089	a simple free kick move from spain and for the 2nd time tonight in sochi spain have equalized
YOU1000000109_S0000090	but then there is not much the defense can do when the ball falls to nacho
YOU1000000109_S0000091	now it might drop for the shot here 0 what a shot that is nacho the man who gave away the penalty early on in this match
YOU1000000109_S0000093	has redeemed himself in style
YOU1000000109_S0000094	thanks to a wonder strike spain have turned the game around they now lead 3 2 and it looks like history is set to repeat itself
YOU1000000109_S0000095	it seems cristiano can not shake his bad luck at the world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000097	germany lead the height of hummels the goal of hummels germany get another one and they do terrible terrible defending germany have got 4
YOU1000000109_S0000098	what a dreadful day and an awful start for portugal
YOU1000000109_S0000099	so in the way that ronaldo had progressed quite a lot between 2006 and 2010 he progressed equally a far distance between 2010 and 2014 he went into that tournament a champions league winner with real madrid ballon d or winner
YOU1000000109_S0000100	it was not a great tournament he had a lot of problems physical problems but he wanted to stay he wanted to be there
YOU1000000109_S0000101	so he decided to play through the pain and to play through the injury
YOU1000000109_S0000102	because he felt that without him they were not going to be able to advance but it did not matter in the end because it just did not work out
YOU1000000109_S0000103	germany were phenomenal in 2014 obviously went on to win the tournament but nevertheless to get beat 4 0 it was portugal is heaviest defeat at a world cup that was pretty humiliating
YOU1000000109_S0000104	portugal were really ronaldo centric at this time
YOU1000000109_S0000105	against the united states that defense they really put a clamp down and it was very difficult for him
YOU1000000109_S0000106	yedlin with the ball in bradley chance for him usa and it is a goal
YOU1000000109_S0000107	it was quite amazing actually that ronaldo managed to pull out of the bag a chance to keep their world cup alive just by the slimmest of threads virgil the last kick of the game
YOU1000000109_S0000109	unless we have a most dramatic twist in the final seconds now into the last 300 and we have it is a dream of a cross from ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000110	and varela buries it
YOU1000000109_S0000111	he was going to play until the last whistle of every game that is his mentality that is what he drives for he is not going to rest
YOU1000000109_S0000112	i think he figures you know even if i have you know my leg amputated i am going to go out there and i am going to still try and score or at least set somebody else up to score
YOU1000000109_S0000113	because he is just that focused and that determined
YOU1000000109_S0000114	the last game against ghana all sorts of permutations portugal was still in the shouter qualifying but basically they needed to win and win big
YOU1000000109_S0000115	ronaldo managed to score the goal but it was already quite near towards the end of the game
YOU1000000109_S0000116	maybe there ronaldo yes he has goal no 50 of his international career
YOU1000000109_S0000117	it was too little too late at that and the damage was done and they were not able to get out of the group and they crashed out very early on in the world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000118	in a very disappointing world cup for portugal he was probably portugal is best player
YOU1000000109_S0000119	it was probably at that moment maybe that the gap between portugal is best player i e ronaldo and the rest of the team was most exposed
YOU1000000109_S0000120	it is definitely a world cup where portugal paid a price for just not being fit enough
YOU1000000109_S0000122	ronaldo goes down gets a free kick challenges by pique now this is a key moment we know who is going to strike it
YOU1000000109_S0000123	the game approaches its final minutes cristiano stands over a free kick displaying his trademark stance
YOU1000000109_S0000124	this for his hat trick and to save portugal from defeat
YOU1000000109_S0000126	ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000128	0 genius absolute genius would you believe it
YOU1000000109_S0000129	it was a phenomenal tour everybody at that point just kind of fell out of their seats and said ok it is not spain is day we just need to accept that this is all about cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000130	you do not see those individual performances in the world cup that often
YOU1000000109_S0000131	it actually sums up ronaldo brilliant goal scored in a huge game at a critical moment
YOU1000000109_S0000132	exemplary perfection and it is a hat trick for cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000134	in their next game against morocco cristiano is fine form continues as he scores the decisive goal in a promising performance
YOU1000000109_S0000136	he is a sensation
YOU1000000109_S0000138	he would be his 85th goal in the international scene he would pass ferenc puskas
YOU1000000109_S0000139	and so he then became the highest goal scorer in europe in international football and the 2nd overall in the world
YOU1000000109_S0000140	against ir iran a quaresma wonder goal puts portugal ahead
YOU1000000109_S0000141	was cristiano is world cup luck turning at last
YOU1000000109_S0000142	this will give portugal breathing space
YOU1000000109_S0000144	ronaldo is denied
YOU1000000109_S0000146	and the game and the group are still very much alive
YOU1000000109_S0000147	cristiano is missed penalty ultimately costs portugal the top spot in their group
YOU1000000109_S0000148	which means they will face uruguay in the round of 16 a formidable opponent
YOU1000000109_S0000149	round of 16 they run into udawai which is a tough matchup because their defense is geared it is very physical really caused problems for cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000150	wall was able to deal with the considerable threat not his finest hour from a free kick suarez over on that far side and it is pinpoint
YOU1000000109_S0000152	dangerous cross given it is them again
YOU1000000109_S0000153	unfortunately for portugal they really only got going in the 2nd half when they were really backs against the wall
YOU1000000109_S0000154	adrian silva is shot the deflection for a corner
YOU1000000109_S0000155	pepe has done it
YOU1000000109_S0000157	well there is the answer they were looking for
YOU1000000109_S0000159	but they really did not do themselves justice and i think jurong gwaii were deserved winners at the end 2 brilliant goals you have to say
YOU1000000109_S0000160	fernandes 4 on 3 for a moment here cavani brilliant that is pure gold
YOU1000000109_S0000161	for the 4th time in his career cristiano ronaldo is knocked out of the world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000162	it is all over and maybe it is the end in terms of world cups for the great cristiano ronaldo
YOU1000000109_S0000163	in that world cup he showed one last time if it is the last time that he is such a prolific goal scorer that is legendary
YOU1000000109_S0000164	i think 2018 in a way sums up ronaldo is international career which is exceptionally talented a player for the big occasion but just part of a team that bar france in 2016 has never been good enough to win one of the major honors
YOU1000000109_S0000165	we do not know if that will be his last world cup i do not think it will be i think there is a very good chance that we could see him at qatar 2022 he will be 37 years old
YOU1000000109_S0000166	by the time that will cut rolls around
YOU1000000109_S0000168	ronaldo will not be portugal is sole attacking threat so you could argue that the stage is perfectly set for him as he really thrives in this world cup
YOU1000000109_S0000169	as part of an exciting attacking team as the elder statesman and perhaps put those former world cups where he did not perhaps do himself justice you know put that to rights
YOU1000000110_S0000002	and nobody in his life all force all will now for the netherlands
YOU1000000110_S0000003	saved by romero
YOU1000000110_S0000005	and who have argentina sent up 1st of course lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000007	the man for all moments
YOU1000000110_S0000009	for many on planet football the number one the man
YOU1000000110_S0000011	the 2014 fifa world cup brazil was perhaps the most important tournament in lionel messi is career
YOU1000000110_S0000013	so 2014 there was still a lot of expectation for this player who had been breaking all sorts of goal scoring records at club level
YOU1000000110_S0000014	but never truly excelled at international level
YOU1000000110_S0000017	messi made sure that their 1st match against bosnia and herzegovina went to plan
YOU1000000110_S0000018	likewise campagnolo it is a devilish delivery it is in the argentines have broken through
YOU1000000110_S0000021	messi kept going it is lionel messi he scores
YOU1000000110_S0000023	in a win for argentina where they look solid and set up the tournament really for the expectation that they could go a long way
YOU1000000110_S0000025	however the next game against minnow is iran was not quite so straightforward
YOU1000000110_S0000026	argentina the top team in south american qualifying against iran
YOU1000000110_S0000027	it was a tough game for argentina because iran defended really well argentina did not have that many chances during the game
YOU1000000110_S0000028	this is not argentina is day so far
YOU1000000110_S0000029	a win would send argentina through to the next round and with seconds left no one knew that better than their captain
YOU1000000110_S0000030	he will go for goal 0 my goodness gracious me if one man could win a football match it would be lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000031	messi produced maybe his most spectacular individual moment at a world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000032	classic message we have seen him do it time and time again
YOU1000000110_S0000033	messi an unbelievably talented player leading his country to victory
YOU1000000110_S0000034	the prophecy that had been made about a wonder kid many years ago was now being fulfilled
YOU1000000110_S0000036	it was really at youth world championships with argentina when he burst into public consciousness
YOU1000000110_S0000037	he was the absolute star of that tournament he actually did not start the tournament in the team
YOU1000000110_S0000038	it was very evident the kind of player he was the way that he was at times head and shoulders above everyone else on pitch
YOU1000000110_S0000039	i know so messi again 0 that was brilliantly done and what a fantastic goal that was by lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000040	in the semi final against brazil he scored from outside the box early on a thunderous shot into the top corner
YOU1000000110_S0000041	what an extraordinary start by one of the players of the tournament lionel messi
YOU1000000110_S0000042	and that took them into the final and again messi was the hero in the final he scored both goals in a 2 one win over nigeria and they were champions
YOU1000000110_S0000043	that is his penalty he scores
YOU1000000110_S0000044	being the star player he was the main player of the tournament he was the leading scorer
YOU1000000110_S0000046	argentina is trophy it is a 5th world crown
YOU1000000110_S0000047	that tournament that few weeks in the netherlands when the world knew we have got a special player in our house
YOU1000000110_S0000048	i think within argentina it was quite a clamor for him to be in the squad for 2006 there was a lot of interest when he came off the bench against serbia in the group game
YOU1000000110_S0000049	and lionel messi becomes the youngest argentine player to play at a world cup since 1934
YOU1000000110_S0000052	it is messi he just had to score
YOU1000000110_S0000053	i felt like that was going to be the perfect start to the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000055	the hero of argentina the player they have clamored for to be included as scorer 6
YOU1000000110_S0000056	it does not have a happy ending in 2006 and it could have done because they play germany in the quarterfinals the game goes to penalties and leo messi is left on the bench
YOU1000000110_S0000059	again because of circumstances beyond his control he was left watching from the sidelines in the decisive moment and his team seized him
YOU1000000110_S0000062	leo messi is career could have been very very different had he played against germany
YOU1000000110_S0000064	though already qualified topping the group would mean an easier route to the final and a better chance at lifting the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000065	it was nigeria they needed to beat and with his sights set on lifting that coveted trophy so began the messy show
YOU1000000110_S0000066	the 3rd group game was on the back of messi he scored the opening goal very early on
YOU1000000110_S0000067	the 1st one absolutely hammers it into the wall and there is no stopping it
YOU1000000110_S0000068	who was going to get there 1st messi was
YOU1000000110_S0000069	nigeria were not an easy team to play against had a lot of attacking talent his 2nd goal against nigeria is a stunning free kick
YOU1000000110_S0000070	extraordinary just everything you want from a free kick
YOU1000000110_S0000071	argentina came away with the 3 2 win on the back of 2 messy goals
YOU1000000110_S0000072	so here he was heading into the knockout stages having argentina one 3 out of 3 looking like a team that could go all the way
YOU1000000110_S0000074	against switzerland la albi celeste once again struggled to find a way through against a tough opponent
YOU1000000110_S0000075	game 7 of the round of 16
YOU1000000110_S0000076	opposition standably intent on trying to stop messi he was a man in form and a man intent on taking argentina all the way switzerland tough opponents not much in the game
YOU1000000110_S0000077	looked like it was going to go to penalties
YOU1000000110_S0000078	this time messi would leave it right up until the 118th minute before making the difference
YOU1000000110_S0000080	argentina and how argentina have punished them
YOU1000000110_S0000081	just before the dreaded penalty shootout argentina had found their way into the last 8
YOU1000000110_S0000082	and argentina now surely are safely through to the quarter finals
YOU1000000110_S0000083	against belgium it would be quite the opposite with messi capitalizing on a mistake in the 1st few minutes
YOU1000000110_S0000084	they started off superbly in way with the goal
YOU1000000110_S0000085	argentina were able to show that they had this collective structure which they have been lacking in the past that it was not just a one man team and that if they got ahead .
YOU1000000110_S0000086	they could defend for the rest of the game and close out a game to win it one 0 which is exactly what they did
YOU1000000110_S0000087	he is into the area to higuain goal argentina score in the 8th minute of the game and it is gonzalo higuain
YOU1000000110_S0000088	messi is men held firm to win the match he had now done what no argentinian captain had managed in the past 24 years
YOU1000000110_S0000089	had led his country to the semi finals messi was finally in the last 4
YOU1000000110_S0000090	although it had not been easy there had been much pain along the way
YOU1000000110_S0000092	by the time the next world cup rolled around in 2010 in south africa he was the best player in the world
YOU1000000110_S0000093	it was an incredible story would maradona be able to lead messi to the title when you look back at the highlights from nearly every game messi is involved in almost everything but he does not score
YOU1000000110_S0000095	and ultimately was unable to make much of a difference against germany
YOU1000000110_S0000097	the team system was completely different it never looked convincing
YOU1000000110_S0000098	again germany just as it had been in 2006 with the team that put them to the sword but this time in a far more convincing way
YOU1000000110_S0000099	from the opening whistle you could see that there was no way that anything was going to happen other than the germany victory
YOU1000000110_S0000100	and they are queuing up again here it is going to be put on the plate
YOU1000000110_S0000101	i think he ends up taking a lot of the blame for argentina is disastrous performance
YOU1000000110_S0000102	deeply frustrating for messi because he came away from that tournament knowing that he had not played particularly well but also knowing that he did not really have the chance to because the way the team was structured just did not allow it
YOU1000000110_S0000103	what will be regarded as a day of disaster for argentina argentina nil germany 4
YOU1000000110_S0000106	argentina the last south american standing in brazil which of these will meet it at the maracana
YOU1000000110_S0000107	the semi final neither argentina nor the netherlands have managed to score after 120 minutes
YOU1000000110_S0000108	the team that makes the world cup final will now be decided on penalties
YOU1000000110_S0000110	who fancies it who fancies it boys it is the dutch 1st
YOU1000000110_S0000112	and it is big ron vlaar what a moment in his life all force all will vlaar for the netherlands
YOU1000000110_S0000113	saved by romero
YOU1000000110_S0000114	the netherlands was again a very tough tight game
YOU1000000110_S0000115	this is when keepers come alive
YOU1000000110_S0000117	and who have argentina sent up 1st of course lionel messi the man for all moments
YOU1000000110_S0000119	for many on planet football the number one the man
YOU1000000110_S0000121	messi for sure
YOU1000000110_S0000122	the captain leads by example scoring his penalty
YOU1000000110_S0000123	there is no occasion too big
YOU1000000110_S0000124	absorbing messi is confidence argentina then proceed to score their next 2 spot kicks
YOU1000000110_S0000126	wesley steiner 0 what a save what a save
YOU1000000110_S0000127	it all comes down to maxi rodriguez a player from messi is hometown
YOU1000000110_S0000128	with this highly charged moment it is in and argentina .
YOU1000000110_S0000129	a real bounce
YOU1000000110_S0000132	argentina are set on capturing the big one on brazilian soil
YOU1000000110_S0000133	now only one team stood between argentina and the trophy and it was a familiar foe
YOU1000000110_S0000134	you do not need more motivation when you are in a world cup final we are not going to let them beat us again
YOU1000000110_S0000135	you had the feeling that this is their year this is misses opportunity
YOU1000000110_S0000136	messi is argentina would face germany once again
YOU1000000110_S0000139	germany and argentina perhaps planet football is greatest intercontinental rivalry
YOU1000000110_S0000141	there are 3 key moments i remember really in that final from messi is point of view one was when a mistake by germany sent gonzalo higuain clean through on goal
YOU1000000110_S0000142	that moment was so crucial to his career yet ironically he was not directly involved in it
YOU1000000110_S0000143	the 1st half saw chances on both sides
YOU1000000110_S0000144	little messy
YOU1000000110_S0000145	and early in the 2nd messi had his chance
YOU1000000110_S0000146	received a through ball in one of his favorite positions
YOU1000000110_S0000148	he did not miss it by much but he did miss it and that will be a moment that will haunt messi for the rest of his life
YOU1000000110_S0000150	115 minutes gone and these sides still could not be separated it was a stalemate until .
YOU1000000110_S0000153	germany by this stage had got the goal to go ahead
YOU1000000110_S0000154	taken with touch with finesse
YOU1000000110_S0000155	the game was not over
YOU1000000110_S0000156	the final moment really of the match the final significant moment bastian schweinsteiger fouled messi
YOU1000000110_S0000157	it was a long way out he was here in the world cup final with a chance to save his team
YOU1000000110_S0000158	this is messietown this is the moment
YOU1000000110_S0000160	lionel messi no it has gone away it has gone away
YOU1000000110_S0000162	the moment was too much for him
YOU1000000110_S0000163	and germany go on and win the game and messi is on the losing side
YOU1000000110_S0000164	i think that messi free kick in 2014 is a moment where a lot of argentina fans will feel that could have been their chance
YOU1000000110_S0000165	argentina is world cup dream his dream his dream of his lifetime was over
YOU1000000110_S0000166	now germany are the champions of the world
YOU1000000110_S0000167	it was so devastating when they lost in that final because it was an opportunity for us to watch the greatest player of a generation go on and win the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000169	it really started to change many of people is ideas in argentina about messi for the national team
YOU1000000110_S0000170	this is your year is not it
YOU1000000110_S0000174	in 2018 there was so much expectation on messi can he take them to the final and win it this time
YOU1000000110_S0000175	2018 for me was the realization that messi can not do it alone messi needs more quality around him
YOU1000000110_S0000177	there was one outstanding moment for messi in the tournament his goal against nigel he made a run off the shoulders of the defender
YOU1000000110_S0000178	flighted and floated and taken into his stride by lionel messi to make it one 0
YOU1000000110_S0000179	control the ball on his thigh then take a touch of his left foot then finish with his right without breaking stride
YOU1000000110_S0000181	it is mesmerizing but in the end it was not enough because argentina just were not good enough they never looked like being good enough
YOU1000000110_S0000182	right at the end of the game against france they fought back messi flicked over the ball for aguero to head home
YOU1000000110_S0000183	and argentina have another one hang on a minute sergio aguero
YOU1000000110_S0000184	and they had a last attack and that was the final charge
YOU1000000110_S0000185	argentina very very nearly but the whistle has gone
YOU1000000110_S0000186	at the end of the day in 2018 we just saw leo messi and he is cutting a despondent figure and i think it was a moment when you realize that he can not do it alone
YOU1000000110_S0000187	messi is out of the world cup and argentina are out france have won it
YOU1000000110_S0000188	he is won everything la liga copa del rey champions league world club cup but he is not won the world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000189	he wants to win the world cup because he is a winner because he is a champion because he is won everything else but not to prove anything
YOU1000000110_S0000190	and he knows that that will define his legacy there is going to be another shot you would imagine in 2022 but if it was to end today .
YOU1000000110_S0000191	you would look back and say it is disappointing because he is arguably the best player of all time
YOU1000000110_S0000192	and the one thing you want in the trophy cabinet of the best player of all time is a world cup
YOU1000000110_S0000193	he will have one last chance
YOU1000000110_S0000194	and can they do that with missy age 35
YOU1000000110_S0000195	would be just an incredible story after so many misses in different fashions if it is the last thing he does in football he will want to win the world cup
YOU1000000111_S0000001	game 7 is tied with 3 and a half to go here in the 4th
YOU1000000111_S0000003	green back to thompson
YOU1000000111_S0000005	thompson spins shoots over irving can not get up the fall and kevin love his 13th rebound
YOU1000000111_S0000007	again i think cleveland would be better served to get into whatever they are getting into quicker
YOU1000000111_S0000009	now we are going to see j r smith probably set the screen getting curry in the action
YOU1000000111_S0000011	curry now picks him up 5 to shoot james powers drives down the lane layup missed it higadala contested
YOU1000000111_S0000013	draymond green kicks it out eggedale for 3
YOU1000000111_S0000015	rebound james and he is fouled by curry
YOU1000000111_S0000017	that is going to be 4 fouls on curry 3rd team foul
YOU1000000111_S0000019	and we will take a time out as we get under the 3 minute mark
YOU1000000111_S0000021	but you want to win this has got to be the mindset this is good defense and good offense that is both ways championship effort and on the other end
YOU1000000111_S0000023	clearly the contact by curry fawcett james to go down we have ourselves a ball game a champion soon to come
YOU1000000111_S0000024	250 remaining 4th quarter of game 7
YOU1000000111_S0000025	the only triple doubles in the history of a game 7 of the finals were from jerry west and james worthy until tonight as lebron james with 2610 and 11
YOU1000000111_S0000027	green the sign of power move to the basket but iguodala right there that is clearly contact iguodala got away with it
YOU1000000111_S0000029	and those are the tough calls to make
YOU1000000111_S0000031	meanwhile draymond green one assist shy of a triple double to join james irving will bring it up
YOU1000000111_S0000033	james holding throws it into love guarded by barnes love a little jump hook short rebound green 14 rebounds for draymond green to go with 32 points

YOU1000000111_S0000037	and cavs get it back with 2.11 remaining
YOU1000000111_S0000038	that is great rotation by the cleveland cavaliers james closes to the opposite corner love pulls the trigger onto green
YOU1000000111_S0000040	terrific defense and very good offense by the warriors
YOU1000000111_S0000041	good offense on the calves part the last possession with love taking a tough shot but if i am kyrie irving on lebron james the offense is running through me right now
YOU1000000111_S0000043	irving drives hop step inside floats it up misses rebound taken by iguodala
YOU1000000111_S0000044	iguodala to curry back to iguodala up for the layup 0 blocked by james lebron james with the rejection

YOU1000000111_S0000073	and mike tyloo elects to take out tristan thompson insert richard jefferson offensively that will give him more space but if it is not a timeout defensively
YOU1000000111_S0000074	that is a real challenge for the cavaliers against the likes of curry and thompson
YOU1000000111_S0000075	each team has a foul to give as we come up on a minute remaining and they are putting curry in the pick and roll trying to get him on irving

YOU1000000114_S0000010	the notorious conor mcgregor
YOU1000000115_S0000000	how the economic machine works in 30 minutes
YOU1000000115_S0000002	the economy works like a simple machine but many people do not understand it or they do not agree on how it works
YOU1000000115_S0000003	and this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering
YOU1000000115_S0000005	i feel a deep sense of responsibility to share my simple but practical economic template
YOU1000000115_S0000007	though it is unconventional
YOU1000000115_S0000009	it has helped me to anticipate and to sidestep the global financial crisis and it has worked well for me for over 30 years
YOU1000000115_S0000010	let us begin though the economy might seem complex it works in a simple mechanical way
YOU1000000115_S0000011	it is made up of a few simple parts and a lot of simple transactions that are repeated over and over again a zillion times
YOU1000000115_S0000012	these transactions are above all else driven by human nature and they create 3 main forces that drive the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000013	number one productivity growth number 2 the short term debt cycle and number 3 the long term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000014	we will look at these 3 forces and how laying them on top of each other creates a good template for tracking economic movements and figuring out what is happening now
YOU1000000115_S0000015	let us start with the simplest part of the economy transactions
YOU1000000115_S0000017	an economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing
YOU1000000115_S0000018	you make transactions all the time every time you buy something you create a transaction
YOU1000000115_S0000019	each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods services or financial assets
YOU1000000115_S0000020	credit spends just like money so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent you can know the total spending
YOU1000000115_S0000021	the total amount of spending drives the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000022	if you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold you get the price and that is it that is a transaction
YOU1000000115_S0000023	it is the building block of the economic machine
YOU1000000115_S0000024	all cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions so if we can understand transactions we can understand the whole economy
YOU1000000115_S0000025	a market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing
YOU1000000115_S0000026	for example there is a wheat market a car market a stock market and markets for 10s of things
YOU1000000115_S0000027	an economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets
YOU1000000115_S0000028	if you add up the total spending and the total quantity sold in all of the markets you have everything you need to know to understand the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000029	it is just that simple
YOU1000000115_S0000030	people businesses banks and governments all engage in transactions the way i just described
YOU1000000115_S0000031	exchanging money and credit for goods services and financial assets
YOU1000000115_S0000032	the biggest buyer and seller is the government which consists of 2 important parts
YOU1000000115_S0000033	a central government that collects taxes and spends money and a central bank which is different from other buyers and sellers
YOU1000000115_S0000034	because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000035	it does this by influencing interest rates and printing new money
YOU1000000115_S0000037	for these reasons as we will see the central bank is an important player in the flow of credit
YOU1000000115_S0000038	i want you to pay attention to credit
YOU1000000115_S0000039	credit is the most important part of the economy and probably the least understood
YOU1000000115_S0000040	it is the most important part because it is the biggest and most volatile part
YOU1000000115_S0000042	just like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions so do lenders and borrowers
YOU1000000115_S0000043	lenders usually want to make their money into more money and borrowers usually want to buy something they can not afford
YOU1000000115_S0000044	like a house or a car or they want to invest in something like starting a business
YOU1000000115_S0000045	credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want
YOU1000000115_S0000046	borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow called principal plus an additional amount called interest
YOU1000000115_S0000047	when interest rates are high there is less borrowing because it is expensive
YOU1000000115_S0000048	when interest rates are low borrowing increases because it is cheaper
YOU1000000115_S0000050	when borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them credit is created
YOU1000000115_S0000052	any 2 people can agree to create credit out of thin air
YOU1000000115_S0000053	that seems simple enough but credit is tricky because it has different names
YOU1000000115_S0000054	as soon as credit is created it immediately turns into debt
YOU1000000115_S0000055	debt is both an asset to the lender and a liability to the borrower
YOU1000000115_S0000057	in the future when the borrower repays the loan plus interest the asset and the liability disappear and the transaction is settled
YOU1000000115_S0000058	so why is credit so important
YOU1000000115_S0000060	because when a borrower receives credit he is able to increase his spending and remember spending drives the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000061	this is because one person is spending is another person is income
YOU1000000115_S0000062	think about it
YOU1000000115_S0000064	every dollar you spend someone else earns and every dollar you earn someone else has spent
YOU1000000115_S0000065	so when you spend more someone else earns more
YOU1000000115_S0000066	when someone is income rises it makes lenders more willing to lend him money because now he is more worthy of credit
YOU1000000115_S0000067	a creditworthy borrower has 2 things the ability to repay and collateral
YOU1000000115_S0000068	having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay
YOU1000000115_S0000070	in the event that he can not repay he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold this makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money
YOU1000000115_S0000071	so increased income allows increased borrowing which allows increased spending
YOU1000000115_S0000072	and since one person is spending is another person is income this leads to more increased borrowing and so on
YOU1000000115_S0000073	this self reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have cycles
YOU1000000115_S0000075	in a transaction you have to give something in order to get something and how much you get depends on how much you produce
YOU1000000115_S0000077	over time we learn and that accumulated knowledge raises our living standards we call this productivity growth
YOU1000000115_S0000078	those who are inventive and hard working raise their productivity and their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy
YOU1000000115_S0000079	but that is not necessarily true over the short run
YOU1000000115_S0000080	productivity matters most in the long run but credit matters most in the short run
YOU1000000115_S0000081	this is because productivity growth does not fluctuate much so it is not a big driver of economic swings
YOU1000000115_S0000082	debt is because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we have to pay it back
YOU1000000115_S0000083	debt swings occur in 2 big cycles one takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years
YOU1000000115_S0000084	while most people feel the swings they typically do not see them as cycles because they see them too up close day by day week by week
YOU1000000115_S0000085	in this chapter we are going to step back and look at these 3 big forces and how they interact to make up our experiences
YOU1000000115_S0000086	as mentioned swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is they are primarily due to how much credit there is
YOU1000000115_S0000087	let us for a 2nd imagine an economy without credit in this economy the only way i can increase my spending is to increase my income
YOU1000000115_S0000088	which requires me to be more productive and do more work increased productivity is the only way for growth
YOU1000000115_S0000089	since my spending is another person is income the economy grows every time i or anyone else is more productive
YOU1000000115_S0000090	if we follow the transactions and play this out we see a progression like the productivity growth line but because we borrow we have cycles
YOU1000000115_S0000091	this is not due to any laws or regulations it is due to human nature and the way that credit works
YOU1000000115_S0000092	think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward in order to buy something you can not afford you need to spend more than you make
YOU1000000115_S0000093	to do this you essentially need to borrow from your future self in doing so you create a time in the future that you need to spend less than you make
YOU1000000115_S0000094	in order to pay it back it very quickly resembles a cycle basically any time you borrow you create a cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000095	this is as true for an individual as it is for the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000096	this is why understanding credit is so important because it sets into motion a mechanical predictable series of events that will happen in the future
YOU1000000115_S0000097	this makes credit different from money money is what you settle transactions with
YOU1000000115_S0000098	when you buy a beer from a bartender with cash the transaction is settled immediately
YOU1000000115_S0000099	but when you buy a beer with credit it is like starting a bar tab you are saying you promise to pay in the future
YOU1000000115_S0000100	together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability you just created credit out of thin air
YOU1000000115_S0000101	it is not until you pay the bar tab later that the asset and the liability disappear the debt goes away and the transaction is settled
YOU1000000115_S0000103	the reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit
YOU1000000115_S0000104	the total amount of credit in the united states is about $50 and the total amount of money is only about $30
YOU1000000115_S0000105	remember in an economy without credit the only way to increase your spending is to produce more
YOU1000000115_S0000106	but in an economy with credit you can also increase your spending by borrowing
YOU1000000115_S0000107	as a result an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run but not over the long run
YOU1000000115_S0000108	now do not get me wrong credit is not necessarily something bad that just causes cycles
YOU1000000115_S0000109	it is bad when it finances overconsumption that can not be paid back
YOU1000000115_S0000110	however it is good when it efficiently allocates resources and produces income so you can pay back the debt
YOU1000000115_S0000111	for example if you borrow money to buy a big tv it does not generate income for you to pay back the debt
YOU1000000115_S0000112	but if you borrow money to say buy a tractor .
YOU1000000115_S0000114	and that tractor lets you harvest more crops and earn more money then you can pay back your debt and improve your living standards
YOU1000000115_S0000116	in an economy with credit we can follow the transactions and see how credit creates growth
YOU1000000115_S0000118	let me give you an example suppose you earn $10 a year and have no debt you are credit worthy enough to borrow $10000
YOU1000000115_S0000119	say on a credit card so you can spend $110000 even though you only earn $10
YOU1000000115_S0000120	since your spending is another person is income someone is earning $110000
YOU1000000115_S0000121	the person earning $110000 with no debt can borrow $11000 so he can spend $121000
YOU1000000115_S0000122	even though he has only earned $110000
YOU1000000115_S0000123	his spending is another person is income and by following the transactions we can begin to see how this process works in a self reinforcing pattern
YOU1000000115_S0000124	but remember borrowing creates cycles and if the cycle goes up it eventually needs to come down
YOU1000000115_S0000125	this leads us into the short term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000127	as economic activity increases we see an expansion the 1st phase of the short term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000128	spending continues to increase and prices start to rise
YOU1000000115_S0000129	this happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit which can be created instantly out of thin air
YOU1000000115_S0000130	when the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods prices rise
YOU1000000115_S0000131	when prices rise we call this inflation the central bank does not want too much inflation because it causes problems
YOU1000000115_S0000132	seeing prices rise it raises interest rates with higher interest rates fewer people can afford to borrow money
YOU1000000115_S0000133	and the cost of existing debts rises think about this as the monthly payments on your credit card going up
YOU1000000115_S0000135	because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments they have less money left over to spend so spending slows
YOU1000000115_S0000136	and since one person is spending is another person is income incomes drop and so on and so forth
YOU1000000115_S0000137	when people spend less prices go down we call this deflation economic activity decreases
YOU1000000115_S0000138	and we have a recession if the recession becomes too severe and inflation is no longer a problem
YOU1000000115_S0000139	the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again
YOU1000000115_S0000140	with low interest rates debt repayments are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up and we see another expansion
YOU1000000115_S0000141	as you can see the economy works like a machine
YOU1000000115_S0000142	in the short term debt cycle spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit
YOU1000000115_S0000143	when credit is easily available there is an economic expansion when credit is not easily available there is a recession
YOU1000000115_S0000144	and note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank
YOU1000000115_S0000145	the short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 to 8 years and happens over and over again for decades
YOU1000000115_S0000146	but notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt
YOU1000000115_S0000147	why because people push it
YOU1000000115_S0000148	they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt it is human nature
YOU1000000115_S0000149	because of this over long periods of time debts rise faster than incomes creating the long term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000151	despite people becoming more indebted lenders even more freely extend credit
YOU1000000115_S0000153	why
YOU1000000115_S0000155	because everyone thinks things are going great people are just focused on what has been happening lately and what has been happening lately
YOU1000000115_S0000157	incomes have been rising asset values are going up the stock market roars it is a boom
YOU1000000115_S0000158	it pays to buy goods services and financial assets with borrowed money when people do a lot of that we call it a bubble
YOU1000000115_S0000159	so even though debts have been growing incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them let us call the ratio of debt to income the debt burden
YOU1000000115_S0000160	so long as incomes continue to rise the debt burden stays manageable at the same time asset values soar
YOU1000000115_S0000161	people borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher
YOU1000000115_S0000162	people feel wealthy
YOU1000000115_S0000164	so even with the accumulation of lots of debt rising incomes and asset values help borrowers remain creditworthy for a long time
YOU1000000115_S0000165	but this obviously cannot continue forever and it does not
YOU1000000115_S0000166	over decades debt burdens slowly increased creating larger and larger debt repayments
YOU1000000115_S0000167	at some point debt repayments start growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending
YOU1000000115_S0000168	and since one person is spending is another person is income incomes begin to go down which makes people less creditworthy
YOU1000000115_S0000170	causing borrowing to go down debt repayments continue to rise which makes spending drop even further
YOU1000000115_S0000171	and the cycle reverses itself
YOU1000000115_S0000173	this is the long term debt peak debt burdens have simply become too big
YOU1000000115_S0000175	for the united states europe and much of the rest of the world this happened in 2008
YOU1000000115_S0000176	it happened for the same reason it happened in japan in 1989 and in the united states back in 1929
YOU1000000115_S0000177	now the economy begins deleveraging
YOU1000000115_S0000179	in a deleveraging people cut spending incomes fall credit disappears asset prices drop
YOU1000000115_S0000180	banks get squeezed the stock market crashes social tensions rise and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way
YOU1000000115_S0000182	as incomes fall and debt repayments rise borrowers get squeezed no longer credit worthy
YOU1000000115_S0000183	credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt repayments
YOU1000000115_S0000184	scrambling to fill this hole borrowers are forced to sell assets the rush to sell assets floods the market at the same time as spending falls
YOU1000000115_S0000185	this is when the stock market collapses the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble
YOU1000000115_S0000186	as asset prices drop the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops this makes borrowers even less credit worthy
YOU1000000115_S0000187	people feel poor credit rapidly disappears
YOU1000000115_S0000188	less spending less income less wealth less credit less borrowing and so on it is a vicious cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000189	this appears similar to a recession but the difference here is that interest rates can not be lowered to save the day
YOU1000000115_S0000190	in a recession lowering interest rates works to stimulate borrowing
YOU1000000115_S0000191	however in a deleveraging lowering interest rates does not work because interest rates are already low and soon hit 0% so the stimulation ends
YOU1000000115_S0000193	interest rates in the united states hit 0% during the deleveraging of the 1930s and again in 2008
YOU1000000115_S0000194	the difference between a recession and a deleveraging
YOU1000000115_S0000195	is that in a deleveraging borrower is debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can not be relieved by lowering interest rates
YOU1000000115_S0000196	lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back
YOU1000000115_S0000197	borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value
YOU1000000115_S0000198	they feel crippled by the debt they do not even want more lenders stop lending borrowers stop borrowing
YOU1000000115_S0000199	think of the economy as being not creditworthy just like an individual so what do you do about a deleveraging
YOU1000000115_S0000200	the problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down
YOU1000000115_S0000201	there are 4 ways this can happen one people businesses and governments cut their spending
YOU1000000115_S0000202	2 debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings 3 wealth is redistributed from the haves to the have nots
YOU1000000115_S0000203	and finally 4 the central bank prints new money these 4 ways have happened in every deleveraging in modern history
YOU1000000115_S0000205	usually spending is cut 1st as we just saw people businesses and even governments tighten their belts and cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt
YOU1000000115_S0000206	this is often referred to as austerity when borrowers stop taking on new debts and start paying down old debts
YOU1000000115_S0000207	you might expect the death burden to decrease but the opposite happens because spending is cut
YOU1000000115_S0000208	and one man is spending is another man is income it causes incomes to fall
YOU1000000115_S0000209	they fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse as we have seen this cut in spending is deflationary and painful
YOU1000000115_S0000210	businesses are forced to cut costs which means less jobs and higher unemployment this leads to the next step debts must be reduced
YOU1000000115_S0000211	many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans and a borrower is debts are a lender is assets
YOU1000000115_S0000212	when a borrower does not repay the bank people get nervous that the bank will not be able to repay them so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank
YOU1000000115_S0000213	banks get squeezed and people businesses and banks default on their debts
YOU1000000115_S0000214	this severe economic contraction is a depression
YOU1000000115_S0000215	a big part of a depression is people discovering much of what they thought was their wealth is not really there
YOU1000000115_S0000216	let us go back to the bar when you bought a beer and put it on a bar tab you promised to repay the bartender
YOU1000000115_S0000217	your promise became an asset of the bartender
YOU1000000115_S0000218	but if you break your promise if you do not pay him back and essentially default on your bar tab then the asset he has is not really worth anything
YOU1000000115_S0000219	it has basically disappeared
YOU1000000115_S0000221	many lenders do not want their assets to disappear and agree to debt restructuring
YOU1000000115_S0000222	debt restructuring means lenders get paid back less or get paid back over a longer time frame or at a lower interest rate than was 1st agreed
YOU1000000115_S0000223	somehow a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt lenders would rather have a little of something than all of nothing
YOU1000000115_S0000224	even though debt disappears debt restructuring causes income and asset values to disappear faster so the debt burden continues to get worse
YOU1000000115_S0000225	like cutting spending debt reduction is also painful and deflationary
YOU1000000115_S0000227	all of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment means the government collects fewer taxes
YOU1000000115_S0000228	at the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen
YOU1000000115_S0000229	many of the unemployed have inadequate savings and need financial support from the government
YOU1000000115_S0000230	additionally governments create stimulus plans and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy
YOU1000000115_S0000231	government is budget deficits explode in a deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes
YOU1000000115_S0000232	this is what is happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news
YOU1000000115_S0000234	to fund their deficits governments need to either raise taxes or borrow money
YOU1000000115_S0000235	but with incomes falling and so many unemployed who is the money going to come from
YOU1000000115_S0000236	the rich since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people
YOU1000000115_S0000237	governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy from the haves to the have nots
YOU1000000115_S0000238	the have nots who are suffering begin to resent the wealthy haves
YOU1000000115_S0000239	the wealthy haves being squeezed by the weak economy falling asset prices and higher taxes begin to resent the have nots
YOU1000000115_S0000240	if the depression continues social disorder can break out
YOU1000000115_S0000241	not only do tensions rise within countries they can rise between countries especially debtor and creditor countries
YOU1000000115_S0000242	this situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme
YOU1000000115_S0000243	in the 1930s this led to hitler coming to power war in europe and depression in the united states
YOU1000000115_S0000244	pressure to do something to end the depression increases
YOU1000000115_S0000245	remember most of what people thought was money was actually credit so when credit disappears people do not have enough money
YOU1000000115_S0000246	people are desperate for money and you remember who can print money the central bank can
YOU1000000115_S0000248	having already lowered its interest rates to nearly 0 it is forced to print money
YOU1000000115_S0000249	unlike cutting spending debt reduction and wealth redistribution printing money is inflationary and stimulative
YOU1000000115_S0000250	inevitably the central bank prints new money out of thin air and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds
YOU1000000115_S0000251	it happened in the united states during the great depression
YOU1000000115_S0000252	and again in 2008 when the united states central bank the federal reserve printed over $20
YOU1000000115_S0000253	other central banks around the world that could printed a lot of money too
YOU1000000115_S0000254	by buying financial assets with this money it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more creditworthy
YOU1000000115_S0000255	however this only helps those who own financial assets you see the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets
YOU1000000115_S0000256	the central government on the other hand can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people but it can not print money
YOU1000000115_S0000257	so in order to stimulate the economy the 2 must cooperate
YOU1000000115_S0000258	by buying government bonds the central bank essentially lends money to the government allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending
YOU1000000115_S0000259	on goods and services through its stimulus programs and unemployment benefits
YOU1000000115_S0000260	this increases people is income as well as the government is debt however it will lower the economy is total debt burden
YOU1000000115_S0000261	this is a very risky time policymakers need to balance the 4 ways that debt burdens come down
YOU1000000115_S0000263	the deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in order to maintain stability
YOU1000000115_S0000264	if balanced correctly there can be a beautiful deleverage
YOU1000000115_S0000266	you see a deleveraging can be ugly or it can be beautiful how can a deleveraging be beautiful
YOU1000000115_S0000268	even though a deleveraging is a difficult situation handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful
YOU1000000115_S0000269	a lot more beautiful than the debt fueled unbalanced excesses of the leveraging phase
YOU1000000115_S0000270	in a beautiful deleveraging debts decline relative to income real economic growth is +and inflation is not a problem
YOU1000000115_S0000271	it is achieved by having the right balance the right balance requires a certain mix of cutting spending reducing debt
YOU1000000115_S0000273	transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained
YOU1000000115_S0000274	people ask if printing money will raise inflation it will not if it offsets falling credit
YOU1000000115_S0000275	remember spending is what matters a dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on price as a dollar of spending paid for with credit
YOU1000000115_S0000277	by printing money the central bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money
YOU1000000115_S0000278	in order to turn things around the central bank needs to not only pump up income growth
YOU1000000115_S0000279	but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the accumulated debt
YOU1000000115_S0000280	so what do i mean by that basically income needs to grow faster than debt grows
YOU1000000115_S0000281	for example let us assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt to income ratio of 100%
YOU1000000115_S0000282	that means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year
YOU1000000115_S0000283	now think about the interest rate on that debt let us say it is 2%
YOU1000000115_S0000284	if debt is growing at 2% because of that interest rate and income is only growing at around one you will never reduce the debt burden
YOU1000000115_S0000285	you need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the rate of interest
YOU1000000115_S0000286	however printing money could easily be abused because it is so easy to do and people prefer it to the alternatives
YOU1000000115_S0000287	the key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptably high inflation the way germany did during its deleveraging in the 1920s
YOU1000000115_S0000288	if policy makers achieve the right balance a deleveraging is not so dramatic growth is slow but debt burdens go down
YOU1000000115_S0000289	that is a beautiful deleveraging when incomes begin to rise borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy
YOU1000000115_S0000290	and when borrowers appear more creditworthy lenders begin to lend money again debt burdens finally begin to fall
YOU1000000115_S0000291	able to borrow money people can spend more eventually the economy begins to grow again leading to the reflation phase of the long term debt cycle
YOU1000000115_S0000292	though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly if handled well it will eventually fix the problem
YOU1000000115_S0000293	it takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal hence the term lost decade
YOU1000000115_S0000294	in closing of course the economy is a little bit more complicated than this template suggests
YOU1000000115_S0000295	however laying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycle and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line
YOU1000000115_S0000296	gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we have been where we are now and where we are probably headed
YOU1000000115_S0000297	so in summary there are 3 rules of thumb that i would like you to take away from this
YOU1000000115_S0000298	1st do not have debt rise faster than income because your debt burdens will eventually crush you
YOU1000000115_S0000299	2nd do not have income rise faster than productivity because you will eventually become uncompetitive
YOU1000000115_S0000300	and 3rd do all that you can to raise your productivity because in the long run that is what matters most
YOU1000000115_S0000301	this is simple advice for you and it is simple advice for policymakers
YOU1000000115_S0000302	you might be surprised but most people including most policy makers do not pay enough attention to this
YOU1000000115_S0000303	this template has worked for me and i hope it will work for you thank you
YOU1000000116_S0000000	as we begin our journey into the world of economics i thought i would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all times
YOU1000000116_S0000001	the scottish philosopher adam smith and he really is kind of the 1st real economist in the way that we view it now and this is from his
YOU1000000116_S0000002	the wealth of nations published in 1776 coincidentally the same year as the american declaration of independence
YOU1000000116_S0000003	and it is one of the most famous excerpts he generally indeed he being an economic actor neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it
YOU1000000116_S0000004	by directing that industry so the industry in control of that individual actor in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain
YOU1000000116_S0000005	he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote and end
YOU1000000116_S0000006	which was no part of his intention and this term invisible hand is famous led by an invisible hand to promote an end
YOU1000000116_S0000007	which was no part of his intention he is saying look when individual actors just act in their own self interest that often an aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend
YOU1000000116_S0000008	and then he says nor is it always the worst for society that it was no part of it so it is not always necessarily a bad thing by pursuing his own interest
YOU1000000116_S0000009	he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it so this is a pretty strong statement
YOU1000000116_S0000010	it is really at the core of capitalism and that is why i point out that it was published the same year as the american declaration of independence because obviously
YOU1000000116_S0000011	america the founding fathers they wrote the declaration of independence the constitution it really talks about what it means to be a democratic country what are the rights of its citizens
YOU1000000116_S0000012	but the united states in its overall experience of an american is at least as influenced by the work of adam smith
YOU1000000116_S0000013	by these kind of foundational ideas of capitalism and they just both happened to happen around the same time
YOU1000000116_S0000014	but this idea is not always that intuitive individual actors by essentially pursuing their own self interested ends might be doing more for society
YOU1000000116_S0000015	than if any of them actually try to promote the overall well being of society and i do not think adam smith would say that it is always good
YOU1000000116_S0000016	for someone to act self interested or that it is never good for people to actually think about the implications of what they are doing in an aggregate sense but he is saying that frequently
YOU1000000116_S0000017	frequently this self interested action could lead to the greater good could lead to more innovation could lead to better investment
YOU1000000116_S0000018	could lead to more productivity could lead to more wealth a larger pie for everyone
YOU1000000116_S0000019	and now economics is frequently and when he makes a statement he is actually making a mix of a microeconomic and a macroeconomic statement
YOU1000000116_S0000020	micro is that people individual actors are acting in their own self interest and the macro is that it might be good for the economy or for the nation as a whole
YOU1000000116_S0000021	and so now modern economists tend to divide themselves into these 2 schools or into these 2 subjects
YOU1000000116_S0000023	microeconomics which is the study of individual actors and those actors could be firms it could be people it could be households
YOU1000000116_S0000024	and you have macroeconomics which is the study of the economy in aggregate macro
YOU1000000116_S0000026	economics and you get it from their words
YOU1000000116_S0000027	so micro the prefix refers to very small things macro refers to the larger the bigger picture and so microeconomics just to restate it is essentially
YOU1000000116_S0000028	how actors make decisions or i guess we could say allocations decisions slash
YOU1000000116_S0000029	allocations of scarce resources and you are going to hear the word scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics
YOU1000000116_S0000030	and a scarce resource is one that you do not have an infinite amount of for example love might not be a scarce resource you might have an infinite amount of love
YOU1000000116_S0000031	but a resource that would be scarce is something like food or water or money or time or labor these are all scarce resources
YOU1000000116_S0000032	and so microeconomics is well how do people decide where to put those scarce resources how do they decide where to deploy them and how does that affect prices and markets and whatever else
YOU1000000116_S0000033	macroeconomics is a study of what happens in aggregate to an economy
YOU1000000116_S0000034	to an economy from the 10s of individual actors aggregate economy we now have 10s
YOU1000000116_S0000035	10s of actors and it often focuses on policy related questions so do you raise or lower taxes or what is going to happen when you raise or lower taxes
YOU1000000116_S0000036	do you regulate or deregulate how does that affect the overall productivity when you do these so it is policy
YOU1000000116_S0000037	top down questions and in both macro and microeconomics especially in the modern sense of it
YOU1000000116_S0000039	there is an attempt to make them rigorous to make them mathematical so in either case you can start with some of the ideas some of the philosophical ideas or the logical ideas
YOU1000000116_S0000040	that say someone like an adam smith might have so you have these and there are basic ideas about how people think how people make decisions
YOU1000000116_S0000041	so philosophy of people of decision making in the case of microeconomics decision making
YOU1000000116_S0000042	and then you make some assumptions about it or you simplify it so i will do it like this you simplify it
YOU1000000116_S0000043	and you really are simplifying you say 0 all people are rational or all people are going to act in their own self interest or all people are going to maximize their gain which is not true
YOU1000000116_S0000044	human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things but you simplify these things so that you can start to deal with it in kind of a mathematical way
YOU1000000116_S0000045	so you simplify it so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense and this is valuable it can clarify your thinking it can allow you to prove things
YOU1000000116_S0000046	based on your assumptions and so you can start to visualize things mathematically with charts and graphs and think about what will actually happen with the markets
YOU1000000116_S0000047	so it is very very valuable to have this mathematical rigorous thinking but at the same time it can be a little bit dangerous because you are making this huge simplification
YOU1000000116_S0000048	and sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions which you might feel very strongly about because it looks like you have proven them
YOU1000000116_S0000049	the same way that you might prove relativity but they were based on some assumptions that either might be wrong or might be oversimplifications or might not be relevant
YOU1000000116_S0000050	to the context that you are trying to make conclusions about so it is very very very important to take it all with a grain of salt to remember that it is all based on some simplifying assumptions
YOU1000000116_S0000051	and macroeconomics is probably even more guilty of it in microeconomics you are taking these deeply complicated things the human brain how people act and respond to each other
YOU1000000116_S0000052	and then you are aggregating it over 10s of people so it is ultra complicated you have 10s of these infinitely complicated people all interacting with each other
YOU1000000116_S0000053	it is very complicated 10s of interactions and fundamentally unpredictable interactions and then trying to make assumptions on those
YOU1000000116_S0000054	trying to make assumptions and then doing math with that that could lead you to some conclusions or might lead you to some predictions
YOU1000000116_S0000055	and once again it is very important this is valuable it is valuable to make these mathematical models to make these mathematical assumptions these mathematical conclusions
YOU1000000116_S0000056	but it always needs to be taken with a grain of salt and so that you have a proper grain of salt and so that you are always focused on the true intuition
YOU1000000116_S0000057	and that is really the most important thing to get from a course of economics so that you can truly reason through what is likely to happen maybe even without the mathematics
YOU1000000116_S0000058	i will leave you with 2 quotes and these quotes are a little bit funny but they really i think are helpful things to keep in mind as you start to especially go deep into the mathematical side
YOU1000000116_S0000059	of economics so this right over here is a quote by alfred knopf who was a publisher in the 1900s
YOU1000000116_S0000060	an economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible and i am assuming when he is talking about the incomprehensible he is referring to some of the mathy stuff that you see
YOU1000000116_S0000061	in economics and hopefully we will make this as comprehensible as possible and see that there is value in this but it is a very important statement he is making
YOU1000000116_S0000062	oftentimes it is stating a common sense thing it is stating something that is obvious and it is very important to always keep that in mind
YOU1000000116_S0000063	to always make sure that you have the intuition for what is happening in the math or to know when the math is going in a direction that might be strange based on oversimplifications
YOU1000000116_S0000064	or wrong assumptions and then you have this quote over here by lawrence j peter most famous for peter is principles a professor at usc
YOU1000000116_S0000065	an economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday did not happen today and once again important to keep in the back of one is mind
YOU1000000116_S0000066	because especially and this is especially relevant to macroeconomics because in macroeconomics there is all sorts of predictions about the state of the economy
YOU1000000116_S0000067	what needs to be done how long will the recession last what will be the economic growth next year what will inflation do and they often prove to be wrong
YOU1000000116_S0000068	in fact few economists even tend to agree on many of these things and it is very important to realize that because oftentimes when you are deep in the mathematics of the economics it might seem
YOU1000000116_S0000069	to be a science like physics but it is not a science like physics it is open to subjectivity
YOU1000000116_S0000070	and a lot of that subjectivity is all around the assumptions that you choose to make
YOU1000000117_S0000000	all right i think we are at time so let us get started welcome to folks i do not know i am doctor lori santos a professor here at yale university
YOU1000000117_S0000001	and the teacher of the science of wellbeing course on coursera org and a host of the happiness lab podcast
YOU1000000117_S0000002	we wanted to do this facebook live event today because i know all of you are struggling with covid 19
YOU1000000117_S0000003	and all the anxieties and the uncertainties that come with it we know of course all the physical things we need to do to protect our physical health right we should be washing our hands and socially distancing and so on
YOU1000000117_S0000004	but i think a lot of us are struggling right now with the kinds of things we should be doing to protect our mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000005	and we need to be just as intentional about protecting our own anxieties and depressions and sort of fixing that as we are protecting our physical health
YOU1000000117_S0000006	and this call today is to answer all your questions about the types of things that science suggests that we can do to promote our mental health in this challenging time
YOU1000000117_S0000007	what i am going to be doing is answering all of your questions so please be sending them in on the side
YOU1000000117_S0000008	if you have not yet send us an emoji to let us know you are there please let us know
YOU1000000117_S0000009	and i think since we have such a short time i think we are just going to jump right into it
YOU1000000117_S0000010	you will see me kind of looking over at the side on my chat screen to see what the questions are
YOU1000000117_S0000011	and the 1st question we have today is from elizabeth who asks do you have any advice on dealing with or reducing tension and arguing in your relationship during these stay at home orders
YOU1000000117_S0000012	this one is a big one i think you are speaking to me i think a lot of us are facing the challenge right now
YOU1000000117_S0000013	that we are spending more time with our spouses with our partners with our kids
YOU1000000117_S0000014	and that can be incredibly challenging normally but it is especially challenging in an otherwise anxiety provoking time
YOU1000000117_S0000015	and so i think the 1st piece of advice i have is to just validate that like yeah this is a big thing that we are all struggling with
YOU1000000117_S0000016	but then to sort of encourage everyone to be a little bit patient
YOU1000000117_S0000017	the research on relationships and what allows relationships to succeed folks like professor eli finkel and others
YOU1000000117_S0000018	they really suggest that a lot of our relationships success has to do with our expectations
YOU1000000117_S0000019	and i think if anything we might want to just be a little chiller about our expectations for our spouses than we might have been before
YOU1000000117_S0000020	all of us are going through this struggling time and so if you have a spouse who say you know did not empty the dishwasher or is not doing their part as much with kids
YOU1000000117_S0000021	i think this is a time to be compassionate both with them and with yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000022	and to kind of downgrade expectations a little bit
YOU1000000117_S0000023	but the particular advice i would give is if you think about your relationship with your spouse there is always things that we really love about our spouse that in a relationship we do very very well together
YOU1000000117_S0000024	and this is the time to double down on those good things
YOU1000000117_S0000025	so if you both connect in terms of hanging out with the kids and working with the kids that is a time to double down on that
YOU1000000117_S0000026	if you both connect on humor now is the time to be watching a comedy movie together
YOU1000000117_S0000027	and so the basic advice is to kind of show them and yourself a little compassion like now is the time to kind of down regulate your expectations
YOU1000000117_S0000028	but also if there are things that are good in your relationship be very intentional about promoting those in this tough time
YOU1000000117_S0000029	and that sometimes requires a little creativity you know if you are you think you are great with with your spouse is going out to dinner and having these wonderful outdoor dates
YOU1000000117_S0000030	you might need to get creative but with a little creativity you can really patch up a relationship
YOU1000000117_S0000031	and kind of down regulate the stress that we see
YOU1000000117_S0000032	remember in natural disasters it is a time that we see things like divorce rates increasing
YOU1000000117_S0000033	but it is also the time that we see new relationships forming people making babies
YOU1000000117_S0000034	it really depends on your intentional efforts you can make this challenging time better in your relationship
YOU1000000117_S0000035	so that was elizabeth is question next question we have up is from melissa
YOU1000000117_S0000036	she asks how do we stay informed with current and updated news without increasing our anxious feelings we may have
YOU1000000117_S0000037	this is another one i am struggling with as well like you i want to be informed about what is going on in my town what has the president said recently and so on
YOU1000000117_S0000038	but i feel like every time i watch the news i can watch my anxiety skyrocket
YOU1000000117_S0000039	in terms of what anxiety feels like in the body for me that is watching my chest constrict i am watching myself breathe faster it just kind of does not feel good
YOU1000000117_S0000040	and so this is a real challenge of how to stay informed without creating more anxiety
YOU1000000117_S0000041	the way i have been able to solve it myself is to kind of do that paying attention that mindfulness about what the news is making me feel
YOU1000000117_S0000042	and there is times when it feels like information and there is times when it feels like i am already really anxious
YOU1000000117_S0000043	i do not want to add to that by adding any more news onto it
YOU1000000117_S0000044	and so i think the key is to just be really deliberate about what you are consuming
YOU1000000117_S0000045	and also to have some choice about what you are consuming you can pay attention to what is going on but try to upregulate the information about the positive news
YOU1000000117_S0000046	so for example there is a wonderful hashtag on twitter called covidkindness which you can use to check out to see all the good things that are happening out there
YOU1000000117_S0000047	and so i think trying to balance some of the doom and gloom that you are seeing with some of the positive things can be really powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000048	but honestly what i have done myself is to really decrease the amount of news that i am consuming
YOU1000000117_S0000049	particularly before i go to bed i now have a rule of like basically past 6 or 7 p m
YOU1000000117_S0000050	i put my phone away i am not on social media as much i am really trying to not be consuming the news at that time
YOU1000000117_S0000051	because i am watching it mindfully and noticing that it is affecting my sleep
YOU1000000117_S0000052	most of that information is going to be there the next morning and so find ways to protect your sleep and to protect your own anxiety levels
YOU1000000117_S0000053	and it is okay to be self compassionate if you need to avoid some of that stuff
YOU1000000117_S0000054	again the 24 hour news cycle is going to be back when you look again you are not going to miss too much
YOU1000000117_S0000056	next question comes from a bunch of folks lee and jenna and anna all asking similar questions about the mental health needs for frontline workers
YOU1000000117_S0000057	they ask basically how can frontline workers and healthcare workers generally practice self care and combat anxiety what is the best way to support these workers
YOU1000000117_S0000058	i am so glad this question came up and it is great that it came up from so many folks
YOU1000000117_S0000059	because this is something that i care about very deeply i am so grateful that there are health care workers out there really risking their health and their lives
YOU1000000117_S0000060	to protect me and my family and my community and so thank you with gratitude for the fact that you are doing that
YOU1000000117_S0000061	i think there are lots of intentional things that even folks who are on the front line can do to protect their mental health in this scary time
YOU1000000117_S0000062	one of those things comes from a refocus that you really need to protect your own mental health needs during this time
YOU1000000117_S0000063	and that means explicitly taking time to kind of pay attention to your anxiety levels and watch the things that you can do to deal with that
YOU1000000117_S0000064	i think in between patients if you can give yourself a break for say 3 conscious breaths
YOU1000000117_S0000065	3 very slow breaths where you breathe into your belly
YOU1000000117_S0000066	and just kind of have a moment to take a 2nd and be present
YOU1000000117_S0000067	those things will down regulate your sympathetic nervous system it will kick in the parasympathetic activity that we know allows for kind of a rest and digest
YOU1000000117_S0000068	and the more you can sort of take short breaks to do that all the more powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000069	i think a 2nd thing i would say for healthcare workers is to make sure that you are reframing what you are doing in as positive a way as possible
YOU1000000117_S0000070	i mean ultimately you are doing something that is incredibly brave that is helping folks but sometimes in the frantic day to day anxiousness of that you can lose that
YOU1000000117_S0000071	and there is lots of research by folks like david disteno and others that shows that taking time to realize that what you are doing is compassionately helping other people
YOU1000000117_S0000072	recognizing that it is a pro social action can actually allow you a little bit more resilience and it can actually up regulate what is called your self regulation your ability to do hard things
YOU1000000117_S0000073	and so i think kind of turning on your compassion muscles turning on this idea that you are doing something pro socially can be incredibly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000074	and the final quick tip this is more of a practice tip but for healthcare workers right now is that
YOU1000000117_S0000075	there is lots of evidence that specific kinds of meditation practices can reduce burnout even in incredibly stressful times
YOU1000000117_S0000076	and this is true for health care workers but also service providers and even folks like who work at the grocery store who really have to give up and sacrifice right now to help other people
YOU1000000117_S0000077	and this specific kind of meditation is what is known as loving kindness meditation or metta
YOU1000000117_S0000078	it is basically a meditation practice where you work on practicing compassion you actually think about different people in your life
YOU1000000117_S0000079	and extend to them information about being happy and healthy
YOU1000000117_S0000080	you actually use a mantra of may you be happy may you be healthy
YOU1000000117_S0000081	but the research suggests that the simple act of doing this even really temporarily can allow you to feel compassion this urge to help people without the empathy that goes with it
YOU1000000117_S0000082	in other words without the kind of burnout that comes from feeling those other people is emotions
YOU1000000117_S0000083	i think this can be an incredibly powerful technique for healthcare workers right now and you can start it today
YOU1000000117_S0000084	lots of free apps online from insight timer to calm to even 10% happier with dan harris there
YOU1000000117_S0000085	allowing health care workers to use these things freely available
YOU1000000117_S0000086	and they are allowing those healthcare workers to access loving kindness meditation specifically
YOU1000000117_S0000087	so jump on and do one of these meditations even for 5 minutes in the morning you know when you are taking your shower
YOU1000000117_S0000088	it is the kind of thing that can really improve your kind of resilience and protect you from burnout later on
YOU1000000117_S0000089	okay so that was about healthcare workers now we have a new question from tracy
YOU1000000117_S0000090	tracy asks how do you keep yourself positive during this time when living alone when you are away from your family and friends
YOU1000000117_S0000091	i think this one is the flip side of the question that was asked earlier about how to deal with the stress of living with your spouse
YOU1000000117_S0000092	there is a different kind of stress that comes from living alone and being away from family and friends in this really hard time
YOU1000000117_S0000093	and i think the answer to this one is that you can be physically alone without being socially alone
YOU1000000117_S0000094	in other words you can be using technology to reach out to all those friends and family members
YOU1000000117_S0000095	and i think in this scary time we need to be doing this even more than ever and even more intentionally than ever
YOU1000000117_S0000096	you know it is one thing to kind of be home alone but it is another to know that you have you know zoom yoga classes with friends of yours
YOU1000000117_S0000097	or a zoom dinner date with your parents who are far away in different time zones
YOU1000000117_S0000098	these are the kinds of things you can build into your day even if you are living alone and i think that is really critical
YOU1000000117_S0000099	one thing to know is that the science suggests that the act of intentionally connecting in real time you know kind of what we are doing right now where we are i am talking to you and you are hearing me in real time
YOU1000000117_S0000100	that can be almost as good as a regular social connection and so we should be embracing these a lot more
YOU1000000117_S0000101	i think another thing you can do if you are living alone is to embrace the kinds of things that solitude gives you in terms of other mental health benefits
YOU1000000117_S0000102	so i am thinking about things like quiet time for meditation
YOU1000000117_S0000103	or even alone time so that you can engage in a little bit more exercise you know
YOU1000000117_S0000104	grab a yoga mat even from a small apartment and do one of the many free online exercise classes that are coming now
YOU1000000117_S0000105	i think if you are alone in this crisis it can actually provide some time to reset things and focus on your own mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000106	in a way that might be tricky if you are not sort of sheltering in place in that very strange situation
YOU1000000117_S0000108	and so that was tracy is question now we are moving on to bree bree is asking how can we stay focused sane and productive at work
YOU1000000117_S0000109	particularly with the big elephant in the room which is the threat of layoffs
YOU1000000117_S0000110	this is another really huge one and i think i want to start with this question 1st by validating it
YOU1000000117_S0000111	yeah a lot of us are facing the possibility of being laid off from work having less hours
YOU1000000117_S0000112	in addition to this physical crisis and this mental health crisis a lot of us are facing a real economic crisis and that is incredibly scary
YOU1000000117_S0000113	and so i think the 1st thing is to just have some self compassion with yourself about the fact that we are going through this
YOU1000000117_S0000114	i am experiencing this now with many of my graduate and phd students
YOU1000000117_S0000115	who feel like they should be working and being just as productive as before but that can not possibly be true because we are in the midst of a pandemic where everyone is stressed
YOU1000000117_S0000116	and even if we are reacting to it really well one day that does not mean that the next day we will not feel it really deeply and be unable to work
YOU1000000117_S0000117	and so i think the 1st piece of advice is just to allow yourself some self compassion
YOU1000000117_S0000118	you give yourself the same self compassion as you would give to a friend who is going through that sort of same thing
YOU1000000117_S0000119	all of us right now are going to be a little less productive than usual
YOU1000000117_S0000120	the 2nd piece of advice is actually to remember some of the causal arrows you have heard about on the podcast and in my class
YOU1000000117_S0000121	in other words that we often think that productivity we need to figure out 1st and then we will be happy because we will be productive at work
YOU1000000117_S0000122	but the research actually suggests the other arrow in other words that by focusing on our mental health during this time it can actually increase our productivity
YOU1000000117_S0000123	and so that would be the direction i suggest you think about going what can you do to reduce your anxiety right now
YOU1000000117_S0000124	to bump up your social connections so you feel a little bit more like connected and trusting about your community
YOU1000000117_S0000125	what can you do to increase a little bit of exercise lately those types of things will bump up your mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000126	and by focusing on that you will end up increasing your productivity separately
YOU1000000117_S0000127	and so those would be my kind of productivity tips 1st of all just like it is not going to be the same
YOU1000000117_S0000128	no one is is going to be the same and in some ways the whole world is in this boat
YOU1000000117_S0000129	so kind of lay off yourself of the guilt a little bit because we are kind of all going through it
YOU1000000117_S0000130	and the 2nd is that if you really want to focus on productivity you need to give yourself some space to do the things that will really help your mental health too
YOU1000000117_S0000131	okay so that was from brie now we have a similar question from angela who is asked maybe more specifically i have been laid off because of covid 19
YOU1000000117_S0000132	how do i do the soul searching necessary to figure out what i want to do next and what jobs and industries are going to be fulfilling
YOU1000000117_S0000133	i think again this is one of these ways of using the negative things in life to sort of see the blessings inside of them
YOU1000000117_S0000134	again losing your job is an awful thing to have happen and it comes with a lot of uncertainties
YOU1000000117_S0000135	but it also brings with it the possibility of new directions
YOU1000000117_S0000136	like you can start thinking more about what are the things that you found meaningful about your job
YOU1000000117_S0000137	what are the types of things that you would like to build into a job that is coming next
YOU1000000117_S0000138	again so many of us are in this crisis right now and going through these things
YOU1000000117_S0000139	but also all of us or most of us are going to get through to the other side
YOU1000000117_S0000140	when we are in the crux of it it is hard to think that there is going to be another side because right now we are just facing uncertainty of kind of you know what is inside and what does that mean
YOU1000000117_S0000141	but like all crises we are going to get to the other side
YOU1000000117_S0000142	and even those of you who are going through economic and other strife right now are going to find other options when you get out
YOU1000000117_S0000143	and i think you can use this time to do some real soul searching
YOU1000000117_S0000144	one of the blessings of being in a position of maybe losing your job or losing some hours at work
YOU1000000117_S0000145	is that you wind up having a time windfall you wind up having more time
YOU1000000117_S0000146	and that means that you can have the blessing of having what is called time affluence the sort of feeling of being wealthy in time
YOU1000000117_S0000147	if you can kind of get around the uncertainty of having the extra time it can actually be a really powerful time to do things like take time to journal about what you find most meaningful
YOU1000000117_S0000148	or engage in the kinds of strategies that researchers like amy reznicki and others use to job craft
YOU1000000117_S0000149	to really think about what you find most meaningful in your work and sort of plan that moving forward
YOU1000000117_S0000150	if you are taking the class angela i would also suggest this is a great time to go back to that strengths test that you might recall
YOU1000000117_S0000151	trying to focus on your character strengths and getting a sense of what those are that might be a good time to figure out what parts of your work are mapping on to those strengths
YOU1000000117_S0000152	and if you are looking for work in the future what you could do that kind of builds those up in an even more robust way
YOU1000000117_S0000153	okay so that was a question from angela we are cruising through all these questions thank you so much for sending in all these great ones
YOU1000000117_S0000154	the next one up is from jessica jessica notes i have been doing okay so far but one of my children has been really sad about missing school and his friends is there any way i can help him
YOU1000000117_S0000155	and again just start by just validating this you know this is a scary and uncertain and an anxiety provoking time for us
YOU1000000117_S0000156	it is so much worse for our children right who really just do not have the kind of frontal lobe tools to regulate about this crisis
YOU1000000117_S0000157	and so i think anything you can do to help their anxiety their uncertainty can be incredibly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000158	the 1st tip i would give for helping kids during this tough time is to make sure that they have a routine
YOU1000000117_S0000159	one of the problems about being out of school and out of the typical day that kids face is that they are used to having a certain routine and now it has gone away
YOU1000000117_S0000160	and we as humans are creatures of habit like we kind of work best and feel less anxious when we are in a consistent schedule and a consistent routine
YOU1000000117_S0000162	so even if your kids are not in a consistent schedule right now you should make one up for them
YOU1000000117_S0000163	you should find a way that you know like breakfasts from 9 to 10 and from 10 to 11
YOU1000000117_S0000164	you know you are doing your math homework or maybe you are watching cartoons or maybe you get to play video games it kind of does not matter
YOU1000000117_S0000165	but just have a consistent schedule that you end up kind of announcing to your kids and sticking with
YOU1000000117_S0000166	the other piece of advice i would give is again to do the same thing that we need to do when we are feeling anxious and we are feeling stressed and we are feeling sad in other words the same types of tips i was just talking about
YOU1000000117_S0000167	kids too can benefit from having social connection through things like zoom and so on
YOU1000000117_S0000168	for older kids that can be the same way we do it as adults
YOU1000000117_S0000169	but even for younger kids that can be the kind of thing that you set up and structure
YOU1000000117_S0000170	my colleague jamil zaki who is a social psychologist who was on the happiness lab podcast
YOU1000000117_S0000171	he has really younger kids and he notes that he and his friends are setting up play dates over zoom
YOU1000000117_S0000172	they are kind of going online and printing out the same coloring pages so that kids can color together color the same thing
YOU1000000117_S0000173	across the way across zoom and that can be really powerful kind of giving this structure of social connection back to your kids when they need it
YOU1000000117_S0000174	but another thing to build in i think would be to allow kids to see that again this is not all doom and gloom
YOU1000000117_S0000175	if you look like there are heroes and real stories of kindness out there
YOU1000000117_S0000176	and so another tip would be to kind of expose your kids to the fact that there are good things happening
YOU1000000117_S0000177	tell them your stories about covid kindness that you are reading about in the news
YOU1000000117_S0000178	talk to them about the heroes that are doing great things
YOU1000000117_S0000179	and allow them to experience the fact that there is good stuff out there as well
YOU1000000117_S0000180	i think the 3rd and final tip is that you being the head of the house are going to have a huge emotional impact on your kids
YOU1000000117_S0000181	if you have listened to past episodes of the happiness lab you have heard about cases of emotional contagion
YOU1000000117_S0000182	and the fact that we are often part of these affective spirals
YOU1000000117_S0000183	where one member of our team or our families feels a certain way feels panicky and then that panic can be contagious and it transmits and it gets worse
YOU1000000117_S0000184	remember that you can be the calm in the storm for your kids you know if you take time to regulate your own anxiety you know do your own deep breaths before you face them
YOU1000000117_S0000185	if you are describing this situation as a challenge not a crisis you are going to transmit that calm and those positive states to them
YOU1000000117_S0000186	and that can be incredibly important one of the best things you can do right now to help your community is to be embodying those positive emotions yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000187	and that often means doing the right things to protect your own well being the kinds of things that we have been talking about
YOU1000000117_S0000188	okay so that was one from jessica now we are moving on to one from lindsay
YOU1000000117_S0000189	lindsay asks in your course we learned about how experiences and not things make us happy
YOU1000000117_S0000190	in this time of social distancing and self quarantine are there any suggestions you have for experiences we could create independently or with our families
YOU1000000117_S0000191	i love this question in part because it is you know doing all the things that i suggest right which is like being proactive
YOU1000000117_S0000192	you know using the topics that we have heard about in the course and the interventions we have seen in the course in this special time
YOU1000000117_S0000193	i think one of the odd but great things about this current time is that we are all in a new situation
YOU1000000117_S0000194	like we are all faced with being at home in a way we have not been before we have more time with our kids more time with our families and things like that
YOU1000000117_S0000195	all the research in psychology suggests that we can harness these new situations to form new different habits
YOU1000000117_S0000196	in other words we can start things that we had not tried before you know new game nights new family dinners new traditions
YOU1000000117_S0000197	all of these things because we are in this moment where we start a new situation
YOU1000000117_S0000198	are easy to harness we can harness what are called fresh starts which is some wonderful research by katie milfman and others
YOU1000000117_S0000199	shows that these new situations and these new moments of fresh starts allow us to form habits better
YOU1000000117_S0000200	and so i think this is a time to think about what creative experiences you could come up with with your family
YOU1000000117_S0000201	you know maybe you start cooking dinner with your family in a different way maybe you start zooming you know grandma and grandpa into your zoom meetings
YOU1000000117_S0000202	maybe you all engage in a yoga class or some crazy exercise together
YOU1000000117_S0000203	maybe this is the time to start that gratitude you know 3 good things that you list before dinner with your family
YOU1000000117_S0000204	all these things are easier to start they are experiences that are easier to get going
YOU1000000117_S0000205	because we do not really have norms of what our families are supposed to do during this time it is so new
YOU1000000117_S0000206	and that provides this real opportunity if you can harness it to put good things in place for yourself and for your family
YOU1000000117_S0000207	and so i think for those experiences you know get really creative and that can be with your kids but it can also be with your spouses
YOU1000000117_S0000208	you know we can not necessarily go out on the typical boring dinner dates or go to that same restaurant you went to every single week
YOU1000000117_S0000209	so try something new whether that is a new spot in the house to have dinner a new candle put down a tablecloth try a new meal
YOU1000000117_S0000210	you can create these novel experiences and if you frame these things as novel experiences that can be powerful for your wellbeing as well
YOU1000000117_S0000211	okay so that was lindsay is question moving on we are really scrolling through so i am encouraging you again to send in your questions if you have not yet we have about 10 more minutes in this chat so send them in
YOU1000000117_S0000212	next question comes from cheryl and cheryl asks what should we do about sleep problems i can not sleep anxiety uncertainty etc
YOU1000000117_S0000213	cheryl you are really speaking to me because i was going through this pretty badly about last week
YOU1000000117_S0000214	when i was just realizing that i just was unable to kind of fall asleep
YOU1000000117_S0000215	even though i was trying to get to bed at a reasonable hour my mind was like
YOU1000000117_S0000217	it was really really hard
YOU1000000117_S0000219	and so i will share with you the things that i have done to promote sleep and they are all things that come from the research
YOU1000000117_S0000220	one of these is to harness the power of ritual before you go to sleep
YOU1000000117_S0000221	there is lots of fantastic work by mike norton and francesca gino showing the power of ritual to control things when things feel out of control
YOU1000000117_S0000222	and i think right now one of the things that is preventing us from sleeping is that everything feels really out of control
YOU1000000117_S0000223	and so i have started some seemingly dumb private sleep rituals i kind of set up at night and kind of remake my bed if my bed was not made before
YOU1000000117_S0000224	i found all the old lotions that i have in my cabinet that i have not used in a while
YOU1000000117_S0000225	like every night before i go to bed i kind of like you know put some lotion on and try to be really mindful about the way it smells and the way it feels and kind of get into bed it sounds really silly
YOU1000000117_S0000226	but harnessing this ritual the science suggests can kind of make you feel a little bit more in control
YOU1000000117_S0000227	and it can also train your body that like 0 wait after i do the ritual of the lotion then i go to bed
YOU1000000117_S0000228	a 2nd thing that i have done and this is probably then even more powerful is to really regulate how much anxiety provoking material i am looking at right before i go to bed
YOU1000000117_S0000229	i know i have told lots of you about the dangers of phones and particularly the dangers of phones right before you go to sleep
YOU1000000117_S0000230	but this is a time where we really need to be following that advice
YOU1000000117_S0000231	basically i have a rule now that after 8 pm i put my phone away i just put it on silent
YOU1000000117_S0000232	i put it in a specific spot in my bedroom and i am not allowed to use it anymore
YOU1000000117_S0000233	which is tricky for me because i am really used to kind of scrolling and using my phone before i go to bed
YOU1000000117_S0000234	but i have tried to substitute that habit with something else because as we know from our habit research if you have a cue but no action to do it can be really hard to overcome a bad habit from before
YOU1000000117_S0000235	and so my new habit when i have the cue of like 0 i really want to check my phone before bed is a physical book i have just found old books in my house that i either want to read or were sitting on that shelf and i have not had a chance to yet and those are there
YOU1000000117_S0000236	and so those different habits of kind of beginning a sort of sleep ritual that is like healthier
YOU1000000117_S0000237	and getting rid of the phone which is bad because of its light but also because on the other end of that phone right now there is a lot of anxiety provoking content that can be really powerful for me
YOU1000000117_S0000238	and i guess maybe the 3rd thing is just to prioritize it
YOU1000000117_S0000239	i have been trying to you know given that we all have a little bit many of us have a little bit more flexibility with our work time
YOU1000000117_S0000240	i have been really trying to move any work meetings that are early in the morning to a little bit later
YOU1000000117_S0000241	so even if i can not get to sleep or i am having some restless sleep i have a little bit more time to make it up these days
YOU1000000117_S0000242	and so highly highly encourage you to prioritize sleep remember sleep essential for your mental health but it is also one of the other things you can do right now to protect your immune function
YOU1000000117_S0000243	during a time when we all really need to make sure our immune function is as high and as effective as it can possibly be
YOU1000000117_S0000244	okay so up next question marisol is here and she is asking
YOU1000000117_S0000245	i have a couple of family members that have tested positive for covid 19 i feel like my mind is focused only on that so how do you suppose i go about my day with caring for my family but also taking care of my own mental health
YOU1000000117_S0000246	i think this is again i will start by doing i think what is important here which is to validate this
YOU1000000117_S0000247	many of us are going through the situation where we know people who are positive for covid 19 or presume positive for covid 19 i think a different scarier situation where you can not get tested
YOU1000000117_S0000248	and that is incredibly scary and sometimes that comes with the additionally awful thing that if you are trying to physically distance yourself or if you are in a vulnerable position yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000249	you might not even be able to help them in the normal way because you might need to maintain some distance from them
YOU1000000117_S0000250	and so i think the 1st thing to do with this is to have some self compassion this is an unprecedentedly bad situation
YOU1000000117_S0000251	and you kind of just need to be nice to yourself and stop feeling guilty
YOU1000000117_S0000252	if you are in the position where you want to be helping your family members and are feeling frustrated that you can not interact with them directly
YOU1000000117_S0000253	this is for people who for example have family members who are far away or family members who are vulnerable that you can not get to
YOU1000000117_S0000254	i think one thing the research suggests you can do to help with that is to allow those pro social urges to come out another way are there other elderly family members you can help
YOU1000000117_S0000255	or something else you can do that is doing good in the world even if you can not do good for that one person i think that can be particularly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000256	but in terms of just going through that situation with family members i think part of it is to find ways to reduce your own sympathetic nervous system activity
YOU1000000117_S0000257	i think the stress of having family members who are sick on our own bodies can be incredibly anxiety provoking
YOU1000000117_S0000258	and i think you need to just take time to kind of breathe and again we talked a little bit before about kind of doing these slower breaths these belly breaths we are talking a lot about on our podcast and things
YOU1000000117_S0000259	that is the time to do that deep breathing
YOU1000000117_S0000260	because it is going to help your own immune function it is going to sort of shut off the fight or flight sympathetic nervous system activity
YOU1000000117_S0000261	and allow you to turn on this parasympathetic nervous activity which is what we need right now the sort of rest and digest and that will help your immune function
YOU1000000117_S0000262	but it will also give you the bandwidth to deal with that stressful situation
YOU1000000117_S0000263	remember even if it does not feel like it there is a lot that you can do to embody calm yourself in order to help the other people in your life
YOU1000000117_S0000264	and so very very hard and scary situation completely validating that
YOU1000000117_S0000265	but again know that there is simple actions you can take to kind of take control of your own emotions and sort of work with them even in this really scary time
YOU1000000117_S0000267	final question because we are kind of at time our final question comes from holly
YOU1000000117_S0000268	who asks that her question is around trying to do random acts of kindness and make social connections during this time
YOU1000000117_S0000269	she has a few ideas in mind but it is hard to find ways in everyday life when you are in isolation to do this more
YOU1000000117_S0000270	i agree completely in the course and on the podcast we talk a lot about these
YOU1000000117_S0000271	kind of random social connections you know the chatting with the barista social connections that happen regularly this is the stuff that we are missing more and more now
YOU1000000117_S0000272	and so one of the tips i have been giving is to try to build in social connection that is not the like very formal conference call with the folks at work but really informal type things
YOU1000000117_S0000273	you know like i am going to do a yoga class just like call you know text a few friends and say hey who wants to jump in with me
YOU1000000117_S0000274	or i am going to have a half hour where i am chopping vegetables and trying to deal with whatever is in my pantry to cook tonight
YOU1000000117_S0000275	let me see if i can zoom a friend who can jump in with me then
YOU1000000117_S0000276	i think these informal social interactions can be incredibly powerful
YOU1000000117_S0000277	we have to intentionally build them in in a way that we did not before the 2 things there one is that just takes a little bit more work
YOU1000000117_S0000278	and the 2nd thing is if you form the right habit now you might be able to import that later
YOU1000000117_S0000279	so that when this whole crisis is over you are doing those things as well
YOU1000000117_S0000280	in terms of the random acts of kindness part i think there are so many things we can be doing to reach out to others
YOU1000000117_S0000281	one is just to recognize that this act of sheltering in place staying home is a pro social action you are helping other people and helping to flatten the curve
YOU1000000117_S0000282	maybe saving the 1000s of lives by your simple action so make sure you reframe it that way
YOU1000000117_S0000283	but the other thing is to use whatever windfalls you have whether that is extra time because you are not working as much
YOU1000000117_S0000284	or a little financial windfall you know those of you who are not paying gas to commute or buying that coffee at the coffee shop regularly that you normally buy
YOU1000000117_S0000285	those are little financial windfalls that you can use to help other people
YOU1000000117_S0000286	and so what can you use to use that money to say help local businesses who need some help or if you just have extra time what can you do to kind of contact elderly family members who might need a connection right now
YOU1000000117_S0000287	or even talk to your congresspeople about what they should be doing like these are the times when we can use our temporal windfalls our time windfalls to help other people a lot
YOU1000000117_S0000288	okay i think that was a lot i hope that you heard some fantastic suggestions
YOU1000000117_S0000289	i want you to keep in mind the main thing that i keep mentioning which is self compassion
YOU1000000117_S0000290	this is a really challenging time and it is important to be nice to yourself
YOU1000000117_S0000291	but one of the things you can do to be nice to yourself is to remember what science suggests about the kinds of things that can improve your well being
YOU1000000117_S0000292	we know that you are washing your hands and doing good stuff for your physical health i hope this has given you a bunch of tips for what you can do for your mental health too
YOU1000000117_S0000293	there is so many comments on there sending gratitude my way thank you so much you are very welcome
YOU1000000117_S0000294	i hope this has given you some useful tips and i thank you for signing on thank you all so much
YOU1000000118_S0000001	we start the specialization with this course
YOU1000000118_S0000002	how google does ml where i introduce machine learning and what google means when we say we are ai 1st
YOU1000000118_S0000003	my colleague josh then comes in to talk about the strategy of machine learning
YOU1000000118_S0000004	we end with a discussion of tooling of how to do machine learning at scale using python notebooks and serverless data processing components
YOU1000000118_S0000006	now if you are an engineer or a scientist you are probably thinking that this is all too high level
YOU1000000118_S0000007	and you are ready to jump to the next course which starts to delve into technical details of tensorflow but before you make that decision let me tell you something
YOU1000000118_S0000008	when we taught this set of courses to our customers
YOU1000000118_S0000009	one remark that often came back was that the module by josh was the one they revisited the most often
YOU1000000118_S0000011	after they went back to work 6 months later the module that they went to look at the most was on the strategy of machine learning
YOU1000000118_S0000012	so you want to get the big picture before you delve into the technical details
YOU1000000118_S0000013	because the big picture is very important for you to be able to get buy in from the rest of the organization to carry out
YOU1000000118_S0000014	we then move on to doing machine learning with tensorflow that involves 2 aspects
YOU1000000118_S0000015	one creating a good machine learning dataset and 2 building your 1st machine learning model with tensorflow
YOU1000000118_S0000016	creating a machine learning data set is another of those practical modules that you do not want to ignore
YOU1000000118_S0000017	when you create a machine learning model and it works well in your experiments but then fails miserably in production
YOU1000000118_S0000018	the reason will often come back to how you created the machine learning dataset so give yourself time to absorb the lessons
YOU1000000118_S0000019	and then we have 2 courses that are about improving machine learning accuracy
YOU1000000118_S0000020	as you build your 1st machine learning model you will learn that there are lots of things you can do to improve that model
YOU1000000118_S0000021	so think of this section as filling your tool chest with a set of ideas
YOU1000000118_S0000022	you will use different ideas in different situations so you will find that knowing them will be helpful in your career as you solve different machine learning problems
YOU1000000118_S0000023	and as before it is not enough to just name check these concepts you need to give yourself time to understand them
YOU1000000118_S0000024	and know how to implement them in code we then move on to a set of courses that are about operationalizing the machine learning model
YOU1000000118_S0000025	as i mentioned earlier operationalizing a machine learning model
YOU1000000118_S0000026	and by that i mean training it at scale in a distributed way serving out the predictions
YOU1000000118_S0000027	building a machine learning model end to end operationalizing a machine learning model can be super hard
YOU1000000118_S0000028	it is a stage where most enterprise machine learning projects fail
YOU1000000118_S0000029	i cannot tell you how many companies i have talked to who have said their innovation teams had devised these cool ml projects but they were struggling getting the ml models into production
YOU1000000118_S0000030	in this set of courses we will talk about how to train deploy and predict with ml models in a way that they are production ready
YOU1000000118_S0000031	and finally we delve back into machine learning theory but theory in big air quotes
YOU1000000118_S0000032	machine learning theory is mostly heuristics machine learning is an intensely heuristic discipline
YOU1000000118_S0000033	and you are only as good as your bag of tools and tricks
YOU1000000118_S0000034	so we will introduce a number of tools and tricks that work when the inputs to your machine learning models are images
YOU1000000118_S0000036	tools and tricks that help in your processing or outputting sequences
YOU1000000118_S0000037	and sequences in machine learning can be either time series data or text data
YOU1000000118_S0000038	and finally we will look at several ways to build powerful recommendation systems
YOU1000000118_S0000039	recommendation systems are how you build personalized algorithms
YOU1000000118_S0000040	and so it is something that most ml engineers build at some point in their careers
YOU1000000118_S0000041	in fact it might be the only ml system that many people will build
YOU1000000118_S0000042	but in order to build powerful recommendation engines it turns out that you need to understand tools and tricks
YOU1000000118_S0000043	that are borrowed from images and from sequences
YOU1000000118_S0000044	so that is why we are looking at them in this order and that is why we look at recommendation engines pretty much at the end of the specialization
YOU1000000118_S0000045	now you may have encountered some of this material before especially in the 1st 4 courses
YOU1000000118_S0000046	for example in the courses on creating machine learning datasets
YOU1000000118_S0000047	and on tensorflow basics some of the slides will be a repeat of serverless machine learning with tensorflow that is available in coursera
YOU1000000118_S0000048	similarly if you encountered google is machine learning crash course this is an internal google course but it has also been taught on some university campuses
YOU1000000118_S0000049	you might find some of the material and feature representation and art and science of ml to be familiar
YOU1000000118_S0000051	in spite of this though the details are quite different so do not skip it completely
YOU1000000118_S0000052	treat these courses as a useful refresher and make sure that you still remember the ideas presented in those sections
YOU1000000119_S0000001	welcome to the 1st course in the blockchain specialization titled blockchain basics
YOU1000000119_S0000002	let us start by asking ourselves what is a blockchain why should you care about it
YOU1000000119_S0000003	unlike traditional methods blockchain enables peer to peer transfer of digital assets without any intermediaries
YOU1000000119_S0000004	it was a technology originally created to support the famous cryptocurrency bitcoin
YOU1000000119_S0000005	the blockchain by itself has taken a life of its own and permeated a broad range of applications across many industries including finance healthcare government manufacturing and distribution
YOU1000000119_S0000006	the blockchain is poised to innovate and transform a wide range of applications including goods transfer for example supply chain digital media transfer for example sale of art
YOU1000000119_S0000007	remote services delivery example travel and tourism platform for decentralized business logic for example moving computing to data sources
YOU1000000119_S0000008	and distributed intelligence example education and credentialing
YOU1000000119_S0000009	additional applications of blockchain include distributed resources for example power generation and distribution
YOU1000000119_S0000010	crowdfunding for example startup fundraising crowd operation for example electronic voting identity management for example one id for all your life is functions
YOU1000000119_S0000011	and government public records and open governing
YOU1000000119_S0000013	moreover blockchain can enable an inclusive economy it can enable a person in a remote corner of the world to partake in a democratic process
YOU1000000119_S0000014	opportunities for innovative applications are endless
YOU1000000119_S0000015	there is a dire need for critical thinkers designers and developers who can envision and create newer application models on blockchain to benefit the world
YOU1000000119_S0000016	this course is a 1st step in addressing this need
YOU1000000119_S0000017	at the end of this course you will be able to explain the 3 fundamental characteristics that define the blockchain using bitcoin blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000018	bitcoin is not the only player in town by the end of the 1st module we will move beyond bitcoin into introducing the next generation blockchains with ethereum
YOU1000000119_S0000020	you will also be able to discuss the important features of ethereum blockchain that is used as a reference implementation in many newer blockchains
YOU1000000119_S0000021	and explain the algorithms and techniques that enable the blockchain including a public key cryptography and hashing
YOU1000000119_S0000022	finally you will be able to outline methods for realizing trust in a blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000024	let us begin with an introduction of bitcoin
YOU1000000119_S0000025	2 major contributions of cryptocurrency bitcoin are a continuously working digital currency system and a model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000027	though our focus is on a general blockchain we have to understand the working of the technology behind bitcoin to fully appreciate the innovation of blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000029	we can all agree that the advent of the internet and the world wide web has transformed every aspect of our lives from stock markets to street corner food trucks
YOU1000000119_S0000030	it has enabled the technology explosion with web 2 and the world of e commerce applications
YOU1000000119_S0000031	around 2008 2009 when the institutions and markets we trusted were crumbling down and everybody was running away from the wall street
YOU1000000119_S0000032	a mysterious person or persons called satoshi nakamoto introduced a new digital currency a cryptocurrency called bitcoin
YOU1000000119_S0000034	bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority
YOU1000000119_S0000036	with no central authority how did bitcoin realize trust and security
YOU1000000119_S0000037	by implementing software programs for validation verification consensus in a novel infrastructure called the blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000039	later on in about 2012 2013 computational elements were added to the blockchain infrastructure
YOU1000000119_S0000040	that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer
YOU1000000119_S0000041	these innovations are significantly shaping the direction of web 3 as you will learn in the next 4 courses
YOU1000000119_S0000043	what is a blockchain blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network
YOU1000000119_S0000044	establishing trust among unknown peers
YOU1000000119_S0000045	recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger
YOU1000000119_S0000047	let us understand centralized versus decentralized network using a common scenario
YOU1000000119_S0000048	consider a scenario where a customer wants to buy an item using her credit card
YOU1000000119_S0000050	let us enumerate the intermediaries involved in accomplishing this task
YOU1000000119_S0000051	we have a credit card agency we have a customer bank we have a credit cards bank we have an exchange we have the merchants bank and finally the merchant
YOU1000000119_S0000053	this is an example of a centralized system that we are so used to
YOU1000000119_S0000054	now compare this with a system where peers can transact directly with each other irrespective of where they are located
YOU1000000119_S0000056	functions of the intermediaries are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in the blockchain infrastructure
YOU1000000119_S0000057	peers are not necessarily known to each other this is a decentralized system
YOU1000000119_S0000058	how do we establish trust among the peers in such a decentralized system
YOU1000000119_S0000059	by having a process in place to validate verify and confirm transactions
YOU1000000119_S0000060	record the transaction in a distributed ledger of blocks
YOU1000000119_S0000061	create a tamper proof record of blocks chain of blocks
YOU1000000119_S0000063	and implement a consensus protocol for agreement on the block to be added to the chain
YOU1000000119_S0000064	so validation verification consensus and immutable recording lead to the trust and security of the blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000066	now i will explain these concepts using another scenario
YOU1000000119_S0000068	i am lending amy $10000 this is one single peer to peer transaction
YOU1000000119_S0000069	we both make a note of it on a ledger
YOU1000000119_S0000070	what if i change my entry from 10000 to 11000
YOU1000000119_S0000071	alternatively amy changes hers from 10000 to 1000
YOU1000000119_S0000072	to prevent this trust violation we need to seek the help of people around us lisa allison and francis
YOU1000000119_S0000073	provide all of them a valid copy of this lecture
YOU1000000119_S0000074	this is the basic concept of an immutable distributed ledger defined in a blockchain process
YOU1000000119_S0000076	in this scenario we were all physically present in one location amherst
YOU1000000119_S0000077	now imagine this to be an online transaction
YOU1000000119_S0000078	to an unknown peer also scale up the one transaction to 10000 transactions how about a 10 transactions
YOU1000000119_S0000079	i should be able to transact with equal ease to any unknown peer in amherst albany or albania
YOU1000000119_S0000080	maybe to send some flowers to a friend in albania this is the tenet of a decentralized system supported by blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000082	in the case just described how do we trust our unknown peers
YOU1000000119_S0000083	through verification and validation in our example amy requests kevin to verify the amount i transacted with her
YOU1000000119_S0000085	kevin checks it oops kevin finds the amount of transaction is not 10000 but 300 not valid
YOU1000000119_S0000086	kevin rejects and nullifies the transaction similar to this validation and verification methods defined by the blockchain
YOU1000000119_S0000087	and implemented by the peers provide the collective trust needed in a decentralized system
YOU1000000119_S0000088	summarizing blockchain technology supports methods for a decentralized peer to peer system a collective trust model
YOU1000000119_S0000089	and the distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions
YOU1000000120_S0000001	i am back
YOU1000000120_S0000003	how is it going guys to everyone at kings langley school i hope you are all well
YOU1000000120_S0000005	i came to kings langley school when i was a teenager my name is anthony joshua i know how tough it is for you guys right now at home i know you are doing all your lessons live
YOU1000000120_S0000006	i commend you i know it is not easy but your commitment will pay off but it is also important to keep yourself active keep the mind active and keep the body active mister fisher is actually employed me
YOU1000000120_S0000007	so i have come down here especially this morning to put in my time and give you a workout plan i was actually taught by mister annette i know he has got a hiit class for you guys
YOU1000000120_S0000008	so mister annette make sure you warm up you cool down because you are definitely going to be sore tomorrow
YOU1000000120_S0000009	but i just want to say how privileged you guys are to have teachers who care and love and support you that are actually on this journey with you it is not only just for you
YOU1000000120_S0000010	your brothers your sisters your aunties your uncles mums and dads this is for everyone to get involved and keep active
YOU1000000120_S0000011	i may not be the joe wicks of the industry i actually tied him up and he is in the corner i am just joking i am just joking
YOU1000000120_S0000012	this is just something i have come up with something simple straightforward and we are going to progress as the weeks go on so before you pick up your playstation or xbox controller
YOU1000000120_S0000013	before you pick up your phone and go on social media let us get to work before we start i just want to say you can do this bodyweight if you want but for someone like me .
YOU1000000120_S0000015	i prefer to use some equipment around the house so what i have here
YOU1000000120_S0000017	is actually a king langley school bus
YOU1000000120_S0000019	pride and honor so i am going to take this i am going to open it up
YOU1000000120_S0000020	and i am going to fill it up with some stuff that i have got around the house so for me
YOU1000000120_S0000022	as i love boxing i have got my boxing gloves here so i am going to shove them in the bag i have got some towels do not tell mum or dad but we are going to go to the cupboard and get some
YOU1000000120_S0000023	coconut milk some peeled tomatoes i am going to zip this up now
YOU1000000120_S0000024	as heavy as you want you dictate and we are going to use this as equipment that we can use to add weight to our workout we are going to aim to do as many rounds as you can
YOU1000000120_S0000025	within 10 minutes but it is important to remember your scores so you can come back to it day in and day out and try and improve so get ready to screenshot the workout
YOU1000000120_S0000026	so you can try this at home
YOU1000000120_S0000028	this exercise is what we call a front squat i want you to keep your back straight your shoulders engaged and i want you to do the movement nice and controlled
YOU1000000120_S0000029	and go down as far as you possibly can
YOU1000000120_S0000031	that exercise is engaging your legs your quads your hamstrings your glutes your calves and also it is engaging your shoulders so it is a good full body workout
YOU1000000120_S0000032	so in this exercise i want you to put the backpack on your back as if you are going to school and we are going to do a press up backpack on my back glutes are engaged core engaged
YOU1000000120_S0000033	shoulders tight and push
YOU1000000120_S0000035	so just like the squat it engages the full body it is going to engage your triceps it is going to engage your shoulders your chest it is a pushing movement
YOU1000000120_S0000036	but also while you are pushing it is important to keep your core engaged as well so you have got a strong base and also activate your glutes as well if you can
YOU1000000120_S0000038	so this exercise is called reverse lunge with an overhead press so here we have my equipment here so i have taken a bag in my left hand you can use your right hand
YOU1000000120_S0000039	it is up to you what you want to do but also make sure you use the same side leg to reverse lunge so this is an example here so we stand straight good posture
YOU1000000120_S0000040	and i lunge back here but as you can see my knees not touching the ground i want to try and create stability so i am engaging my core my glutes my quads
YOU1000000120_S0000041	and i am going to press up this is causing great instability i am still engaged as i come down i stand up and that is one
YOU1000000120_S0000043	make sure you do both sides
YOU1000000120_S0000045	so in this exercise this is what we call a rowboat into a twist so a rowboat is something like this it is like you are rowing a boat so you are down you are up you are down you are up
YOU1000000120_S0000046	you are down you are up but we are adding a twist into this so i want you to act as if you are doing a reverse plank
YOU1000000120_S0000048	make sure your lower back is engaged it is stuck to the floor
YOU1000000120_S0000050	you are engaging your glutes your core and you row the boat and use your piece of equipment your bag with everything in it and you bring it over to the other side then you go down
YOU1000000120_S0000051	hold back up grab your piece of equipment and bring it to the other side not an easy exercise
YOU1000000120_S0000053	so you do have the opportunity if you would like to
YOU1000000120_S0000055	take out some of these tomatoes
YOU1000000120_S0000057	take our pair of boxing gloves make it easy for you you can adjust the weight the choice is yours
YOU1000000120_S0000062	and i am going to use my left hand to drag this bag from my right side over to my left
YOU1000000120_S0000063	once i have got it over i am going to put this hand back down and i am going to use my right hand to drag the bag from my left side over
YOU1000000120_S0000065	so it is kind of like i am using my hand to draw an x so from one corner to another over from one corner to another and back over
YOU1000000120_S0000067	it is great for engagement in the core it is great to bring your weight down your heart rate up good for lower back pains as well all these exercises can really help
YOU1000000120_S0000068	stimulate muscles that you are not using but are really important for stability in your life in your body whether you do this in the morning whether you do it in the afternoon or evening try and fit this workout somewhere in in the day
YOU1000000120_S0000069	i had fun doing that i hope you guys have as well i hope you are feeling rewarded i hope you can track your progression as well so you can note your achievements down i can not wait to catch up with mister fisher
YOU1000000120_S0000070	and get to know who has been achieving and how you guys have been getting on and let us know your feedback as well so we can always make room for improvements
YOU1000000120_S0000071	so it is time to empty your school bags take your gym equipment out put your school books back in say hello to all the teachers as well make sure you focus on your maths and your english even if you are a little bit tired the day is nearly done keep up the good work guys and i will see you soon
YOU1000000121_S0000001	from the side i am stepping back on my right leg for a double bounce 12 and then left
YOU1000000121_S0000002	one 2 one 2 one 2
YOU1000000121_S0000003	so essentially what i am doing here is just switching the feet and from the back starting on the right leg for double bounce
YOU1000000121_S0000005	one 2 transfer one 2 one 2
YOU1000000121_S0000006	one 2 from the side back on the right
YOU1000000121_S0000008	12121212
YOU1000000121_S0000009	so just be careful when you are in this position here that you do not have your weight on that front foot because what ends up happening is the step looks like salsa
YOU1000000121_S0000010	so we want to bring the weight back sink down into that back leg
YOU1000000121_S0000011	so when i take my right leg back my weight comes into my right hip i should be able to lift up that front foot
YOU1000000121_S0000012	because all of my weight is in the back leg so with samba you always want to imagine like you are doing a squat or you are sitting down on a chair
YOU1000000121_S0000013	shoulders are back and weight is always backwards so if we start with our right leg back for our double bounce
YOU1000000121_S0000014	we do not want to bring the weight forward so back
YOU1000000121_S0000016	and back
YOU1000000121_S0000018	back
YOU1000000121_S0000020	and back
YOU1000000121_S0000022	so from the front let us pick up the pace a little more and 121212
YOU1000000121_S0000023	see how i am switching the feet weight is always back switch
YOU1000000121_S0000025	switch switch switch let us try from the side so you can see my feet
YOU1000000121_S0000027	and switch switch double bounce
YOU1000000121_S0000029	1212 from the back right leg back
YOU1000000121_S0000031	12121212
YOU1000000121_S0000032	and to the side right leg back
YOU1000000121_S0000033	one 2 one 2 one 2 okay so that is our basic step
YOU1000000121_S0000034	now we are going to add arms to this step so when i step back on the right leg i am going to bend my right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000035	so from the back stepping back on the right leg bending the right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000036	when i step back on the left leg i bend my left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000037	right leg right arm left leg left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000038	so let us try this from the front back on the right leg bending the right arm back on the left leg bending the left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000039	right leg right arm left leg left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000040	okay so remember that little tip step back on the right leg we are bending the right arm back on the left leg bending the left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000041	so now we are going to add our double bounce to that
YOU1000000121_S0000043	so let us start just with 4 double bounces to get into the rhythm
YOU1000000121_S0000045	and 2
YOU1000000121_S0000047	and 3
YOU1000000121_S0000049	and 4 adding arms
YOU1000000121_S0000051	right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000053	left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000055	right arm
YOU1000000121_S0000057	left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000059	from the front back on the right so 4 basic double bounces
YOU1000000121_S0000060	think about your posture here shoulders back tummy in keep bending the knees
YOU1000000121_S0000061	let us add arms right leg right arm left leg left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000063	good 4
YOU1000000121_S0000065	3
YOU1000000121_S0000067	2
YOU1000000121_S0000069	and one
YOU1000000121_S0000071	double bounce a little faster let us go and 12121212
YOU1000000121_S0000072	another 4 and then we will add arms 32 relax the arms and right arm left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000073	right and left right left right and left
YOU1000000121_S0000074	so from the front 8 double bounces starting back on the right
YOU1000000121_S0000076	go and 12345678910
YOU1000000121_S0000078	34
YOU1000000121_S0000080	567 get ready for arms right leg right arm right arm left arm
YOU1000000121_S0000081	right arm left right left right and left
YOU1000000122_S0000001	take a look at these 2 photos of outer space what do you see they are basically identical but not quite now look a different way in sequence
YOU1000000122_S0000002	here you see something different something moving that dot is a newly discovered world it is closer than we ever thought possible
YOU1000000122_S0000003	and the trick we used to find it could rewrite the story of our cosmic neighborhood
YOU1000000122_S0000005	today scientists have our solar system pretty well mapped out we know about the 8 planets pluto moons asteroids comets
YOU1000000122_S0000006	and until recently we thought we had a handle on our solar neighborhood too
YOU1000000122_S0000008	there is the alpha centauri system about 4 light years away and barnard is star a red dwarf a little farther out
YOU1000000122_S0000009	astronomers made these discoveries more than 100 years ago
YOU1000000122_S0000010	but today some new work is totally upending our view of the neighborhood it involves a space telescope an army of volunteers and a scientist on a very specific mission
YOU1000000122_S0000011	my name is jackie farrity and i am an astrophysicist at the american museum of natural history
YOU1000000122_S0000012	jackie has spent 15 years searching our solar neighborhood for new neighbors
YOU1000000122_S0000013	she is focused on mysterious worlds known as brown dwarfs balls of gas that are too big to be planets but too small to be stars
YOU1000000122_S0000014	now they are often called failed stars but i really dislike the word failure in the title
YOU1000000122_S0000015	because i just feel like it is kind of demeaning to the brown dwarf
YOU1000000122_S0000016	like it needs to be a star it does not care and so oftentimes i call them over excited planets
YOU1000000122_S0000017	brown dwarfs would be stars if they were more massive but without enough hydrogen they do not achieve nuclear fusion
YOU1000000122_S0000018	they emit lots of infrared energy but very little visible light
YOU1000000122_S0000019	so for a long time they were hidden to astronomers but that all changed in the 90s
YOU1000000122_S0000020	infrared technology and infrared telescopes started to come online in earnest and when that happens you start to see these sky surveys
YOU1000000122_S0000021	that are able to produce the wavelengths where you can actually see the brown dwarfs
YOU1000000122_S0000022	the 1st brown dwarfs were id would around 1995 and since then the field has exploded
YOU1000000122_S0000023	today the astronomy community is awash in imagery that could harbor nearby brown dwarfs
YOU1000000122_S0000024	actually finding them is another story but there is an old technique called the blink method that works wonders
YOU1000000122_S0000025	the basic idea is that all stars are in motion relative to us most are so far away that they move imperceptibly
YOU1000000122_S0000026	but objects in our solar neighborhood those are close enough that we can actually catch their movement if we are patient enough
YOU1000000122_S0000027	here are 4 images taken with various telescopes over a span of 32 years
YOU1000000122_S0000028	if you flip or blink through them you see that not everything is staying put
YOU1000000122_S0000029	objects of interest that are in the nearby vicinity they will move they will jump against the background of stars
YOU1000000122_S0000030	that is lumen 16 a pair of brown dwarfs that is only 6.5 light years from earth it was discovered using the blink method in 2013
YOU1000000122_S0000031	and it is now the 3rd closest known system to ours
YOU1000000122_S0000032	we had not changed that list of objects in the top 5 in a century it should not happen
YOU1000000122_S0000033	we should not be finding objects all of a sudden that are spitting distance away from us that we have been missing all this time
YOU1000000122_S0000034	the blink method is not new clyde tombaugh used it to discover pluto back in 1930 and it has been used to discover moons asteroids and dwarf planets
YOU1000000122_S0000035	but paired with new infrared imagery it is slowly bringing our neighborhood into focus a little too slowly really
YOU1000000122_S0000036	a few years back jackie found herself staring down 10s of images that could contain new discoveries it was daunting
YOU1000000122_S0000037	i am spending hours of my time every week blinking images in my spare time
YOU1000000122_S0000038	and i can not it is just it is frustrating it is taking too much time and i will never get through all of it
YOU1000000122_S0000039	the images are noisy and blurry and each one needed real attention it was far too much for any team to handle
YOU1000000122_S0000041	unless that team were 100s of 1000s of people
YOU1000000122_S0000042	and so thus sprung our citizen science project
YOU1000000122_S0000043	at the beginning my girlfriends did not understand why i was looking for just a bunch of moving pixels for hours
YOU1000000122_S0000044	starting in 2017 jackie and her team invited the entire internet to go hunting for brown dwarfs
YOU1000000122_S0000045	their system is dead simple users log into a website and meet their 1st astronomy flipbook
YOU1000000122_S0000046	the images come in a sequence of 4 and it will flip those images flip through time so it shows you what this point in space looked like
YOU1000000122_S0000047	in this year and then a little bit after and then a little after and then a little after
YOU1000000122_S0000048	you will kind of see blue and orange dots typically that are everywhere
YOU1000000122_S0000049	it looks like you are staring at colorful television static
YOU1000000122_S0000050	it can be kind of annoying at 1st if you do not quite know what you are looking for
YOU1000000122_S0000051	but if you are lucky you will catch a mover
YOU1000000122_S0000052	when you finally find something moving it is a bit of an adrenaline rush
YOU1000000122_S0000053	faster moving objects actually do blink across the screen slower ones might just twinkle
YOU1000000122_S0000054	they are basically these little tiny white dots that will flash when you play our flip books
YOU1000000122_S0000055	either way you can mark your anomaly and alert the community
YOU1000000122_S0000057	i think i found something and everyone else kind of is like yeah yeah that is one it is like ah yes i am good i found something
YOU1000000122_S0000058	the most promising leads end up on jackie is radar her team can then book telescope time to look more closely for you citizen scientist it is back to blinking
YOU1000000122_S0000059	it is like in a world it is like a treasure hunt in your couch it is really something that keeps you hooked
YOU1000000122_S0000060	since backyard worlds launched volunteers have been on a tear
YOU1000000122_S0000061	they have discovered 100s 100s of nearby objects
YOU1000000122_S0000062	some were a novel kind of compact frozen world
YOU1000000122_S0000063	prior to backyard worlds there was only 24 of them known they added 5 new ones
YOU1000000122_S0000064	others had surprising new atmospheres
YOU1000000122_S0000065	really strange looking objects
YOU1000000122_S0000066	and still others were hidden siblings of known objects
YOU1000000122_S0000067	i had certainly studied the brown dwarf in the system a lot in previous work and never did i guess that it had a little cold companion with it
YOU1000000122_S0000068	all in 100s of 1000s of users have found more than 1500 new objects
YOU1000000122_S0000069	volunteers like dan and guillaume have gotten credits and academic papers for their discoveries
YOU1000000122_S0000070	there is still more to find jackie thinks the effort could reveal a brown dwarf even closer than alpha centauri
YOU1000000122_S0000071	a new next door neighbor there is even a chance we could find the bigfoot of our solar system planet 9
YOU1000000122_S0000072	there is an object that is theorized to exist beyond pluto that is massive that it could be causing some objects in the outer solar system to be bumped around a bit
YOU1000000122_S0000073	and it is an exciting prospect now does it exist i do not know i am happy that we have citizens that are very interested in trying to find it
YOU1000000122_S0000074	if it is real if it is there and maybe it is
YOU1000000122_S0000076	as successful as the blink method is it has competition artificial intelligence has been huge for astronomers who need to sift through tons of imagery including jackie
YOU1000000122_S0000077	the human eye is beautiful at picking out things
YOU1000000122_S0000078	it is just slow because we have to go image by image and so human eye wins in some ways but ai wins in speed so i use both
YOU1000000122_S0000079	one limitation of ai is that it needs to train using examples of things that it is looking for so if that thing is brand new human brains have the edge
YOU1000000122_S0000080	you are the trained algorithm at that point
YOU1000000122_S0000081	that said astronomy is facing a total wave of data
YOU1000000122_S0000082	in a couple years astronomers will begin imaging the entire night sky of the southern hemisphere twice a week
YOU1000000122_S0000083	there is no way we are looking through all of the data in the classic ways in the coming future like it is over
YOU1000000122_S0000084	for now jackie will take all the help she can get from human volunteers to algorithms the humans are more enthusiastic about it
YOU1000000122_S0000085	you spend countless hours pouring through images and designing custom algorithms and services and you get something great
YOU1000000122_S0000086	it is super exciting to see that all of this work that we put in has an impact
YOU1000000122_S0000087	you can say to yourself yeah it is something i saw
YOU1000000122_S0000088	and i am the 1st human being in the whole history of mankind to see it it is a great feeling
YOU1000000122_S0000090	thank you to lexus for their support be sure to check out the new lexus is by going to lexus com slash is
YOU1000000122_S0000091	their campaign is about going all in on your passion and getting a greater reward which is why they sponsored this series on researchers and innovators
YOU1000000122_S0000092	they do not influence our editorial but they do help make videos like this viable so thanks again to them and thank you for watching
YOU1000000123_S0000000	so how shall i begin this is the blurb for the course
YOU1000000123_S0000001	that has been in the yale catalog for a long time this is a course on finance
YOU1000000123_S0000002	it has the word markets in the name which suggests that it is about trading
YOU1000000123_S0000004	.
YOU1000000123_S0000006	but i think it is a broad course in finance
YOU1000000123_S0000007	so the blurb says financial institutions are a pillar of civilized society
YOU1000000123_S0000008	directing resources across space and time to their best uses so this sounds broader i guess the course is broader
YOU1000000123_S0000009	i wrote the title of the course many years ago when i created this course
YOU1000000123_S0000010	and it has been a title for it
YOU1000000123_S0000012	so what really to me this course is about is how we get things done in our society
YOU1000000123_S0000013	that is how we incentivize people to do things now most of us are in our lives thinking about ourselves
YOU1000000123_S0000014	that is human nature and about our particular .
YOU1000000123_S0000016	place in the life cycle so you may be a young person who is thinking about getting started in life
YOU1000000123_S0000017	but when you join an enterprise or an organization you have to do things for the organization
YOU1000000123_S0000018	and you have to take a different perspective
YOU1000000123_S0000020	you have to help manage a productive venture that involves many people so there are not that many things that you can do as an individual
YOU1000000123_S0000021	that are useful you have to join an organization this is a fundamental principle of human life
YOU1000000123_S0000023	so this is a course about understanding how the institutions work and how we can predict what will happen
YOU1000000123_S0000025	and things are rapidly changing in the information age that we live in now
YOU1000000123_S0000027	so that is what this course is about i do not consider this a vocational course
YOU1000000123_S0000028	because i think it should be of interest to anybody who is interested in how things work
YOU1000000123_S0000030	on the other hand this course .
YOU1000000123_S0000032	comes across as more vocational than most yale courses and at some extent i pride myself on that
YOU1000000123_S0000033	although i consider myself an intellectual but this is a relevant course it is not about how to make money
YOU1000000123_S0000034	you might say it is i suppose but it is about making things work
YOU1000000123_S0000036	these are the topics in this course risk insurance diversification history of finance innovation efficient markets behavioral finance
YOU1000000123_S0000037	actually behavioral finance is a little bit more prominent than you might think from its appearance as number 7 on this list
YOU1000000123_S0000038	behavioral finance is the application of psychology sociology other social sciences to understanding financial events
YOU1000000123_S0000040	it is a revolution in finance that i have watched over the whole course of it because i have organized conferences on behavioral finance
YOU1000000123_S0000041	starting in 1991 working with richard thaler at university of chicago
YOU1000000123_S0000042	we have been doing that for 25 years but we just bequeathed it there are regular seminars of professors
YOU1000000123_S0000043	to nick barberis here at the yale school of management
YOU1000000123_S0000045	but we will talk about it because i kind of believe in a unity of knowledge
YOU1000000123_S0000046	so this course will differ from many other finance courses i want to talk about real people and how things really work
YOU1000000123_S0000048	.
YOU1000000123_S0000050	then we talk about debt the stock market the real estate market regulation 0 by the way regulation is an interest of mine too
YOU1000000123_S0000051	more so than most people who teach finance because i think that the markets need to be regulated
YOU1000000123_S0000052	human beings have a tendency to be manipulative and tricky and finance is used to trick people
YOU1000000123_S0000053	that is why we need regulators so you should not assume that i want to send you off to wall street
YOU1000000123_S0000054	i think that you might go to be a member of the securities and exchange commission or something else as a job
YOU1000000123_S0000055	and be proud of it okay it is important
YOU1000000123_S0000057	and then banking futures futures market that has a special meaning in finance
YOU1000000123_S0000058	monetary policy endowment management investment banking options money managers exchanges public finance
YOU1000000123_S0000059	non profits and finally that last lecture will be on the purpose of all this
YOU1000000123_S0000060	so that is this course
YOU1000000123_S0000062	so i wanted also to just reflect on the relative i said this course looks more vocational
YOU1000000123_S0000063	in a way but i do not consider this vocational school
YOU1000000123_S0000065	i would like to say useful
YOU1000000123_S0000067	one thought perspective i wanted to give you was how important is finance anyway unless you go into academia
YOU1000000123_S0000068	you will get a job somewhere in the real world so where are the jobs
YOU1000000123_S0000069	well i looked up on the bureau of labor statistics it was a publication of the us government on their website
YOU1000000123_S0000070	they have data on just how many people are in different professions in the united states
YOU1000000123_S0000071	and they also have a forecast so what i am showing the latest data is for the year 2014
YOU1000000123_S0000072	and it has the number of people in 1000s and then also on there we have the projection for 2024
YOU1000000123_S0000073	so you note that at the top i have got finance these are specific finance professions not all finance professions
YOU1000000123_S0000074	financial analysts financial managers personal financial advisors
YOU1000000123_S0000075	they all have 100s of 1000s of people but i wanted you to note what about the other majors that you have here i am not diminishing them
YOU1000000123_S0000076	but economics economists not so many
YOU1000000123_S0000078	but you might also be interested in astronomy i actually love astronomy when i was a kid i thought i would be an astronomer
YOU1000000123_S0000079	but i had to reach reality there is lots of exciting fields
YOU1000000123_S0000080	where there are almost no jobs so there is how many astronomers are there
YOU1000000123_S0000082	sociologists political scientists or mathematicians this is not to diminish your majoring in those fields
YOU1000000123_S0000083	but you just do not expect to get a job in those fields
YOU1000000123_S0000084	i also put down at the bottom massage therapist i did not know that was a profession
YOU1000000123_S0000085	but there is projected to be about 20 massage therapists in the united states in 2024
YOU1000000123_S0000086	so we do not have a massage therapy major here
YOU1000000123_S0000087	but that is a sign of
YOU1000000123_S0000089	how the market makes things important
YOU1000000123_S0000090	now rana farahar might be right about this there is something wrong with having so many finance people maybe we need more massage therapists
YOU1000000123_S0000091	finance people
YOU1000000123_S0000092	but there is a sense of reality that i think that .
YOU1000000123_S0000093	part of the reason that there is so many of them is that they deal with important issues that can not be quickly
YOU1000000123_S0000094	it can not be more easily solved we need all these people that is why i take some pride in this course in being connected to the real world
YOU1000000123_S0000095	there are real job opportunities in finance and there are also i think in the new industrial revolution period
YOU1000000123_S0000096	they will still be i think this is one of the fields that is not going to be
YOU1000000123_S0000098	totally replaced by a computer the problem with finance is that there is a high inequality in this field
YOU1000000123_S0000099	some people make a lot of money on the other hand you have to give it away this is another thing about this course
YOU1000000123_S0000100	if you make a lot of money in finance it is a game you enjoyed it now give most of it away that is going to be a theme
YOU1000000124_S0000000	so i am on a long and circuitous route and i will only arrive at that again at the end
YOU1000000124_S0000002	so there has been a battle going on for a long time about the nature of artificial intelligence and what its nature should be
YOU1000000124_S0000003	there is 2 very different approaches they are very different ideologies one is inspired by logic
YOU1000000124_S0000004	and so the idea is that the essence of intelligence is using symbolic rules to manipulate symbolic expressions
YOU1000000124_S0000005	and the people who believed this or the people who believed it did not think this was empirical they thought that is the only way you could have intelligence they thought it was a sort of necessary truth that that is what intelligence was going to be
YOU1000000124_S0000007	there is a different set of people who are equally ideological who believed that if you want to make an intelligent system you should look to biology
YOU1000000124_S0000008	and in particular shoot try and understand how the brain was doing it
YOU1000000124_S0000010	and it does not look as if the brains of animals are doing it by logic of course there is all sorts of debates about whether animals are intelligent but .
YOU1000000124_S0000012	the biologically inspired people thought that the essence of intelligence was learning the connection strengths of the neural network
YOU1000000124_S0000013	and you can see these are 2 completely different world views they kind of miss each other
YOU1000000124_S0000015	so there is a battle that went on for a long time in the 1960s we had very simple neural nets and we had a simple learning algorithm for them
YOU1000000124_S0000017	they only have one layer of features and they were completely wiped out by simulacra
YOU1000000124_S0000019	so when i started in graduate school in the 1970s it was well known that neural networks were nonsense they were the past they would never do anything and it had been proved that they were useless
YOU1000000124_S0000021	that is what i was told and that is what almost everybody now believes
YOU1000000124_S0000023	then in the 1980s .
YOU1000000124_S0000025	various groups came up with the back propagation procedure and that allowed neural networks to learn multiple layers of features
YOU1000000124_S0000027	so we got over this problem that until then neural networks just had hand designed features they waited those features to make a decision and then they made a decision
YOU1000000124_S0000028	they did not learn their own features with backpropagation we could learn lesser features and there is a lot of hype about how this was going to solve everything and that is what i believed
YOU1000000124_S0000029	that is i believed in the 80s that what is happening today was going to happen then and it did not
YOU1000000124_S0000031	in the 1990s
YOU1000000124_S0000033	people showed there were other machine learning algorithms that worked better than backpropagation on modest sized problems things called support vector machines
YOU1000000124_S0000034	they had fancier math and they worked a little bit better on what we now think of as very small problems things with a few 1000 training examples
YOU1000000124_S0000036	so your lab will wipe that again
YOU1000000124_S0000038	then in about 2006 we came up with some technical improvements to neural networks that made them a bit easier to learn
YOU1000000124_S0000039	and that was not the main point at that time we got more computation and more data and suddenly neural networks with lots of layers of features worked amazingly well
YOU1000000124_S0000040	and now google and facebook and microsoft and apple and amazon and all the other high tech companies you can think of nvidia for one are all betting the farm on neural networks
YOU1000000124_S0000041	they believe that is suddenly to be the future and there is a huge demand for students who know anything about neural networks
YOU1000000124_S0000043	so the old way to make a computer do what you wanted was to write a program
YOU1000000124_S0000044	where you figured out how you would do it yourself and then you explain to the computer in exquisite detail how to do what you would have done yourself but a whole lot faster
YOU1000000124_S0000046	so if i wanted to sort a list for example i would figure out well i am not a computer scientist which we will quickly realize
YOU1000000124_S0000047	i would figure out well i could go down the list and find the biggest thing and then put that at the top and then i could go down the list again and find the next biggest thing and put that underneath those things
YOU1000000124_S0000048	it is not a good algorithm but i might decide to do it like that and then i could tell the computer to do that and then the computer would sort of list faster than i could
YOU1000000124_S0000050	the new way to do it is to you 1st tell the computer to pretend to be a neural network
YOU1000000124_S0000052	and then you just show it examples so you have shown an example of an unsorted list and a sorted list and you show lots of examples and you say i want you to take these things and produce those things
YOU1000000124_S0000053	and after a while he gets the idea that is you do not have to write the program
YOU1000000124_S0000055	sorting lists is something that is difficult to do this way recognizing objects and images is something that is much easier to do this way
YOU1000000124_S0000057	so here is an example of something we would like computers to do and people in classical ai tried to do this for 50 years and they did not make much progress
YOU1000000124_S0000058	so the idea is you are given the rgb values of a whole bunch of pixels and you have to convert those to a caption that describes what is in the image
YOU1000000124_S0000059	so you get all these numbers coming in and you have to have a string of words coming out
YOU1000000124_S0000061	and you can imagine how you might go about writing a program to do that but you can imagine it is going to be difficult
YOU1000000124_S0000062	you 1st of all would maybe write a program to find little pieces of edge in the image or maybe color contrast
YOU1000000124_S0000063	and just doing revision would be more than you could do
YOU1000000124_S0000065	and then relating this vision to the language would be complicated now what we can do is we can solve that problem just by using machine learning
YOU1000000124_S0000067	with hardly any hand problems
YOU1000000124_S0000069	and by the end of the lecture you will understand how we do that
YOU1000000124_S0000071	okay is that louder good okay i think the mic was turned off
YOU1000000124_S0000073	so i am going to explain many of you know this already but i am going to explain what large measuring neuron is it is a little computational device
YOU1000000124_S0000074	it is a little bit like a real neuron but not very it takes some inputs coming typically from other neurons it has weights on the connections
YOU1000000124_S0000075	he takes the inputs times the weights adds it up that is his total input and then he puts it through a nonlinear function
YOU1000000124_S0000076	that nonlinear function on the right there is what we mostly use now and that is its output
YOU1000000124_S0000077	so basically that nonlinear function simply says if you have got a lot of input give a lot of output and if your input is below the threshold do not give any output
YOU1000000124_S0000078	so it is called a rectified leading edge
YOU1000000124_S0000080	and the question is if you hook together a bunch of those guys and you figure out a way to make those weights on the connections adapt what can you do with it
YOU1000000124_S0000082	so we typically hook them together by making multiple layers this again is sort of neurally inspired and if you look at a multi layer neural network like that
YOU1000000124_S0000084	the layers in the middle it is hard to figure out what the weights should be when you adapt those weights in effect you are deciding what features
YOU1000000124_S0000085	the neurons in the middle edge should detect so the problem of adapting those weights is the problem of deciding what intermediate features do you want they are the same problem
YOU1000000124_S0000087	now i am going to show you a way of learning those features that is really stupid
YOU1000000124_S0000088	but we will definitely work we are going to give it inputs and we are going to tell it what the right answer is
YOU1000000124_S0000089	and then we are going to adapt the weights one at a time
YOU1000000124_S0000091	so suppose we want something that will tell the difference between pictures of cats and pictures of dogs we give it 2 out that is one for cat and one for dog
YOU1000000124_S0000092	and if you show a cat and the apple for dog is higher than the apple for cat that is bad so we can show a bunch of pictures and measure how well it is doing
YOU1000000124_S0000094	and then we can pick one of the weights in the network and we can change the value of that weight
YOU1000000124_S0000096	and we can see if the network is doing better or worse than it was before to see that you need to show a bunch of examples
YOU1000000124_S0000097	if the change worked we keep it and then we do it again but another way
YOU1000000124_S0000099	now i think you can see that that algorithm is going to have to show a bunch of examples for each weight and if you have got a 10 weights it is going to be extremely slow
YOU1000000124_S0000101	but that is what we want to do we want to change weights in the direction that makes them help that is all we are trying to do we are just trying to do that efficiently
YOU1000000124_S0000102	and back propagation which many of you know but i am not going to explain that
YOU1000000124_S0000103	it is just an efficient way of computing how to change the weights in the direction that will help reduce the discrepancy between what the network outputs and what you would like it to output
YOU1000000124_S0000105	and the big difference is that if you perturb the weights you measure the effects of a change of weight on the output
YOU1000000124_S0000106	and with backpropagation you compute the effects so if you know all the weights in the network you do not have to measure you compute
YOU1000000124_S0000107	and when you compute you can compute for all the weights at the same time what direction you should change them to have
YOU1000000124_S0000108	you can not do that when you are measuring you have to change the one at a time
YOU1000000124_S0000110	so computing is much more efficient than measuring evolution can not do the same measuring can not do the same computing in evolution you change a gene
YOU1000000124_S0000111	and then there is a whole developmental process in the environment and you do not know all that so you can not back up again
YOU1000000124_S0000113	so what evolution did was it came up with a brain so that it could use that cognition that is my theory
YOU1000000124_S0000114	so in backpropagation you go forwards through these layers you compare with the correct answer you backpropagate signals that allows you to compute for each weight what direction to change it in to make it work better
YOU1000000124_S0000116	and we thought in the 80s that was problem solved we had come out and done lots of those and it did not work very well
YOU1000000124_S0000118	and we did not know why it did not work most people thought it did not work because this is a stupid idea that is the idea that you would take a network with random weights
YOU1000000124_S0000119	and you just show the world data as a result of seeing this data it will be able to design all its own feature detectors
YOU1000000124_S0000120	and do very good performance of things like machine translation or recognizing objects in images or recognizing speech
YOU1000000124_S0000122	almost everybody in ai thought that idea was completely crazy a few of us did not a few of us just thought we do not know why it is not working
YOU1000000124_S0000123	it is obviously the right thing to do and we discovered later the reason it was not working was because computers were too slow and data sets were not big enough
YOU1000000124_S0000124	if you would said that in the 80s people would have said 0 yeah sure if you had a bigger computer and more data it would work but look it does not work it turned out i was right
YOU1000000124_S0000125	and when we got a bigger computer and more data it worked now there were some technical things too but it was mainly the increasing computer speed and data size that mattered
YOU1000000124_S0000128	so i am going to show you a couple of examples before i get back to the issue of water fortress
YOU1000000124_S0000130	the example that probably had the most impact was in 2012 there was a big public competition where you have a 1000 different types of objects and a 10 training images
YOU1000000124_S0000131	and you have to learn to recognize the different types of objects and there is a secret test set so you can not tune on the test set
YOU1000000124_S0000132	and it is counted as right if you get the correct class in your top 5 bets because it is not clear what the right bet is for some of them
YOU1000000124_S0000133	for example we have an image which has a dalmatian in a bowl of cherries same dalmatian same cherries one of those is right and if you say both you are going to get it right
YOU1000000124_S0000136	so a lot of the best existing computer vision methods were used and the results look like this
YOU1000000124_S0000138	the results at the top are where we are now the results below .
YOU1000000124_S0000140	2 of my graduate students in the university of toronto managed to get 16% error
YOU1000000124_S0000141	and then the best computer vision groups were getting more than 25%
YOU1000000124_S0000142	so we almost halved the error rate and that had a huge impact on computer vision almost every night that is within a year
YOU1000000124_S0000143	all the living people changed from doing hand tuned things doing what they were doing before to doing neural nets
YOU1000000124_S0000144	and so in 2011 if you sent a paper using neural nets to a computer vision conference it would be rejected because it was using neural nets
YOU1000000124_S0000145	and by 2015 if you sent a paper to a computer vision conference it would be rejected if it was not using the internet it was really a big change
YOU1000000124_S0000147	ok it was obvious if 2 grad students can beat the best computer vision researchers who have been doing this stuff for 30 years then you are going to develop a lot further
YOU1000000124_S0000148	and things did by 2015 the error rate on injured error stood at 5% which is about the human error rate and now stands at 3% it is incredibly good
YOU1000000124_S0000150	so i will just show you some examples of that kind of object recognition
YOU1000000124_S0000152	so there is an image and the right answer is cheetah and if you look at what the neural net says it is very confident that cheetah is the right answer
YOU1000000124_S0000153	and it has a few other things that things are not totally out of the question like leopard and snow leopard and egyptian cat so all its backup answers are very sensible answers
YOU1000000124_S0000154	and notice that is not a sort of typical image of a cheetah half the head is missing and it is a cheetah close up right
YOU1000000124_S0000155	it is not a sort of classic it is not the diagram of the make of a cheetah just to show somebody what a cheetah is
YOU1000000124_S0000157	here is a bullet train and you will notice the bullet train probably occupies less than 10% of the pixels the building in the background is much bigger
YOU1000000124_S0000158	there is a platform there is a personal platform but it sort of knows what the right answer is likely to be because it is understood about the focus of images
YOU1000000124_S0000159	you put the thing you want to attend to in the middle and all its alternative answers are quite reasonable
YOU1000000124_S0000161	here is what margaret said wrongly
YOU1000000124_S0000163	so the correct answer is hand glass
YOU1000000124_S0000165	it thinks the best answer is scissors and you can sort of see why i am not thinking scissors you can see better why i am not thinking frying pan
YOU1000000124_S0000166	it does not understand that that thing that i think must be a chain is not the handle of a frame basically it needs glasses
YOU1000000124_S0000167	you can see why it says stethoscope the important thing here is that all the wrong answers are visually plausible wrong answers
YOU1000000124_S0000168	to give you an idea that understands a lot about what things look like
YOU1000000124_S0000170	okay so that issue should back to computer vision and then a few years later
YOU1000000124_S0000171	some very great people including enya satsukawa who was one of the people who did the 2012 imagenet system
YOU1000000124_S0000173	decided they would try neural nets on machine translation and machine translation ought to be the perfect problem for symbolic ai
YOU1000000124_S0000174	so people in symbolic ar i mean we all agree that symbols come in and symbols come out okay
YOU1000000124_S0000175	the question is what is in between is it just more symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000176	so the classic ai view is symbols come in what is inside is sort of like symbols it is sort of cleaned up symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000177	it is symbolic expressions and you do manipulations on symbolic expressions and then another symbol string comes out so it is called symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000179	the biological view would be symbols come in they are the way we code things to go over a communication channel
YOU1000000124_S0000180	they resist noise nicely once the symbols have come in they get converted into things that are nothing like those symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000182	so the point about a symbol is it only has basically one property a symbol either is or is not identical to another symbol
YOU1000000124_S0000184	if you take 2 different symbols the only problem that matters is are they the same symbol
YOU1000000124_S0000186	ok all the other properties are just .
YOU1000000124_S0000188	well it is a property of the symbol that are not relevant to the process
YOU1000000124_S0000190	in neural nets what happens is a symbol comes in and it gets converted into a great big vector that has all sorts of features
YOU1000000124_S0000191	that capture lots of knowledge about the meaning of that word
YOU1000000124_S0000193	and words that mean similar things but do not look similar like friday and wednesday
YOU1000000124_S0000195	they mean pretty similar things they are distinct symbols
YOU1000000124_S0000197	there is nothing well there is the morpheming structure of dane so that is a bad example but basically
YOU1000000124_S0000199	they are distinct symbols and that is all a symbol processing system learns in a neural net it learns that wednesday and friday are very very similar things and we will see that later
YOU1000000124_S0000201	so the symbolic ai critical machine translation is to say ok a simple string comes in in english
YOU1000000124_S0000202	we are going to do some manipulations using rules and we are clearly going to use rules of grammar we are also going to use semantic rules that somehow do compositional semantics
YOU1000000124_S0000203	that is given what the individual pieces mean they figure out what a group of pieces must mean and then we are going to produce symbols coming in
YOU1000000124_S0000205	and we are going to use all the knowledge that linguists have about how language works
YOU1000000124_S0000207	the neural network approach now even i thought this was a bit crazy a bit ambitious
YOU1000000124_S0000208	is to say let us just take a whole bunch of translations pairs of an english sentence and a french sentence
YOU1000000124_S0000210	and we will stick in the english sentence one word at a time and then we will go into a recurrent neural network which i will explain in a minute where things cycle around inside
YOU1000000124_S0000212	and after we finish sticking the english sentence that recurrent neural network will have some particular state of activity and we will call that a thought vector
YOU1000000124_S0000214	that is what a thought is it is the state of activity of the neural net after it is read the english sentence
YOU1000000124_S0000216	and you will notice if you think about how the word thought works in english i can say
YOU1000000125_S0000000	well i will tell you a couple of strange things that things that i do not really understand the 1st is when we have done the analysis of the effects of the future authoring program
YOU1000000125_S0000001	it has had a differential impact on men
YOU1000000125_S0000002	and it is had a particularly differential impact on what i would call excluded men
YOU1000000125_S0000003	so that would be non western ethnic minority men or or what
YOU1000000125_S0000004	majority men who are not doing very well so for example at mohawk college
YOU1000000125_S0000005	the future authoring program had a particularly robust effect on mohawk college students who were men who had not done very well in high school and who had not picked a major
YOU1000000125_S0000006	that had a career destination at its end
YOU1000000125_S0000007	so you can imagine those people are they have an ambiguous relationship with the idea of education
YOU1000000125_S0000008	and they are not oriented specifically towards a goal they are not very motivated
YOU1000000125_S0000010	now why did it have a differential effect on men that is a good question
YOU1000000125_S0000012	well 1st of all the women are doing better
YOU1000000125_S0000013	so it might just be a matter of the fact that it does better for people who are not doing as well and at the moment most of them are men
YOU1000000125_S0000014	i do not believe i think that might be part of it but i do not believe that is all of it
YOU1000000125_S0000015	i think that part of the reason that women are doing better is because they are agreeable and so if a system sets out a structure and says here is a pathway to attainment
YOU1000000125_S0000016	the women will not rebel against that they will go along with it and that is working very well for them at the moment
YOU1000000125_S0000017	the men especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution and there is way more men on the disagreeable end of the distribution than there are women
YOU1000000125_S0000018	right that is what you get from if you look at overlapping normal distributions so there is the male distribution female distribution for agreeableness
YOU1000000125_S0000019	male distribution for agreeableness tremendous overlap
YOU1000000125_S0000021	okay women are higher all the really agreeable people are women all the really disagreeable people are men and maybe the real differences occur at the extremes right so .
YOU1000000125_S0000022	so and it is a very interesting side effect of overlapping distributions so people can be mostly the same but that can still produce radical differences
YOU1000000125_S0000024	disagreeable men will not do anything they do not want to do
YOU1000000125_S0000026	they just say up yours i will go home and play video games i am not listening to your stupid classes and why should i work for you i will just go have fun
YOU1000000125_S0000027	i will do my own thing i do not think they are motivated and so then if you take the men who are like that and you say okay what do you want
YOU1000000125_S0000029	you can have what you want but you have to figure out what it is so then they write down what they want and they think 0 hey well that might be worth having so maybe i will put some effort into it
YOU1000000125_S0000030	that is what it looks like to me now you know that is weak evidence and this is a weak argument but i am trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this but i will tell you something else that is really weird
YOU1000000125_S0000031	i do not understand this either
YOU1000000125_S0000033	more than 90% of the people who watch my videos on youtube are men now that is weird because about 80% of psychology students are women
YOU1000000125_S0000034	so that is not what you would expect right you would expect that the majority of them would be women and you might say well it is because of the political stance i have taken
YOU1000000125_S0000035	and i thought well that is possible so i went and looked at the demographic data because i have that well before i did any of the political videos 85% of my viewers were men
YOU1000000125_S0000036	so it is actually increased a bit it is increased by 6% and that is not trivial but it was still overwhelmingly men
YOU1000000125_S0000037	so that was interesting i thought what the hell why is that exactly and then now i have been watching crowds when i have been talking to them and the crowds that have come to see me in person
YOU1000000125_S0000038	this happened at the university of toronto free speech debate and i actually noticed it and commented on it before the debate took place because i was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women
YOU1000000125_S0000039	and i looked around the room and i thought hey 80% of the people in this room are men so i had all the men stand up women stand up and then all the men stand up i said look like
YOU1000000125_S0000040	here is a natural experiment for some reason 80% of the people who showed up to this are men now everybody thought i was kind of cracked to do that
YOU1000000125_S0000041	and it was a risk you know but i thought no there is something going on here and then what is interesting now is that every public appearance that i have made
YOU1000000125_S0000042	that is related to the sort of topics that we are discussing is overwhelmingly men it is like 85 to 90%
YOU1000000125_S0000043	and so i thought wow that is weird like what the hell is going on here exactly and then the other thing i have noticed is that
YOU1000000125_S0000044	i have been talking a lot to the crowds that i have been talking to not about rights but about responsibility right
YOU1000000125_S0000045	because you can not have the bloody conversation what are you doing you can not have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because
YOU1000000125_S0000046	your rights are my responsibility that is what they are technically so you just can not have only half of that discussion
YOU1000000125_S0000047	and we are only having half that discussion and the question is well what the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion
YOU1000000125_S0000048	and the answer is well you are leaving out responsibility and then the question is well what are you leaving out if you are leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well maybe you are leaving out the meaning of life
YOU1000000125_S0000050	that is what it looks like to me it is like here you are suffering away what makes it worthwhile rights
YOU1000000125_S0000051	you know you are completely out you are completely you have no idea what you are you it is almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is
YOU1000000125_S0000053	responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000055	that is what gives life meaning it is like lift a load then you can tolerate yourself right because look at you you are useless easily hurt
YOU1000000125_S0000056	easily killed why should you have any self respect that is the story of the fall pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think
YOU1000000125_S0000057	yeah well useless as i am at least i could move that from there to there well what is really cool about that is that when i talk to these crowds about this
YOU1000000125_S0000058	the men is eyes light up and that is very like i have seen that phenomenon because i have been talking about this mythological material for a long time and i can see when i am watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift
YOU1000000125_S0000059	their eyes light up because i put something together for them that is what mythological stories do so i am not taking responsibility for that that is what the stories do
YOU1000000125_S0000060	so i say this story and people go click click click you know and their eyes light up but this responsibility thing that is a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that
YOU1000000125_S0000061	it is unbelievable and one of the things i have been talking to some of the people who have been running for the conservative leadership in canada and i have been talking to them about
YOU1000000125_S0000062	well the difficulties they have communicating with young people because conservatives what the hell are they going to sell to young people right because being conservative is something that happens when you are older they can sell responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000064	no one is selling it and the thing is for man there is nothing but responsibility you know i was watching the simpsons the other day i watched the 1st simpsons episode
YOU1000000125_S0000065	and i deconstructed it
YOU1000000125_S0000067	and so it is really interesting so what happens in the 1st simpson episode is that it is christmas and homer and marge are going to buy some christmas presents but homer does not get his christmas bonus
YOU1000000125_S0000068	and so he is absolutely crushed by that and that actually is a recurring theme in the simpsons where homer loses his job or something like that or can not make enough money
YOU1000000125_S0000069	he is completely crushed even though he is kind of useless bumbling laughing fool of a guy you know
YOU1000000125_S0000070	the thing that gives that show its soul is that he is still oriented towards his family that is what makes him honorable is that foolish as he is
YOU1000000125_S0000071	he is decided to adopt responsibility for his family and to try to bear that and so he is not he is a holy fool he is not a complete fool
YOU1000000125_S0000072	and it is so interesting watching the story because he suffers dreadfully as a consequence of not being able to fulfill his responsibility well that is for men
YOU1000000125_S0000073	women have their sets of responsibilities they are not the same right because they are complicated because women of course have to take primary responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000074	for having infants at least but then also for caring for them they are structured differently than men
YOU1000000125_S0000076	for biological necessity even if it is not a psychological issue and it is also partly a psychological issue women know what they have to do men have to figure out what they have to do
YOU1000000125_S0000077	and if they have nothing worth living for then they stay peter pan
YOU1000000125_S0000079	and why the hell not
YOU1000000125_S0000081	because the alternative to valued responsibility is
YOU1000000125_S0000083	impulsive low class pleasure and you saw that in the pinocchio story right that is pleasure island it is like well why lift a load if there is nothing in it for you
YOU1000000125_S0000085	that is another thing that we are doing to men that is a very bad idea and to boys
YOU1000000125_S0000087	you are pathological and oppressive it is like fine then why the hell am i going to play if that is the situation if i get no credit for bearing responsibility
YOU1000000125_S0000088	could bloody well be sure i am not going to bear any but then you know your life is useless and meaningless and you are full of self contempt and nihilism and .
YOU1000000125_S0000089	and that is not good and so that is what i think is going on at a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction
YOU1000000125_S0000090	a man has to decide that he is going to do something he has to decide that
YOU1000000125_S0000091	yeah well you know partly what you are trying to do in the future authoring process is say okay well what is your highest value right it is the star it is like okay what are you aiming for
YOU1000000125_S0000092	you can decide man but you know there is some criteria it should be good for you it should be good for you in a way that facilitates your moving forward
YOU1000000125_S0000093	maybe it should be good for you in a way that is also good for the family and the community it should cover the domain of life
YOU1000000125_S0000094	i mean there is constraints on what you should regard as a value but within those constraints you have the .
YOU1000000125_S0000096	choice you have choice well the thing is is that people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the goddamn load
YOU1000000125_S0000098	so and they think well i will not carry any load it is like okay fine but then you are like the sled dog that does not have a sled to pull you are just going to .
YOU1000000125_S0000099	you are going to tear pieces out of your own legs because you are bored you know you need people are pack animals they need to pull against a weight
YOU1000000125_S0000100	and that is not true for everyone it is not true particularly say for low conscientious people i mean maybe they are open and creative or extroverted and some other things
YOU1000000125_S0000101	but for the typical person
YOU1000000125_S0000103	they will eat themselves up unless they have a load this is why there is such an opiate epidemic among dispossessed white middle aged guys
YOU1000000125_S0000104	who are unemployed in the us it is like they lose their job they are done
YOU1000000125_S0000106	right they despise themselves they develop chronic pain syndromes and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiates it is like that is what we are doing so .
YOU1000000125_S0000107	yeah that is what it looks like to me is you you have to and it is so interesting to watch the young men when you talk to them about responsibility there is a goddamn thrilled about it
YOU1000000125_S0000108	it just blows me away it is like really
YOU1000000125_S0000110	that is the counterculture
YOU1000000125_S0000112	grow the hell up and do something useful really i could do that 0 i am so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before
YOU1000000125_S0000113	it is like rights rights rights rights jesus it is appalling and i feel that that is deeply felt by the people
YOU1000000125_S0000114	who are coming out to listen to these sorts of things too they have had enough of that
YOU1000000125_S0000116	so and they better have because it is a non productive mode of being responsibility man that is where the meaning in life is so .
YOU1000000126_S0000000	now it is my privilege to introduce andrew ng co founder and chairman of the board of coursera
YOU1000000126_S0000001	he is an adjunct professor in the computer science department at stanford university
YOU1000000126_S0000002	and as i think everybody knows in 2011 he led the development of stanford is massive open online course platform a mooc
YOU1000000126_S0000003	and taught an online machine learning class that was offered to over 10 students that was the initiative that led to the co founding of coursera
YOU1000000126_S0000004	he was also the founding lead of the google brain team which helped google become a leading ai company as well as the former chief scientist at beidou
YOU1000000126_S0000006	where he led the company is ai strategy and execution he is authored or co authored 200 research papers in machine learning robotics and related fields
YOU1000000126_S0000007	in 2013 he was named to the time 100 list of most influential people he holds degrees from carnegie mellon university of
YOU1000000126_S0000008	carnegie mellon university sorry folks mit and the university of california berkeley
YOU1000000126_S0000009	and perhaps what is the most interesting to me personally about andrew is that he teaches 11 coursera courses
YOU1000000126_S0000010	and he has taught over 340 learners that is a lot of people
YOU1000000126_S0000011	welcome andrew
YOU1000000126_S0000013	thanks a lot betty and thanks everyone for joining us and for sticking with us through the end of this conference
YOU1000000126_S0000014	i was browsing through the attendees names and regretful that we can not be hanging out in person together
YOU1000000126_S0000015	but of all the i have attended every coursera pond this conference since the 1st one and this is the largest one we have ever held so that is a silver lining
YOU1000000126_S0000016	that let me share my slides
YOU1000000126_S0000018	so hopefully you can see this
YOU1000000126_S0000020	
YOU1000000126_S0000022	listening to all of the presentations from earlier today i feel that
YOU1000000126_S0000024	because of the rise of covid
YOU1000000126_S0000026	there is not a fork in the road for higher education
YOU1000000126_S0000028	society is trying out to us to help and we as a community have the capability to help a lot of people maybe not everyone but a lot of people
YOU1000000126_S0000030	and the choices we make in this community in higher education community the choices we make over the next year will stay with us for decades to come
YOU1000000126_S0000032	the online education movement has been building for a decade or maybe many decades
YOU1000000126_S0000033	some of you know about the starting of coursera where we had started with 2 courses out of stanford the machine learning classes i taught and the databases class
YOU1000000126_S0000034	taught by my friend jennifer widom
YOU1000000126_S0000035	and in the not quite decades since then the number of causes has grown from 2 to over 4000 on coursera and an even larger number worldwide
YOU1000000126_S0000037	so this has been growing for a long time and all of you our community has been learning and figuring out how to teach online
YOU1000000126_S0000039	
YOU1000000126_S0000041	and covid is accelerating everything
YOU1000000126_S0000043	we are seeing how many workers are hit by covid especially the ones without a degree
YOU1000000126_S0000045	we have seen how more people are taking online courses to help deal with self isolation and also learn about public health
YOU1000000126_S0000047	covid is also creating unique challenges to our institutions washington post new york times reported college students rebelling against full tuition after classes move online
YOU1000000126_S0000048	i was gratified when i heard matthew in the panel just now talk about announcing lower pricing for this summer session
YOU1000000126_S0000049	so many of the trends that have been underway are accelerated by covid and we all know that society is hurting
YOU1000000126_S0000050	the imf estimates that the world will experience the worst recession since the great depression
YOU1000000126_S0000051	most of us many of us that live through the global financial crisis of 2009 where the global economy shrunk by 0 one 
YOU1000000126_S0000052	this time around it will shrink much more by imf estimates and just in the us alone 220 unemployed in a matter of weeks
YOU1000000126_S0000053	and people people are hurting
YOU1000000126_S0000055	we have a big role to play to help many of these people
YOU1000000126_S0000057	done
YOU1000000126_S0000059	compounding trend on trend trust in expertise and trust in institutions has also been going down not just for the past few months but for many years now
YOU1000000126_S0000060	edelman carries out a large annual very large multi city survey called the edelman trust barometer
YOU1000000126_S0000061	and in one of the recent studies they plot
YOU1000000126_S0000064	different institutions according to how competent they are viewed and how ethical they are viewed
YOU1000000126_S0000065	so the horizontal axis is how competent is an institution vertical axis is how ethical is an institution
YOU1000000126_S0000066	and businesses are viewed as quite competent but not always the most ethical on average
YOU1000000126_S0000067	ngos non government organizations a view that is relatively ethical but not as competent
YOU1000000126_S0000068	and government media are perceived by citizens all around the world as neither necessarily competent nor ethical
YOU1000000126_S0000069	i am not saying that any of these perceptions are fair i think there are plenty of highly competent and highly ethical individuals in all of these institutions
YOU1000000126_S0000070	but there is a perception of a large swath of society and we have a lack of institutions that are broadly perceived
YOU1000000126_S0000071	fairly or unfairly but lack of institutions that are broadly perceived as both highly competent and highly ethical
YOU1000000126_S0000072	i would quite like for our institutions of education our institutions of higher education to be able to play that role
YOU1000000126_S0000073	this trust parameter did not have a note specifically on higher education but we have all seen the trends as educators for many years now
YOU1000000126_S0000075	and so maybe it is no surprise therefore that with the rise of covid with all of these impacts higher education is in crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000076	you have seen just in the last few recent period of time articles with titles like crisis in higher education or in my home state of california california is higher education crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000077	or president of higher american higher education and so on on and on and on we are seeing articles like these
YOU1000000126_S0000078	0 and did i say that this was created by the covid crisis actually these articles that were published are well before the covid crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000079	so it is strange and interesting that the field of higher education has been in crisis for about a decade now
YOU1000000126_S0000080	i think covid is accelerating this crisis but if we were already in this state even before the recent pandemic
YOU1000000126_S0000081	i think this is even more true now you know there is i am proud to be an educator excited about the discipline very committed to education
YOU1000000126_S0000082	but i would quite like to do something so that maybe by the year 2025 maybe we can all work really hard for a few years and not be in crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000083	or any more a few years from now it does seem like the healthiest day for our industry to be able to happen in crisis for so long
YOU1000000126_S0000084	but to me i think this popular reflection of of the state of crisis is is maybe a sign that
YOU1000000126_S0000085	despite all the very positive contributions that we have and we are striving to make there is a potential for us to do even better
YOU1000000126_S0000087	one of the documents that moved me the most is the universal declaration of human rights
YOU1000000126_S0000088	i 1st read this document when i was a young assistant professor at stanford and it really moved me the 1st time i read this
YOU1000000126_S0000089	but quoting from article 26 it says we as a society declared in 1948
YOU1000000126_S0000090	that was the year my father was born 72 years ago
YOU1000000126_S0000091	where society decided that everyone has the right to education
YOU1000000126_S0000092	education should be free at this elementary and fundamental stages tech and professional education should be available
YOU1000000126_S0000093	and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit
YOU1000000126_S0000094	sadly despite this proud declaration this beautiful declaration that we made as a society 72 years ago
YOU1000000126_S0000095	this still is not the reality we live in today
YOU1000000126_S0000096	education is limited by geography social and economic limitations and political restrictions
YOU1000000126_S0000097	these restrictions have already been making it hard for students to get an education and it is become even harder just in the past few weeks
YOU1000000126_S0000098	just last night the united states president tweeted out about suspending immigration to the united states
YOU1000000126_S0000099	and i have no idea how this will affect many of our students that have been or are counting on maybe coming to the united states
YOU1000000126_S0000100	for their studies
YOU1000000126_S0000101	and even simone outside the united states simone from imperial on the panel mentioned just now people are finally on board to get to london
YOU1000000126_S0000102	this is true not just in the united states and in the uk but all around the world and covid is accelerating travel restrictions like crazy
YOU1000000126_S0000103	i think it is up to all of us to use the digital realm to make sure that education becomes more rather than less accessible
YOU1000000126_S0000105	now amidst all of this doom and gloom amidst all of these challenges we face there is a massive silver lining
YOU1000000126_S0000106	i think silver lining is that this growing acceptance of the virtual world of online education
YOU1000000126_S0000107	and we are also really lucky that we work in an industry sector that in education a lot of our work can move online
YOU1000000126_S0000108	not all of it not easily but a lot of our work can move online
YOU1000000126_S0000109	so as an educator i feel a special responsibility for us to lead this change and to play the role that all of us
YOU1000000126_S0000111	that all of you can play to help the rest of society
YOU1000000126_S0000113	and part of the silver lining is that even with everything going on around the world
YOU1000000126_S0000114	i see that people want to feel empowered despite the unemployment despite the uncertainty around the world
YOU1000000126_S0000115	people wake up in the morning wanting to have productive quarantine mornings and afternoons and evenings
YOU1000000126_S0000117	jeff showed this picture of a rapid rise in new user enrollments and this is not a short term trend that will be over when covid dies down
YOU1000000126_S0000118	this growth in online education has been a long term trend but only accelerated by covid
YOU1000000126_S0000119	and you know what with these 10s of learners all around the world learning new habits they are teaching themselves how to learn online
YOU1000000126_S0000120	i feel like as an instructor i have been teaching my stanford classes online via zoom
YOU1000000126_S0000121	and just as i had to learn new skills our students our learners are having to learn new skills to succeed in learning online
YOU1000000126_S0000122	and hopefully more countries will emerge from lockdown soon but even when we all reopen our campuses
YOU1000000126_S0000123	when social distancing can be relaxed
YOU1000000126_S0000124	the skills that these 10s or 10s of 10s 100s of 10s of online learners are learning right now they will not forget these skills
YOU1000000126_S0000125	and this creates an opportunity for us to keep on using the digital medium to keep on serving them even after covid is over
YOU1000000126_S0000127	i like this quote by one of the partners at ideo who said that the virus seems like an accelerator for digital change that was already underway
YOU1000000126_S0000128	and that this digital mindset will persist and it is highly unlikely that companies or universities or students will try to return to what worked prior to the pandemic
YOU1000000126_S0000129	patrick brothers during the panel also said that what might happen what we previously thought might happen over the next 10 years
YOU1000000126_S0000130	will now maybe happen over the next 2 years
YOU1000000126_S0000131	and with all this change i feel like digital pedagogy is still in its infancy
YOU1000000126_S0000132	i have been teaching online for a long time running little experiments many of which went nowhere
YOU1000000126_S0000133	even today i feel that online pedagogy the way we teach online interactive learners is still in its infancy
YOU1000000126_S0000134	i have been teaching my on campus i guess my stanford class using flip classroom for many years now
YOU1000000126_S0000135	with online digital content auto grading and recently like everyone else had to move the live portion of that class to zoom
YOU1000000126_S0000136	and i have really enjoyed and on one hand i missed the deeper you know emotional connection with learners
YOU1000000126_S0000137	and seeing people in 3 d and getting to shake their hands off the glass
YOU1000000126_S0000138	on the flip side i really enjoy interacting with my students in real time via chat
YOU1000000126_S0000139	previously when i asked a question in class one person would get to answer
YOU1000000126_S0000140	now i routinely ask questions in zoom chat and ask every single student in the class to answer
YOU1000000126_S0000141	and i really like that everyone in my classroom digital classroom now gets to participate
YOU1000000126_S0000143	and even though the world has been doing been participating in online education for a long time you know
YOU1000000126_S0000144	8 years of course there are maybe many decades as a society there is still so much more we can do
YOU1000000126_S0000145	you heard ken talk about peer grading using machine learning
YOU1000000126_S0000146	i am really excited about the coursera labs for project guided project work features that namit talked about shavin and talked about many new product features
YOU1000000126_S0000147	and when i look at where online education is now and how much better we can make the experience still in the future
YOU1000000126_S0000148	i think there is still so much to do and i am very confident that 5 years from now we will look back at this incredibly rudimentary things we are doing back in 2020 and say
YOU1000000126_S0000149	wow those things we thought were so advanced in 2020 boy that was so ancient and so archaic
YOU1000000126_S0000150	and we can deliver such a better experience to our learner right now
YOU1000000126_S0000152	and you know i saw we saw a number of newspaper articles about the shortage of jigsaw puzzles right
YOU1000000126_S0000153	because of social distancing the world does not have enough jigsaw puzzles making new jigsaw puzzles is really hard
YOU1000000126_S0000154	but the nice thing about what we can do teaching online is
YOU1000000126_S0000155	if we had digital puzzles the software apps the digital puzzles that can be replicated at scale very quickly
YOU1000000126_S0000156	digital innovation is one of the things that as we innovate as we come up with new forms of pedagogy our community all of you the teachers represented here
YOU1000000126_S0000157	we can quickly take those ideas and replicate that to learners all around the world because the digital medium is easy to scale up
YOU1000000126_S0000159	so with all of the challenges we face and with all of the opportunities
YOU1000000126_S0000161	i think we come back to this fork in the road
YOU1000000126_S0000163	we do face significant the world face significant challenges
YOU1000000126_S0000164	ted talked about universities maybe at a higher risk of closure
YOU1000000126_S0000165	the challenges that society faced and the challenges that all of us in higher education face is creating a fork in the road
YOU1000000126_S0000166	where on one hand we could keep on doing businesses as usual
YOU1000000126_S0000167	and maybe some institutions will be okay we do have very robust some very robust institutions of higher education
YOU1000000126_S0000168	and and maybe we could have instructors teach on zoom but keep a lot of things the same and maybe it maybe some of the institutions will do okay
YOU1000000126_S0000170	but i hope that all of us will step up and rethink how we can best be hopeful to the world because
YOU1000000126_S0000172	with society in crisis with society reaching out to us for help with unemployed learners with people needing help
YOU1000000126_S0000173	i think it is incumbent on all of us to continue to work together to make sure that we are not
YOU1000000126_S0000174	as leaders in education to step up and rethink how we can help the world
YOU1000000126_S0000176	i think this may be a moment that if we as a community no one of us alone can do this
YOU1000000126_S0000177	but that we as a community can rethink how we can use digital tools to serve all of these people that are newly willing to accept digital learning
YOU1000000126_S0000178	then the opportunity is greater than ever and i hope we can build a world bridge a world across time zones
YOU1000000126_S0000179	and build a world where your education does not need a passport
YOU1000000126_S0000181	like most worthwhile endeavors this will be hard work but every day i remain grateful to all of you
YOU1000000126_S0000182	to coursera is partners students on moving forward to build this world
YOU1000000126_S0000183	where anyone in the world can get access to a great education
YOU1000000126_S0000184	and i would like to close just by thanking all of you again
YOU1000000126_S0000185	when we started coursera we had no idea that over the next several years it would blossom to such a large movement
YOU1000000126_S0000186	and i am under no illusions that this could not have been done but for the hard work of all of you of all of our university partners
YOU1000000126_S0000187	and every year education has been in crisis
YOU1000000126_S0000188	but in this moment in time the world needs all of us the world needs all of you more than ever and i hope that all of us will keep on working hard
YOU1000000126_S0000189	and figure out how to use these digital tools to serve learners worldwide when they need us more than ever thank you very much
YOU1000000126_S0000191	thank you andrew
YOU1000000127_S0000001	heat and drought
YOU1000000127_S0000003	rainfall that is grown unpredictable
YOU1000000127_S0000005	storms of catastrophic power
YOU1000000127_S0000007	and rising sea levels
YOU1000000127_S0000009	the paris climate accord highlights the impact of climate change on humanity
YOU1000000127_S0000011	the agreement emphasizes that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet
YOU1000000127_S0000013	and according to the report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change africa is the continent that will be most affected by climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000014	you may know that the data we have 890 idps
YOU1000000127_S0000015	and 390 refugees in 2019 without fully counting 2020 which is a very difficult year
YOU1000000127_S0000016	that we have challenged as humanity that definitely the impact of covid have in all political economic and in our social aspects
YOU1000000127_S0000017	climate change is hitting africa hardest of all although the continent has contributed least to the crisis
YOU1000000127_S0000019	crops are rotting in fields
YOU1000000127_S0000021	herders can no longer find water for their animals
YOU1000000127_S0000023	and the covid 19 pandemic could soon drive another 40 people in sub saharan africa into extreme poverty
YOU1000000127_S0000025	so people is becoming homeless from the extreme weather events and the conflict among the communities is tough so that is the one who lead to the migrations
YOU1000000127_S0000026	we are talking maybe to the international migrations where there are numbers of the peoples killing themselves into mediterranean students in the year
YOU1000000127_S0000027	but there are huge numbers of the peoples who are internally displaced who have to move from one region to another one
YOU1000000127_S0000028	and that creates the conflict among those communities who have to share the resources
YOU1000000127_S0000029	how can we protect and support those who are displaced
YOU1000000127_S0000031	now what the model does is that it has now much more granular data on population exposure which gives a clearer sense of the people who are likely to be displaced by future riverine floods
YOU1000000127_S0000032	and it estimates that on average we can expect 280 people to be displaced by such floods in africa during any given year in the future
YOU1000000127_S0000033	the arctic temperature is more than 7 degrees higher than it was 100 years ago
YOU1000000127_S0000034	this has vast implications for example floods tropical storms droughts around the world
YOU1000000127_S0000035	this shows climate change is far more than an environmental issue
YOU1000000127_S0000036	it has crucial implications for the economy for peace and stability for security and migration policy
YOU1000000127_S0000037	it has therefore become one of the determining factors of foreign policy at large
YOU1000000127_S0000038	the impact of climate change is real not lost in africa
YOU1000000127_S0000039	we are also dealing with the problem of climate apartheid right now so in the sense that the people that are paying the 1st and most brutal price
YOU1000000127_S0000040	look in a particular color and those that historically carry the biggest weight of the so
YOU1000000127_S0000041	we often wonder whether in fact the urgency would be much more if there were more urgent
YOU1000000127_S0000042	immediate impacts happening in europe and so on
YOU1000000127_S0000043	now that is a very negative statement to start with but let me just tell you why i am .
YOU1000000127_S0000044	basically this is no time for us to be being
YOU1000000127_S0000045	pally pally with each other and not talking about the contradictions that exist and not actually getting
YOU1000000127_S0000046	absolutely serious about speaking truth to power we are running out of time
YOU1000000127_S0000047	development is being undermined by climate change and we cannot ignore it and we must address it and we must address it up front
YOU1000000127_S0000048	i really think that we have also to stop seeing migration just negatively
YOU1000000127_S0000049	and this is a key message from my side i think we have to look also at migration as a part of the solution
YOU1000000127_S0000050	most of the time we talk basically about the environmental changes the cause for migration and we frame it as a problem
YOU1000000127_S0000051	and we rarely look at this as an opportunity as an adaptation strategy
YOU1000000127_S0000052	the european in africa is an expat and the african in europe is a migrant it can continue like that
YOU1000000127_S0000054	authorities in freetown have now determined to plant a 10 trees by 2022
YOU1000000127_S0000056	and increase vegetation in the city by 50%
YOU1000000127_S0000058	that will not only help protect residents in the future but also contribute to the fight against climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000060	in addition to these commitments and from the point of view of africa there is need
YOU1000000127_S0000062	to focus on building resilient societies in which people can adapt in place and prosper
YOU1000000127_S0000063	so that there is not need for continuous migration in this regard
YOU1000000127_S0000064	economic development remains one of the most effective ways to increase the capacity to adapt to climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000065	you cannot have climate resilience without economic growth wealth creation and massive job expansion
YOU1000000127_S0000066	and energy of course is tied to everything you need energy for the clean water and sanitation in the city
YOU1000000127_S0000067	you need energy for the lighting to drive the industries that will create economic opportunity and growth
YOU1000000127_S0000069	so you begin to see that nexus between energy water and sanitation energy and health service delivery
YOU1000000127_S0000070	there is a real need for urban planning urban policy which is aligned to environmental management
YOU1000000127_S0000071	and housing stock recognizing this phenomenon of urbanization is here to stay
YOU1000000127_S0000072	if you are going to have an influx of people you need to plan to receive them you need to plan to deliver services
YOU1000000127_S0000073	i think the continent needs to clarify to have a clear understanding on where it wants to go what it needs and how to do it
YOU1000000127_S0000074	it has to be not only a top down approach but also a bottom up approach fully informed by those needs
YOU1000000127_S0000075	should europe turn into even more of a fortress
YOU1000000127_S0000077	or should it instead look for more ways to make legal migration from africa possible
YOU1000000127_S0000079	climate change is a common threat to all of us no country can withdraw from the effects of global warming
YOU1000000127_S0000080	people lose their entire existence because of disasters the political stability of whole regions is at stake
YOU1000000127_S0000081	to work together to ease the effects of climate change is therefore a question of humanity but also of political rationality
YOU1000000127_S0000082	this strategy is about the eu and africa joining forces in a solid equal partnership
YOU1000000127_S0000083	to make the most of the green and the digital transformation
YOU1000000127_S0000085	together we can create decent jobs good livelihoods while also tackling climate change
YOU1000000127_S0000086	how can the international community come together to face the immense challenges ahead
YOU1000000127_S0000088	for
YOU1000000127_S0000089	actually reflect the realities after the 2nd world war but it does not reflect the reality of today
YOU1000000127_S0000090	we have to work not eurocentric but we have to work together with like minded countries worldwide to see to it
YOU1000000127_S0000091	that the rules based international order is observed this cannot be just done by one country by one person
YOU1000000127_S0000092	never let a crisis go to waste there is a huge opportunity to work on where we can see how to indeed between europe and africa work together
YOU1000000127_S0000093	to address these challenges by sharing best practices by sharing experiences and by looking at potential prospects
YOU1000000127_S0000094	i think that germany has to do more this is exactly my expectation
YOU1000000127_S0000095	and i am convinced that climate induced migration is an issue that urgently needs open dialog
YOU1000000127_S0000096	between countries and multilateral platforms to create safe pathways for migration
YOU1000000127_S0000097	to create a status that protects those who are likely to become stateless
YOU1000000127_S0000098	the only failure is to give up it is doable we can do it it was done before
YOU1000000127_S0000099	the key here is to do it differently to do it with creativity and to ensure the needed commitment
YOU1000000127_S0000100	it is about people and we should put back people at the heart of the climate action
YOU1000000127_S0000101	when it comes to the continent a mobile continent is a healthy continent
YOU1000000127_S0000102	when it comes to mobility a mobile continent is a resourceful continent
YOU1000000127_S0000103	we always say nature is everything that we have because nature is the one who are giving us food giving us medicine even the medicine in the pharmacy
YOU1000000127_S0000104	70% of it coming from the nature and then maybe 30% from the chemical
YOU1000000127_S0000105	things that they are adding on it but the expressions and all the substance are coming from nature
YOU1000000127_S0000107	and food are coming from nature we have a window of opportunity from now to the next 9 years or 10 years
YOU1000000127_S0000108	to increase all the ambitions and act now if we did not do that we are going to do this not a turn point
YOU1000000127_S0000110	it is time to act
YOU1000000128_S0000003	good afternoon everybody it is lovely to be back my name is mabel van oranje and as you might know i am a former co chair of ecfr and i am currently a chair emeritus
YOU1000000128_S0000004	and i am really really excited to facilitate this conversation with george soros who as you all know is the man who played an absolutely crucial role in the creation of ecfr
YOU1000000128_S0000005	and before i hand the floor to him i wanted to just maybe draw attention to one or 2 of the features that i find so amazing of george
YOU1000000128_S0000006	because george is somebody who is always ahead of the curve he often sees things long before the general public actually realizes that they are happening
YOU1000000128_S0000007	and i am thinking for example about the fact that he recognized the economic crisis of 2008 he saw it coming before it even hit
YOU1000000128_S0000008	but also i am thinking about an issue that has really been close to his heart for more than 20 years now i think which is criminal justice reform in the united states
YOU1000000128_S0000009	and he has been working for more than 20 years on this and it is really good to see that that is finally getting much more attention as it really deserves
YOU1000000128_S0000011	let us get us closer to home let us get us to europe and one of the things that i have seen george do time and time again in europe is something that also really corrects and that is standing up for the underdog
YOU1000000128_S0000012	and i saw him 1st do that in the early 90s when we were working on the war in the balkans but i have seen him do that also for example in the case of the roma
YOU1000000128_S0000013	and other minorities all over europe refugees etc so with a man who is always willing to pick a good fight to stand up for what is right and to see ahead
YOU1000000128_S0000014	ahead sooner than many of us can see i am really keen to hear from him what is on his mind and where he thinks
YOU1000000128_S0000015	we should all be going george let me give you the floor thank you for being with us
YOU1000000128_S0000017	thank you good afternoon everybody
YOU1000000128_S0000019	we live in a revolutionary history at times like these the range of possibilities is far greater than in normal times
YOU1000000128_S0000021	events that are inconceivable in normal times not only become possible but actually happen
YOU1000000128_S0000023	i have developed an entire conceptual framework based on the thin pillars of fallibility and reflexivity
YOU1000000128_S0000024	to deal with situations like the present
YOU1000000128_S0000026	that is what has allowed me to make a fortune in the financial markets
YOU1000000128_S0000028	in the very 1st days of january of this year i realized that we had entered a global crisis that would change the direction of history
YOU1000000128_S0000030	that is when iranian general soleimani was assassinated in iraq
YOU1000000128_S0000032	that told me
YOU1000000128_S0000033	that countries were more interested in fighting each other than in fighting climate change
YOU1000000128_S0000035	as you know climate change is a global problem and it requires global cooperation to make it under control
YOU1000000128_S0000037	then came the novel coronavirus that thoroughly disrupted people is lives and ended yet another global problem
YOU1000000128_S0000039	what direction will history take
YOU1000000128_S0000041	that is a question nobody can answer because the future depends on decisions that have not yet been taken
YOU1000000128_S0000043	nevertheless i believe my open society foundations are well situated to develop strategies to make the world a better place
YOU1000000128_S0000045	i personally have focused on areas where i have experience and a historical background
YOU1000000128_S0000047	that led me to 2 particular issues that are of global significance
YOU1000000128_S0000049	one is the plan
YOU1000000128_S0000051	for the international monetary fund to issue a new round of special drawing rights
YOU1000000128_S0000053	and to persuade rich countries to donate their allocations which they do not need to poor countries that are desperate for them
YOU1000000128_S0000055	to explain the idea better
YOU1000000128_S0000057	the special drawing rights are synthetic money created by the imf
YOU1000000128_S0000059	sdrs are allocated in accordance with the member countries shareholding in the imf
YOU1000000128_S0000061	rich countries do not need them because they can raise issue money in their own name in the international markets
YOU1000000128_S0000063	the capacity of 4 countries to do so is extremely limited
YOU1000000128_S0000064	that is why it is so important for rich countries to donate their allocations to poor ones
YOU1000000128_S0000066	as regards historically
YOU1000000128_S0000068	i am not sure if we have a technical difficulty whether we have lost george
YOU1000000128_S0000070	the connection with george
YOU1000000128_S0000072	i am afraid we have lost the connection with george so hopefully he will soon come back in and reconnect
YOU1000000128_S0000074	so please be patient
YOU1000000128_S0000076	and i am sorry as i am using different technology
YOU1000000128_S0000079	there you are george george you are back we are reconnected
YOU1000000128_S0000080	very good
YOU1000000128_S0000082	so nevertheless
YOU1000000128_S0000084	enthusiastically endorsed the idea and argued that the best and perhaps only way to raise one or €20
YOU1000000128_S0000085	is by issuing perpetual bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000087	the distinguishing feature of perpetual bonds is that the principal never has to be repaid only the annual interest is due
YOU1000000128_S0000089	this makes them very efficient
YOU1000000128_S0000091	they have a cost benefit ratio that is almost 10 times greater than that of the long term bonds that the commission is proposing to use
YOU1000000128_S0000093	this sounds almost unbelievable but it is true
YOU1000000128_S0000095	assuming 0.5% interest
YOU1000000128_S0000097	which is quite generous in the current low interest rate environment
YOU1000000128_S0000099	€10 would cost only 50 annually
YOU1000000128_S0000101	the interest would have to be paid forever but the present value of future payments diminishes progressively
YOU1000000128_S0000102	until it approaches but does not quite reach 0
YOU1000000128_S0000104	most importantly perpetual bonds could be issued as soon as member states authorize sufficient owned resources
YOU1000000128_S0000105	to maintain the triple a rating of the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000107	own resources would come from newly authorized taxes such as a tax on carbon emissions
YOU1000000128_S0000109	the taxes would only have to be authorized they would not need to be imposed
YOU1000000128_S0000110	because that would take too long and speed is of paramount importance
YOU1000000128_S0000112	the professional bonds do not need to be issued in one go they could be sold in tranches
YOU1000000128_S0000114	the 1st scientists would be snatched up by insurance companies and other long term investors
YOU1000000128_S0000115	who are strung of assets to match their liabilities
YOU1000000128_S0000117	as the market familiarized themselves with the new instrument other investors would be attracted to it
YOU1000000128_S0000119	and as the bond market as the bonds became actively traded
YOU1000000128_S0000121	the european central bank would also be allowed to invest in them
YOU1000000128_S0000123	there is an important distinction between funds raised from the eu is own resources and those that are contributed by member states
YOU1000000128_S0000125	the latter have to be distributed to member states according to their shareholding in the european central bank
YOU1000000128_S0000127	the former can be given by the commission to those who most in need
YOU1000000128_S0000129	that makes all the difference to the effectiveness of the aid that the european union can provide
YOU1000000128_S0000130	for instance
YOU1000000128_S0000132	it could assist those who have lost their livelihood because of the virus
YOU1000000128_S0000133	currently they have to depend on their own governments whose capacities vary
YOU1000000128_S0000134	it would be much more equitable if the support came from the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000136	huh
YOU1000000128_S0000138	why did the member states ignore so studiously an instrument that is ideally suited to the current situation
YOU1000000128_S0000140	they were aware of perpetual bonds because spain championed them at a virtual summit of the european council on april 23rd
YOU1000000128_S0000141	and they were listed as one of the ideas that deserved further consideration
YOU1000000128_S0000143	my guess is that the perpetual bonds were dismissed out of hand
YOU1000000128_S0000144	because they were confused with corona bombs
YOU1000000128_S0000146	the letters were decisively rejected by member states because some of them were unwilling to go that far
YOU1000000128_S0000148	in reality perpetual bonds are the exact opposite of corona bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000150	perpetual bonds reduce the debt burden corona bonds increase it
YOU1000000128_S0000152	to avoid confusion i now try to avoid using the term perpetual bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000154	i prefer to use the word consoles
YOU1000000128_S0000156	that is the name the uk and the us used for centuries to describe perpetual bonds
YOU1000000128_S0000158	the uk started in 1752 and the us in the 1870s
YOU1000000128_S0000160	interestingly the netherlands
YOU1000000128_S0000162	predated the other 2 countries
YOU1000000128_S0000164	a dutch water board issued perpetual bonds in 1648
YOU1000000128_S0000165	to repair a dike
YOU1000000128_S0000167	the bonds are still outstanding
YOU1000000128_S0000168	but the annual interest has become so small that the general public is not even aware of their continued existence
YOU1000000128_S0000170	as far as i know the dutch actually invented the idea
YOU1000000128_S0000171	yet today they are the most ardent opponents
YOU1000000128_S0000172	they are the leaders of the so called frugal 4
YOU1000000128_S0000174	in 1648 the netherlands faced a serious threat from flooding
YOU1000000128_S0000176	today the combination of the virus and climate change poses an even greater danger to the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000178	it would be tragic if europe in general and the frugal 4 in particular failed to give consuls the consideration they deserve
YOU1000000128_S0000180	i recognize that there are bound to be legal objections
YOU1000000128_S0000181	based on the tfeu that contains all the rules that govern the european union
YOU1000000128_S0000183	i believe the objections could be overcome
YOU1000000128_S0000184	by arguing that the authors of the tfeu were not aware of the existence of consoles
YOU1000000128_S0000185	therefore its regulations does not apply to them
YOU1000000128_S0000187	i also anticipate
YOU1000000128_S0000189	moral objections from german speaking people
YOU1000000128_S0000190	the german word schuld has a double meaning debt and guilt
YOU1000000128_S0000192	it follows that debtors should be punished
YOU1000000128_S0000194	that makes perpetual bonds that never have to be repaid morally inadmissible
YOU1000000128_S0000196	there is one legitimate objection that may be raised
YOU1000000128_S0000198	once you start using consoles you may end up abusing them
YOU1000000128_S0000200	but the fact that the large scale use of europe is aaa credit is already designated as a temporary measure
YOU1000000128_S0000202	that should be ensured
YOU1000000128_S0000203	that they would not be used in normal times
YOU1000000128_S0000205	they offer a financial tool ideally suited to the current circumstances
YOU1000000128_S0000207	and they would not be abused in normal times
YOU1000000128_S0000209	so why all this hostility
YOU1000000128_S0000211	i believe the answer is to be found in the sequence of events
YOU1000000128_S0000213	the commission was not aware of perpetual bonds when it proposed a recovery plan
YOU1000000128_S0000215	it was relying on the only instrument over which it had some control namely the budget
YOU1000000128_S0000217	that focused the attention of member states and interest groups
YOU1000000128_S0000218	on how the funds are distributed not on how they were generated
YOU1000000128_S0000220	interested parties are now haggling with each other
YOU1000000128_S0000221	for instance the frugal 4 want to protect their discounts from their contributions to the budget
YOU1000000128_S0000223	it will take time for the authorities to realize that the budget can generate the amount of money the european union needs
YOU1000000128_S0000225	that is when the consoles will be recognized
YOU1000000128_S0000226	as an indispensable financial instrument
YOU1000000128_S0000228	but by that time it may be too late
YOU1000000128_S0000230	we must therefore accelerate the process
YOU1000000128_S0000232	the money is needed now
YOU1000000128_S0000238	and she has fully recovered her political influence
YOU1000000128_S0000240	she also has capable supporters in the ministry of finance
YOU1000000128_S0000242	who understand the merits of consuls
YOU1000000128_S0000244	in addition to dealing with the virus
YOU1000000128_S0000245	consults should also be used to address grammar change
YOU1000000128_S0000247	recently a strong movement has developed
YOU1000000128_S0000249	to raise the 2030 climate target
YOU1000000128_S0000250	from 40% to 55%
YOU1000000128_S0000251	a number of mainly east european countries are objecting that they did not have enough money to meet the higher target
YOU1000000128_S0000253	that could be readily remedied with an additional €10 of consoles
YOU1000000128_S0000254	of course the commission would have to carefully monitor that the funds are not misdirected and misused
YOU1000000128_S0000256	in this way the european union could meet the 2 great challenges of our time
YOU1000000128_S0000257	and fulfill the expectations of its citizens that would be a truly great accomplishment thank you
YOU1000000129_S0000000	there are but a few men in the history of humanity who have accumulated fortunes like that of andrew carnegie a man who was as complex as he was rich
YOU1000000129_S0000001	after selling his company his net worth would equal a staggering 2% of america is gdp
YOU1000000129_S0000002	in today is video we will explore how one scottish immigrant armed with just 5 years of schooling would rise from poverty to the status of the world is richest man

YOU1000000129_S0000008	carnegie was at one point the richest american in history but he was not born in america
YOU1000000129_S0000009	andrew is story begins across the atlantic ocean in dunfermline scotland where he grew up in what could only be described as abject poverty
YOU1000000129_S0000010	his mother would work around the clock sewing shoes his father would make cloth and other material hand weaving looms
YOU1000000129_S0000011	that was of course until the steam powered loom came into the picture with weaving technology rapidly improving his father is loom business would crumble finding himself crushed by the industrial revolution
YOU1000000129_S0000012	watching his father suffer as he begged for work would impact the young carnegie profoundly in 1848 the carnegies set out in search of a better life outside scotland after selling all of their possessions and borrowing £20
YOU1000000129_S0000013	the family embarked on their journey to the land of opportunity america they would restart their lives from scratch in pittsburgh the hub of manufacturing but still found themselves unable to escape hardship in their new country
YOU1000000129_S0000014	his father and mother both struggled to find work leaving andrew no choice but to drop out of school to support his family he would finally catch a break from the scorching heat of the boiler rooms when he landed a job at a local telegraph office
YOU1000000129_S0000015	as a messenger boy he would deliver telegrams by bike all over pittsburgh he would memorize the faces of everyone he delivered to so that he could greet them by name if he saw them outside of work
YOU1000000129_S0000016	it would provide carnegie with a unique opportunity to familiarize himself with the city is business community at 17 he would perfect his telegraph skills he would grow increasingly skilled at hearing morse code
YOU1000000129_S0000017	impressively he could recite messages without needing to write them down this caught the eye of thomas scott a regional manager for the pennsylvania railroad company who hired carnegie to be his personal telegrapher
YOU1000000129_S0000018	and private secretary for the sum of $35 a month at the time the pennsylvania railroad company was the largest corporation in the world
YOU1000000129_S0000019	for the business savvy carnegie it was an opportunity like none other a front row seat on how to run a successful business
YOU1000000129_S0000020	tom scott his boss realized carnegie is potential and decided to take the boy under his wing mentoring him like a 2nd father
YOU1000000129_S0000021	it would later be tom is advice to invest in stocks that provided carnegie with his 1st taste of capitalism fast forward to the american civil war carnegie is drafted into the union but instead of fighting in the war
YOU1000000129_S0000022	carnegie would profit from it he was able to escape harm is way after paying $850 for a substitute to take his place on the battlefield it was during this time that carnegie noticed that the wooden bridges were easily burnt by the troops
YOU1000000129_S0000023	and that there was a desperate need for iron bridges to replace them he capitalized on the opportunity launching the keystone bridge company but it would be his next move that would define him as an astute businessman
YOU1000000129_S0000024	keystone did not just build bridges they also had their very own iron mills which provided the iron that was needed for constructing the bridges
YOU1000000129_S0000025	owning the iron source meant that carnegie is bridge building company would not be dependent on mining or extracting companies for iron like their competitors this not only gave carnegie more control over the entire process it also improved their margins
YOU1000000129_S0000026	after the bridge was built he would leverage his connections in the railroad industry to make money there too essentially he was operating a triad of 3 companies each strengthening one another
YOU1000000129_S0000027	1st a mining extraction company 2nd a bridge building company which used the iron provided from his mining company and then once the bridge was built his 3rd business would monetize by selling rail
YOU1000000129_S0000028	the concept worked to a tee
YOU1000000129_S0000029	always looking for the next big opportunity andrew set his sights on new york city the undisputed business capital of the world in the city he expected to find a hustling culture and mingle with other distinguished businessmen
YOU1000000129_S0000030	but what he found instead was disappointment he would describe the wealthy individuals around him as scoundrels
YOU1000000129_S0000031	carnegie wrote a note to himself promising that in 2 years when he turned 35 he would retire and focus on making the world a better place
YOU1000000129_S0000032	but this note would go unfulfilled in 1856 a new invention by henry bessemer called the bessemer converter
YOU1000000129_S0000034	a pear shaped furnace would allow for the mass production of steel something previously thought to be impossible for the 1st time ever it would finally become feasible to create large structures from steel
YOU1000000129_S0000035	eventually giving birth to the 1st skyscrapers forever transforming a city is skyline carnegie moved with lightning speed successfully building america is 1st steel plants
YOU1000000129_S0000036	in doing so he hired the best engineers and architects that money could buy he focused maniacally on increasing efficiency always using the latest technology and pushing his employees to their maximum physical and mental capabilities
YOU1000000129_S0000037	he was also notorious for requiring employees to work 364 days a year only allowing for rest on the 4th of july
YOU1000000129_S0000038	as technology continued to advance he would seek ways to replace his workers with machines at every possible opportunity
YOU1000000129_S0000039	unlike men machines did not need sleep they also did not ask for raises and they certainly did not try to unionize
YOU1000000129_S0000040	carnegie a master salesman decided to name the venture not carnegie steel but rather j edgar thompson steelworks the name of one of his customers in the railroad industry
YOU1000000129_S0000041	carnegie hoped a steel mill named after a customer would show his appreciation for their business and maybe even secure more orders from their railroad and it did the 1st order from thompson consisted of 2000 steel rails
YOU1000000129_S0000042	naming a mill after a customer was more than a sales gimmick it was part of a larger strategy showing appreciation in public for others
YOU1000000129_S0000043	acts like this would continue to pay massive dividends throughout the titan is career to help run carnegie steel mills he would bring on board a cutthroat executive known for his ruthlessness and attention to the bottom line
YOU1000000129_S0000044	henry clay frick as a teen carnegie and frick were a powerful force to be reckoned with and to show how ruthless the 2 could be look no farther than the story about duquesne works
YOU1000000129_S0000045	with the help of frick carnegie spread a rumor which alleged that duquesne is mill was producing defective steel it was not true but it did not matter
YOU1000000129_S0000046	carnegie claimed to duquesne is railroad customers that their rails lacked what he called homogeneity few if anyone actually knew what the word meant but that was not important
YOU1000000129_S0000047	carnegie used the word because it sounded scary enough to frighten off railroads who were concerned that they were not getting good products if duquesne is sales slowed they would eventually become unprofitable and run out of money
YOU1000000129_S0000048	to expedite their demise carnegie and frick would proceed to undercut duquesne on price further squeezing the company
YOU1000000129_S0000049	within 2 years duquesne is finances were in ruins leaving it no other choice than to sell to none other than carnegie at a bargain price
YOU1000000129_S0000050	for frick and carnegie the rules of engagement were clear do whatever it takes to win but this ruthlessness came with a hefty price as they would soon discover at one of their largest steel plants in homestead pennsylvania
YOU1000000129_S0000051	carnegie had just invested 10s of dollars optimizing the efficiency of homestead enabling it to produce more steel than any other mill comparable to its size
YOU1000000129_S0000052	but there was another part of the profit machine that was yet to be optimized labor costs this posed a problem for carnegie who had been working on rebranding his image from an oppressive steel factory billionaire to a champion of workers rights
YOU1000000129_S0000053	so instead of risking his reputation he would have his right hand lieutenant henry frick execute the dirty work meanwhile carnegie would distance himself traveling abroad to his home country of scotland
YOU1000000129_S0000054	carnegie knew that he would not want to be around the plant after cutting wages for 10000 already frustrated low paid workers
YOU1000000129_S0000055	in 1892 tensions between workers and mill owners were particularly heightened after an ever widening wealth gap continued to grow the richest people in america were accumulating fortunes faster than at any time in american history
YOU1000000129_S0000056	meanwhile workers felt that they were property of the rich and that their shrinking voice could only be heard through a union to make things even worse
YOU1000000129_S0000057	frick who took his orders from carnegie demanded increased factory production which would mean even more hours slaving away but to top it all off frick would not be increasing their income
YOU1000000129_S0000058	he would be reducing it longer hours and less pay put homestead at a boiling point the strikers also demanded safer working conditions and for a good reason
YOU1000000129_S0000059	in 1898 9% of all steelworkers industry wide would die on the job when the workers refused frick is aggressive demands for longer hours and less pay he decided to lock out all employees
YOU1000000129_S0000060	and bring in a substitute group of immigrant workers who would be willing to do their dangerous jobs for less
YOU1000000129_S0000061	to escort the immigrant workers as they made their way to the factory frick called on a 300 person army for hire called the pinkertons armed with rifles
YOU1000000129_S0000062	they made their way to the factory where they were met by 10000 angry strikers refusing to give up what they called home
YOU1000000129_S0000063	historians do not know who fired the 1st gunshot but what we do know is that the day would no longer be called the homestead strike
YOU1000000129_S0000064	but rather the homestead massacre by the end of the battle 9 factory workers and 7 pinkertons would be dead
YOU1000000129_S0000066	100s would be injured the fighting was so extreme that the governor ordered for 8000 militia troops to provide backup under the protection of the state is troops the factory would be reopened
YOU1000000129_S0000067	and unfortunately for carnegie is workers they would be returning with lower pay longer working hours and the same safety conditions
YOU1000000129_S0000068	another collateral damage from homestead came in the form of carnegie is reputation prior to the tragedies at homestead he would often advocate in public for better conditions in steel mills and increased wages
YOU1000000129_S0000069	but these words were far from aligned with his actions hypocrisy was incredibly prevalent while he preached increased wages and improved safety conditions
YOU1000000129_S0000070	he was simultaneously reducing labor costs by slashing paychecks and doing little if anything to make his factories a safer place to work
YOU1000000129_S0000071	carnegie was widely called a coward for using frick as his scapegoat not only for the tragedy but for all the other dirty work that he did not want his name to be associated with
YOU1000000129_S0000072	but in spite of the tensions and animosity the steel mills continued to thrive in fact by 1900 the company would produce more steel than the entire nation of great britain
YOU1000000129_S0000073	but in 1901 carnegie grew tired of the game and wanted to spend time with his wife and daughter
YOU1000000129_S0000074	financier j p morgan was a rising competitor in the steel industry and carnegie now nearing 70 became open to the idea of selling the company he would spent his entire life building
YOU1000000129_S0000075	carnegie wrote on a scrap of paper what he would be willing to accept charles schwab the president of carnegie steel delivered the offer to morgan
YOU1000000129_S0000076	as the story goes j p morgan glanced at the offer and without hesitation accepted it morgan would buy carnegie steel for $480 making carnegie the single richest man in the world at the time
YOU1000000129_S0000077	carnegie would completely cut ties with his business life and dedicate 100% of himself to serving the world through philanthropy not a single dollar would be left to his family
YOU1000000129_S0000078	because andrew had only 5 years of schooling he had a soft spot for libraries which he credits for helping him achieve the financial success he acquired
YOU1000000129_S0000079	over the course of his life he would donate over 2500 libraries to cities all around the world but it was not all self promotion he was generous for generosity is sake his name was only displayed on less than 500 of those libraries
YOU1000000129_S0000080	one example of his generosity is carnegie hall one of new york is most recognizable landmarks built in 1891 carnegie built and donated the building as the music hall
YOU1000000129_S0000081	but its original name of the music hall was only changed to the current version after his death and not by his request but through the music hall is board members and from 1901 until his death in 1919 in lenox massachusetts
YOU1000000129_S0000082	carnegie is full time job was giving away the vast wealth he had built up for himself as we mentioned at the beginning of this story carnegie was a man who was as complex as he was rich
YOU1000000129_S0000083	did he employ abusive labor techniques to keep his factories producing maximum profit yes was he hypocritical of course did he make up slander to put his competitors out of business absolutely
YOU1000000129_S0000084	while these things are all true carnegie is philanthropic impact is also equally great perplexing to say the least how can a man commit such sins and then become a saint
YOU1000000129_S0000085	perhaps he viewed donating his money as a way to atone for his business sins making money is a great feeling but an even better feeling is giving it away if you want to grow wealth and perhaps donate to noble causes like carnegie did

YOU1000000130_S0000000	henry ford one of the most influential american industrialists through his company henry transformed american life and in this video we are going to learn how he did it starting from the very beginning
YOU1000000130_S0000002	this video is brought to you by audible and a big part of it is based on henry ford is biography which you can listen to for free on audible if you register for a free trial with the link in the description
YOU1000000130_S0000003	you should also check out real engineering is video on the manufacturing innovations of the assembly line which he explains masterfully on his channel
YOU1000000130_S0000005	by all accounts henry ford should have been a farmer born in michigan barely 20 years after it had become a state
YOU1000000130_S0000006	henry grew up at a time when farming was slow exhausting and manual which is why unsurprisingly he came to hate it with a passion but whereas most people at the time did not have the fortune to escape what they were born into
YOU1000000130_S0000007	henry was lucky enough to get such an opportunity you see the village he was born into was just 8 miles west of detroit which was rapidly becoming an industrial center thanks to the steam engine
YOU1000000130_S0000008	early on in his childhood henry encountered technology which few children his age could play around with
YOU1000000130_S0000009	he would tinker with the watches of his better off neighbors and by the time he was 12 he could not just take them apart but also put them back together and repair them
YOU1000000130_S0000010	his interest grew into an obsession when he got to observe a working steam engine 1st hand while on a school trip to one of the rail companies in detroit
YOU1000000130_S0000011	by the time henry had become a teenager the steam engine was already making its way into the farming community coal powered threshing machines and sawmills were becoming common sight and henry was learning how they worked and how to fix them
YOU1000000130_S0000012	at the age of 16 he made a big leap forward when against his father is wishes he left his village to go work in detroit where any young mechanic could easily find very lucrative employment
YOU1000000130_S0000013	industry in detroit was booming and it had been doing so for close to 5 decades in 1825 a canal had been dug connecting the hudson river to the great lakes which at the time were effectively their western frontier
YOU1000000130_S0000014	all the untapped resources that had no way of getting out could suddenly be moved by steamboat to new york and in the span of just 50 years detroit is population increased by a factor of 10
YOU1000000130_S0000015	with vast mines in the north producing copper and iron and lumber mills opening up virtually everywhere
YOU1000000130_S0000016	all this metal and wood sustained close to a 1000 companies in detroit alone including the ones in which henry would work at over the course of the 1880s
YOU1000000130_S0000017	it is during this time that henry by chance learned about the gas engine from a british magazine it was being produced in small numbers by a german engineer nicholas otto
YOU1000000130_S0000018	and it was gaining some traction in europe but it was practically unheard of in america henry would get the chance to work on such an engine himself in 1889 and he instantly recognized the advantages it had
YOU1000000130_S0000019	because it did not use steam the engine was much lighter and got rid of the heavy boiler and all the water in it because it did all the combustion internally a much more efficient process
YOU1000000130_S0000020	this also allowed the gas engine to start quickly whereas steam engines of the time needed as much as 30 minutes to heat up the water and generate enough steam to start working the gas engine was an innovation henry fell in love with
YOU1000000130_S0000021	but it was also one he did not fully understand after all he had extensive experience with steam and metal but almost none with electricity and the gas engine was fired by an electric spark
YOU1000000130_S0000022	to obtain this missing knowledge henry went to work for the local branch of the edison illuminating company
YOU1000000130_S0000023	it was generating electricity for over a 1000 homes in detroit and it was doing so by using steam engines so henry was a natural hire for them whenever the engines broke henry had to fix them but whenever they were working
YOU1000000130_S0000024	he was free to do as he wished it was the perfect job that allowed him to spend his days experimenting with gas engines in 1893 when henry had already been promoted to chief engineer at edison
YOU1000000130_S0000025	he created his 1st working gas engine the idea of using the gas engine to create a horseless carriage had been around in henry is mind since he 1st laid eyes on one but actually making that idea a reality would take years of work
YOU1000000130_S0000026	building a car in a world with no car parts was not easy and henry had to figure out every detail through trial and error it took him 3 years of constant effort to produce this the quadricycle
YOU1000000130_S0000027	a simple frame with an engine powered by ethanol and 4 bicycle wheels mounted onto it it had only 2 gears and neither one was for going in reverse but what is worse is that it had no cooling system to speak of
YOU1000000130_S0000028	thus making overheating a constant issue in its 1st year henry made numerous improvements to the quadricycle most notably adding a cooling system and by the time he sold it in 1897 for $200
YOU1000000130_S0000029	he had driven a 1000 miles in it henry built a 2nd quadricycle and then a 3rd one always improving the design before finally feeling confident enough in 1899 to start his own company
YOU1000000130_S0000031	capitalized at $150000 the detroit automobile company was a very ambitious venture many of the detroit elite invested in it including henry is friends from the edison company
YOU1000000130_S0000032	and everyone was eager to see what henry could create with proper capital henry is plan was very clever since he personally knew many of the industrialists in detroit by that point he would try to build an automobile they could use in their businesses
YOU1000000130_S0000033	he leased a factory and planned to hire a 100 workers to make his new delivery wagon as he called it but it turned out that building such complex machines in high numbers was much more difficult than henry imagined
YOU1000000130_S0000034	the vast majority of the parts used in the making of the delivery wagon were produced by other companies and every time a single delivery was late the entire factory would have no choice but to stop working
YOU1000000130_S0000035	the 1st delivery wagon took 6 months to produce and no more than 20 were made in the 1st 2 years of the company is existence by the end of 1902 the other shareholders were sick of henry is lack of progress
YOU1000000130_S0000036	and actually voted to get rid of him now because henry held only 15% of the company he had no choice but to comply
YOU1000000130_S0000037	and interestingly enough the man who took over the detroit automobile company would eventually transform it into cadillac but that is a story for a different time what matters is that henry was pushed out of his own company
YOU1000000130_S0000038	and had only a $1000 to his name it was back to the drawing board and this time henry would take a very different approach instead of targeting businesses with expensive machines henry would design a vehicle to be used by the average man
YOU1000000130_S0000039	you see at the time virtually all cars were high ticket items they were mostly made by skilled craftsmen one at a time and more often than not were designed for racing which was rapidly becoming a favorite american activity
YOU1000000130_S0000040	henry envisioned turning the car from a status symbol into a commodity but doing that would not be easy and in fact it took henry 20 different design iterations before he finally got one that worked
YOU1000000130_S0000041	henry labeled his 1st design as the model a and worked his way through the alphabet over the next 5 years sustained by capital from his friends and family
YOU1000000130_S0000042	but what changed the most during this time is not the car itself but the production process henry learned the importance of having a reliable supply chain when his 1st company failed which is why this time around
YOU1000000130_S0000043	he tried getting as many parts as possible from the same manufacturer the one he chose will probably sound familiar the dodge brothers company a machine shop in detroit that would eventually evolve into the eponymous american brand
YOU1000000130_S0000044	the biggest game changer of all however was henry is chance visit to a slaughterhouse in chicago he saw there something interesting a disassembly line so to speak where multiple workers would process carcasses moving down a line
YOU1000000130_S0000045	henry figured he could use the same process but in reverse an assembly line using the money he had saved from some of his earlier models which were also assembled by the dodge brothers
YOU1000000130_S0000046	henry was able to build a factory of his own in 1904 where he could experiment with the assembly line process by 1905 the ford factory employed over 300 people that built 25 cars a day
YOU1000000130_S0000047	but henry still had not figured everything out he was producing multiple different models at the same time which prevented him from properly using an assembly line
YOU1000000130_S0000048	nevertheless there was a sign of things to come the affordable model n created in 1906 became the best selling car in the us and ford became the biggest car producer in america
YOU1000000130_S0000049	it is actually during the production of this model that henry would 1st use the assembly line process to at least partially assemble some of his cars
YOU1000000130_S0000050	it was not a full moving assembly line but nevertheless this experiment increased production by a factor of 5 in the same factory logistics of course was another big part of henry is success
YOU1000000130_S0000051	in 1905 he created the ford manufacturing company complete with its own factory to start making the engines and transmissions of henry is cars to further eliminate any possibility of delays
YOU1000000130_S0000052	but the biggest factor in henry is success came from perhaps the most unexpected place peru now this is a story you are not going to hear anywhere else so listen carefully
YOU1000000130_S0000053	in 1907 henry began construction of a heat treatment plant to produce vanadium steel
YOU1000000130_S0000054	this alloy was new to america in fact few furnaces in the us could even reach the temperature needed to manufacture it the difficulty in producing it however was worth it
YOU1000000130_S0000055	because vanadium steel was more than twice as strong as regular steel while actually being lighter now at the time vanadium metallurgy was cutting edge research
YOU1000000130_S0000056	but henry had an extremely lucky connection he was friends with the 2 brothers who owned the one vanadium mine in peru producing 92% of the world is supply
YOU1000000130_S0000057	joseph and james flannery had commercialized vanadium steel in europe and in the us by selling it to rail companies but their peruvian mine was producing so much vanadium that they had to do something else with it
YOU1000000130_S0000059	they sold vanadium steel to the us government for the construction of the panama canal but even that was not enough so when they met henry in 1906 they immediately made him an offer
YOU1000000130_S0000060	they would help him transition his entire manufacturing process to use vanadium steel it was their chief engineer that built the heat treatment plant for henry in 1907
YOU1000000130_S0000061	and it was their company that supplied ford with all the vanadium it needed for its cars the 1st ford car designed with vanadium steel was the model t in 1908 and it was this alloy that actually made it successful
YOU1000000130_S0000062	it was not the cheapest car henry had made the model n and its upscale versions were actually cheaper but it did not need to be because it was by far the best car built at the time much stronger than any competitor
YOU1000000130_S0000063	the sheer difference in quality was the only marketing henry needed and within weeks of the model t is release ford received 25000 orders for it
YOU1000000130_S0000064	even though it managed to produce only 17000 units for the entirety of 1909 henry realized just how big of a deal the model t was which is why he built a 2nd factory in 1910
YOU1000000130_S0000065	and it is there that he would perfect the moving assembly line in 1913 during this period production would double every year in 1910 he built 20000 model ts
YOU1000000130_S0000066	and just 6 years later he was building over half a 10 at the same time henry adopted another brilliant strategy he was constantly reducing the price of his cars to further increase his market share
YOU1000000130_S0000067	in fact during these 6 years he cut the model ts price by more than half by 1918 half of all cars in america were model ts and this trend would continue well into the 1920s
YOU1000000130_S0000068	henry had begun a new age in american history the age of the automobile and it was his company that would totally dominate it in its 1st 2 decades
YOU1000000130_S0000069	it was not until the end of the 1920s that the rest of the auto industry caught up to henry but at that point he was already one of the richest men alive
YOU1000000130_S0000070	in 1922 he actually took the time to write an autobiography where parts of this video came from and which you can listen to for free as part of your 30 day free trial of audible

YOU1000000131_S0000007	he would spend weeks away from home and in fact would have several children with another woman who he decided to bring back home to his wife
YOU1000000131_S0000008	so they could all live together in this very confusing household john would grow up learning how to hustle people for the best deal possible and how to get the most out of every penny he got his family would rarely stay in one place for long
YOU1000000131_S0000009	and john would live this nomadic lifestyle ever since he was 3 years old to help his mother john would earn any money he could by raising turkeys or doing work for neighbors his intelligence was put to good use
YOU1000000131_S0000010	when the family moved to cleveland ohio in 1854 where he got the chance to attend a proper school but less than a year later john dropped out in order to work as a bookkeeper at a local produce broker he would earn ¢50 per day
YOU1000000131_S0000011	which obviously was not much at the time so he would help other companies on the side but after 2 years of working there his bosses refused to give him a meaningful raise so he decided to one up them by starting his own produce brokerage
YOU1000000131_S0000012	thanks to his good reputation he got a loan of $4000 which at the time was a huge sum john started trading hay grain and various meats and in his 1st year he recorded sales of half a $10
YOU1000000131_S0000013	of which he only got a small fraction as commissions but still it was a huge success every bank in cleveland was begging john to borrow money and he was barely 18 years old but then in 1859
YOU1000000131_S0000014	something happened that would change his life forever just a 100 miles east of cleveland the 1st american oil well had been discovered this marked the beginning of the pennsylvania oil rush and within a year
YOU1000000131_S0000015	4500 barrels of oil would be produced now back then oil was not quite as valuable as it is today gasoline cars had not been invented yet but oil could still be processed into kerosene which people would then use in lamps
YOU1000000131_S0000016	john realized however that the biggest profits to be had were not in drilling for oil but in refining it he witnessed many people going bust before striking oil so he knew that the business was too risky for him
YOU1000000131_S0000017	instead he would let others go through the hassle of finding the oil and he would just buy it off of them john had to wait until 1863 for the government to build a rail line connecting the pennsylvania oil fields to cleveland
YOU1000000131_S0000018	but when that line was built john was ready for it with a long line of partners and banks ready to back him up he also assembled a team of seasoned chemists and engineers who not only optimized the refining process but also discovered various uses
YOU1000000131_S0000019	for the byproducts of refining petroleum you see the early refineries in cleveland could only operate at about a 60% efficiency but john not only increased that percentage he also started selling all the byproducts like paraffin wax
YOU1000000131_S0000020	tar and naphtha within 2 years the rockefeller refinery was worth over $70000 and was among the largest in cleveland but john was not done
YOU1000000131_S0000021	in 1865 there were 26 competing refineries but within 5 years john had acquired all but 4 of them
YOU1000000131_S0000023	by this point his business was getting too big to handle as a partnership so in 1870 he incorporated as standard oil of ohio to convince the few remaining competitors in cleveland john would simply invite them over and show them his books
YOU1000000131_S0000024	revealing that he could operate at a loss far longer than they could stay solvent in exchange for a good buyout price john would offer his competitors positions in his own company thus placing the brightest minds in the industry under his control
YOU1000000131_S0000025	of course not everyone would give up immediately and over time john eroded the price of oil and kerosene sometimes by as much as 80% in order to strangle competitors unsurprisingly his strategy worked
YOU1000000131_S0000026	by 1880 he had acquired refineries across the northeastern us and was refining over 90% of the entire country is oil production at this point john was so powerful that he could invite the owners of the big rail companies
YOU1000000131_S0000027	and personally negotiate rebates for using their trains but this practice of negotiating backroom deals really got the business world riled up at the time and still kind of today most industrial goods were transported by rail
YOU1000000131_S0000028	and many big industrialists got worried
YOU1000000131_S0000030	that john is abuse of transportation rebates could result in similar monopolization in their industries
YOU1000000131_S0000031	over the next decade businessmen politicians and the media would attack standard oil with increasing ferocity legislators in ohio began drafting antitrust regulations to bring down rockefeller but he was one step ahead
YOU1000000131_S0000032	in 1882 he reincorporated in new jersey this time creating the standard oil trust which in turn held stakes in over 40 local companies
YOU1000000131_S0000033	then to showcase his success john built an impressive headquarters for his company on broadway this moment was the high point of rockefeller standard oil
YOU1000000131_S0000034	he owned 20000 oil wells 4000 miles of pipeline and employed over 10 people but his grip on the oil industry was loosening both domestically and abroad
YOU1000000131_S0000035	massive oil deposits had been discovered in russia and in asia and were being developed by the rothschild family which spared no effort in getting that oil to america
YOU1000000131_S0000036	worse yet in 1890 the federal government passed the sherman antitrust act which officially gave politicians the teeth to go after the standard oil trust itself
YOU1000000131_S0000037	of course the complex legal structure behind all the companies was very difficult to investigate which is why the government could not actually break up standard oil until 1911
YOU1000000131_S0000038	by that point however john rockefeller had already cashed in and was no longer actively managing the company in the final 20 years of his company is existence it had paid out over half a $10 in dividends
YOU1000000131_S0000039	by some estimates the true worth of standard oil at its peak was $10 so the breakup did not really come as a surprise to most people in 1911 the supreme court found standard oil guilty of anti competitive practices
YOU1000000131_S0000040	and broke the company up into 34 separate entities of course john rockefeller kept his stake in those companies until his death and in fact it turns out that the breakup was the most profitable event in his life
YOU1000000131_S0000041	you will see over time many of those companies merged back with one another today most of the standard remnants are part of either exxonmobil chevron or bp which have since become incredibly large companies in their own right
YOU1000000131_S0000042	john rockefeller is ownership of these successor companies made him the richest businessman to have ever lived with an estimated net worth of $40 even today no one has beaten rockefeller in the leaderboard
YOU1000000131_S0000043	not even jeff bezos himself seems likely to achieve that but there is one thing that jeff bezos does have that john rockefeller never did despite all his money and that is access to dollar shave club
YOU1000000131_S0000044	i mean look at him it is clear that this man cares very much about looking and feeling at his very best but guess what you too can experience the splendor of dollar shave club is daily essentials starter set
YOU1000000131_S0000045	which by the way new members can get for just $5 that set includes shave butter body wash and one wipe charlie is butt wipes to really make you feel special and if that was not enough you also get their executive razor

YOU1000000131_S0000048	anyhow we will see each other again in 2 weeks and until then stay smart
YOU1000000132_S0000000	the rothschild banking dynasty easily one of the wealthiest families in history but also the single largest source of conspiracy theories
YOU1000000132_S0000001	the vast and shrouded wealth of the wrathshields has endured for generations and has unsurprisingly made it hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction
YOU1000000132_S0000002	in this video we are going back to the earliest days of this famous jewish family to see how they managed to build one of the greatest fortunes in history at a time of rampant anti semitism
YOU1000000132_S0000003	this video is brought to you by skillshare with whom i have partnered to make a series of educational videos on the stock market which you can watch for free by using the link in the description our story begins in medieval europe
YOU1000000132_S0000004	by the 10th century most of europe was under the domain of christianity political power was invariably tied to religion which made being a non christian very unfavorable perhaps the biggest victims of these circumstances were the jews
YOU1000000132_S0000005	having no home state of their own to fall back to the jews were scattered throughout europe and many of them settled in the holy roman empire
YOU1000000132_S0000006	this vast multi ethnic state contained modern day germany and like the rest of europe it too was not happy to harbor the jews
YOU1000000132_S0000007	in many cities the jews were forced to live in particular neighborhoods in what we now call ghettos and the city of frankfurt was no exception
YOU1000000132_S0000008	from 1462 onwards it confined all the jews in the city to a single narrow street outside the city walls that street came to be known as the judengasse or the jewish alley and it was made up of numerous tightly packed houses
YOU1000000132_S0000009	back then the buildings were not distinguished by numbers but by signs one building could be the house of the ship for example while another could be the house of the golden stone the sign on one of those houses was a red shield
YOU1000000132_S0000010	or rathschild in german and the family living in the house had gone by the same name since at least 1528 like most jewish families at the time the rathschilds were involved in finance
YOU1000000132_S0000011	you see in medieval europe christianity forbade anyone from lending money with interest leaving this otherwise profitable business into the hands of the jews experience with money lending and by extension anything relating to finance was passed down generations
YOU1000000132_S0000012	and rothschilds were no exception they specialized in exchanging currencies and trading collectible coins and the best one of them all was meyer rothschild he took up the family business in 1763 and his extensive collection of coins
YOU1000000132_S0000013	attracted the wealthiest aristocrats in the holy roman empire among them was crown prince wilhelm of hesse the prince met meyer in 1769 and quickly learned to trust him with all matters relating not just to collectible coins
YOU1000000132_S0000014	but anything financial when wilhelm came into power as wilhelm ix of hesse in 1785 he hired meyer to manage his finances as his hofjude or court jew now keep in mind this was a common arrangement in central europe
YOU1000000132_S0000015	the nobility would outsource their finances to jews in exchange for protection money and sometimes even actual noble titles meyer oversaw the taxes collected in wilhelm is lands and had to keep his money safe
YOU1000000132_S0000016	a task that became very difficult in 1806 that is the year when napoleon invaded hesse driving wilhelm into exile and putting his fortune at risk but meyer was smart and he was ready for napoleon
YOU1000000132_S0000017	in 1798 he had sent one of his 5 sons nathan rothschild to london to start a currency business similar to his father is with this foundation in place meyer had no trouble moving wilhelm is fortune to london
YOU1000000132_S0000018	where he then loaned it out to the british crown in essence wilhelm was funding the british to fight napoleon in order to restore his power now meyer died in 1812 leaving wilhelm is fortune and the rothschild legacy in the hands of nathan
YOU1000000132_S0000019	he remained in london while his eldest brother took over the original frankfurt business meanwhile the 3 remaining brothers scattered throughout europe establishing branches in important european capitals
YOU1000000132_S0000020	despite the distance the brothers applied a unified strategy they would loan out their money to the aristocracy and to local governments the brother in france for example became the banker of leopold i of belgium
YOU1000000132_S0000021	while the one in vienna would lend money to the last holy roman emperor francis ii in 1818 he would grant all 5 brothers the noble title of baron finally elevating the rothschilds to nobility
YOU1000000132_S0000022	throughout the next decades whenever a european government collapsed and was replaced it was the rothschilds who were 1st in line to provide loans that is exactly what happened after the french revolution of 1830 or after the fall of the holy roman empire
YOU1000000132_S0000023	the loaning business was immensely successful the paris branch for example grew from the equivalent of $50 in 1820 to over half a $10 in 1850
YOU1000000132_S0000024	in essence the 5 rothschild banking families back then provided the same service that the international monetary fund provides today they stabilized major currencies and provided loans to governments doing both at a great profit
YOU1000000132_S0000026	of course throughout the 19th century the 5 branches also made many private investments beyond their government loans in 1868 they purchased one of the most valuable wine estates in france
YOU1000000132_S0000027	in 1875 they acquired a minority stake in the suez canal from egypt while in 1883 they funded the development of the 1st major oil well in the old world challenging the rockefeller monopoly in america
YOU1000000132_S0000028	they also became majority shareholders in the diamond monopoly of de beers and in rio tinto one of the world is largest mining companies but during the 20th century the newer generations of the 5 rothschild families made fewer and fewer successful moves
YOU1000000132_S0000029	in 1900 the branch in naples actually became extinct when the last male heir died without children leaving his fortune to the branch in paris a somewhat amusing fate befell the branch in germany
YOU1000000132_S0000030	there the 2 rothschild heirs had 11 girls and not a single boy splitting up the fortune and disintegrating its power the rothschild branch in austria was doing well until hitler came to power of course
YOU1000000132_S0000031	when nazi germany annexed austria in 1938 the rothschilds had to sell their banking operation for a fraction of its true worth most of them escaped with whatever liquid assets they had but at least one was captured on his way out
YOU1000000132_S0000032	and in fact he was only released after paying the largest ransom in history at the time $210 the ransom effectively bankrupted the austrian rothschilds while the nazis seized all their mansions businesses and art
YOU1000000132_S0000033	a few years later exactly the same thing happened to the branch in paris in fact the collections they had were so exquisite that hitler and hermann goring personally went there to observe them and to pick out what they liked
YOU1000000132_S0000034	through the detailed inventories compiled by the nazis we know that they seized a total of 5003 objects from the rothschild collections and a vast majority of them were never returned
YOU1000000132_S0000035	the french rothschilds had some luck in restoring their businesses after the war but then the french socialists nationalized their bank in 1981 in the end only the english branch survived the 20th century with its fortune intact
YOU1000000132_S0000036	its patriarch during the 2nd half of the 20th century was sir evelyn rothschild who even today is the financial advisor to queen elizabeth he retired from leadership in 2003 passing the mantle of patriarch to david rothschild
YOU1000000132_S0000037	a member of the branch in paris who then merged both branches into a single entity he ensured the secrecy of the family is fortune by establishing a complex network of shell companies starting off in switzerland but ending god knows where
YOU1000000132_S0000038	but at the end of the day while the 19th century banking family might have been one of the richest of its day today the rothschilds are a shadow of their former glory in fact if you open up the forbes list of billionaires
YOU1000000132_S0000039	the 1st rothschild appears at number 822 that is jeff rothschild a man who actually has nothing to do with the rothschild banking family
YOU1000000132_S0000040	he has no blood connection he just happens to share the name in the same way that 2 men bearing the family name goldman might not be related the 1st actual rothschild appearing on this list is only at number 1284
YOU1000000132_S0000041	and his wealth is tied to an asset management company that manages other people is money so in the end it turns out that the once powerful rothschild family is really nothing more but a blip on the radar of global wealth
YOU1000000132_S0000042	and it honestly makes sense statistically 90% of wealthy families lose their fortunes by the 3rd generation it is just hard to be financially responsible when you are born into wealth and have no respect for money
YOU1000000132_S0000043	why bother learning how to invest and grow your wealth when you can just spend whatever grandpa left you well if you want to escape this vicious cycle or at least kick the can down the road for another generation
YOU1000000132_S0000044	you will be happy to learn that i made a series of educational videos on skillshare about how the stock market works in these short animated clips i cover basic topics like what is a stock or an etf or why companies go public

YOU1000000132_S0000048	anyway thank you for watching if you liked this video make sure to give it a thumbs up and also consider subscribing a big thank you to all my patrons on patreon for supporting me and for making business casual possible
YOU1000000132_S0000049	we will see each other again in 2 weeks and until then stay smart
YOU1000000133_S0000000	the internet has completely changed the way we watch television gone are the days when the whole family would gather in the living room to enjoy the exact same program as everyone else
YOU1000000133_S0000001	technology has advanced to the point where we have dumped the old immovable boxes in favor of our phones and computers in today is world you can watch whatever you want whenever you want on demand straight from the internet
YOU1000000133_S0000002	we are now in the age of video on demand and so this week on behind the business we will be taking a look at the company that lies at the heart of this recent revolution netflix
YOU1000000133_S0000004	the year is 1991 and reed hastings was getting ready to start his 1st company hastings was a rather unusual tech entrepreneur
YOU1000000133_S0000005	he came from minnesota and after graduating from college and serving briefly in the military he decided to travel to swaziland with the peace corps to teach math
YOU1000000133_S0000006	after returning to the us and getting a master is in computer science he and 2 of his friends started a company in 1991 called pure software the company sold a range of debugging tools for unix operating systems at a time when there were few good ones on the market
YOU1000000133_S0000007	and so it rapidly became a big player in the it world it doubled its revenue every year for 4 years in a row and in 1996 it was sold to rational software for $70
YOU1000000133_S0000008	in the span of half a decade hastings had become a millionaire
YOU1000000133_S0000009	life seemed great but in 1997 he suffered an inconvenience that would eventually become a world changer hastings had forgotten to return his video rental of apollo 13 and as a result was slapped with a $40 late fee
YOU1000000133_S0000010	he was embarrassed and did not want to tell his wife and that got him thinking of a solution not just a solution to his own late fee problem but a solution to everyone is problem an entirely new system of film rental that would make late fees obsolete
YOU1000000133_S0000011	together with a friend of his on august 29th 1997 in scotts valley california hastings founded a brand new movie rental service called netflix with the idea of mailing dvds to paying customers
YOU1000000133_S0000012	the creation of netflix was essentially a bet on the dvd player now the dvd player had been invented in taiwan in 1994 by sony but it would not be until march 1997 that one was 1st sold in the us
YOU1000000133_S0000013	back then a player cost over a $1000 and when netflix was formed less than one of americans actually owned one
YOU1000000133_S0000014	in a move that seemed insane at the time hastings gambled everything on the potential of dvd technology to replace the bulkier lower resolution videotape as the nation is format of choice
YOU1000000133_S0000015	in 1997 it was almost impossible for people to rent dvds because very few places had any
YOU1000000133_S0000016	after trying over 200 different mailing packages and testing them out by mailing them to himself hastings discovered that he could safely ship a dvd for the small cost of a 1st class mailstamp
YOU1000000133_S0000017	this way netflix could guarantee that most titles would be in stock and by enclosing a stamped return mailer they could make the experience of film rental as convenient as possible
YOU1000000133_S0000018	this on april 14th 1998 with 30 employees and an assortment of 925 titles netflix opened for business
YOU1000000133_S0000019	their 1st offer was for a 7 day rental at the price of $4 plus a $2 shipping fee they also introduced something that is now one of netflix is proudest hallmarks smart suggestion algorithms
YOU1000000133_S0000020	once a customer had rented enough titles netflix could automatically suggest new movies that were likely to interest them nowadays when google and facebook know everything about us it is easy to take such algorithms for granted but in 1997 they were practically unheard of
YOU1000000133_S0000021	netflix started strong and just 48 hours after opening they had to upgrade their website is bandwidth due to the excessive traffic they were receiving
YOU1000000133_S0000022	soon netflix signed promotional deals with toshiba hewlett packard and sony whereby they offered free rentals to people who bought new dvd players
YOU1000000133_S0000023	in july 1999 netflix secured a $30 capital injection from group r 0 which allowed them to start a subscription based service called the marquee program
YOU1000000133_S0000024	for just under $16 per month customers could rent out as many dvds as they wanted as long as they had no more than 4 dvds at any given time no late fees no due dates it was perfect
YOU1000000133_S0000025	by that point netflix was already receiving 10000 dvd orders every day but their total revenue was sitting at barely $50 compare this to blockbuster is $450 revenue and you will probably see why netflix decided to try to team up with them
YOU1000000133_S0000026	blockbuster was one of the oldest video rental companies and it was by far the largest with 60000 employees and 8000 stores spread across the us
YOU1000000133_S0000027	as the popularity of netflix grew everyone thought blockbuster would soon enter the market and with their vast resources they would have probably crushed their young competitor
YOU1000000133_S0000028	that is why netflix decided to act 1st and so in the early year 2000 they invited blockbuster to become a strategic partner and investor
YOU1000000133_S0000029	netflix would become the internet arm of the blockbuster brand dropping the netflix name altogether in favor of blockbuster com
YOU1000000133_S0000030	blockbuster laughed them out of the boardroom they were certain netflix would crumble as it had yet to turn a profit 3 years after its creation instead a few months later blockbuster partnered up with enron broadband
YOU1000000133_S0000031	a division of the energy company you probably know today for its notoriously fraudulent accounting practices
YOU1000000133_S0000033	of course at the time nobody knew that and so investors praised blockbuster is decision the situation for netflix looked grim they were losing money fast and by the end of the year they reported a net loss of $570
YOU1000000133_S0000034	despite doubts coming from all sides hastings was convinced that dvd technology would prevail the only thing that mattered to him was to simply survive until that happened and 2001 was the year when things finally started going his way
YOU1000000133_S0000035	the price of dvd players plummeted with some going around for less than a 100 bucks 2001 also saw the 9 11 terrorist attacks fearful americans took refuge in their homes and netflix subscriptions skyrocketed
YOU1000000133_S0000036	despite growing at an unprecedented rate netflix still had not turned a profit and so in 2002 they went public to keep the company going in 2003 they crossed the 10 subscriber mark and finally had their 1st profitable year
YOU1000000133_S0000037	just as their fortunes started to turn however in 2004 blockbuster finally released their own online dvd mail service before long walmart also joined the fray and a 3 way battle to undercut one another ensued
YOU1000000133_S0000038	blockbuster and walmart however were a bit late to the party hastings admitted that if they had started 2 years earlier they probably would have won on an end of year conference call hastings declared
YOU1000000133_S0000039	when the ceo of blockbuster heard that he promptly had a kitchen sink delivered to the netflix office a fairly creative way of declaring war
YOU1000000133_S0000040	as the competitors undercut one another netflix saw its brief profitability evaporate and its stock fell by 75%
YOU1000000133_S0000041	despite losing money they kept on growing and by 2005 netflix was shipping 10 dvds every day from their assortment of over 35000 titles eventually this drawn out battle of attrition took its toll
YOU1000000133_S0000042	and in 2005 walmart decided to quit blockbuster followed suit and as the era of brick and mortar video rental came to an end so did their success in 2008 the same ceo that had rejected netflix was fired
YOU1000000133_S0000043	and by 2010 blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy netflix had emerged victorious and in 2007 it celebrated the delivery of its 10th dvd then in a single announcement hastings began the journey of making the very bedrock of his company obsolete
YOU1000000133_S0000044	this was his endgame the reason he had been willing to sacrifice prophets for so long and the same reason he had prophetically cited back in the year 2000 video on demand
YOU1000000133_S0000046	netflix 1st started offering streaming of on demand videos in 2007 and initially the service was at no additional charge at 1st movie rights were hard to come by and the videos available to stream on netflix were well pretty awful
YOU1000000133_S0000047	but in october 2008 they signed a deal with premium cable outlet starus which brought in some huge disney and sony library releases the deal cost netflix only $20 a price they soon discovered was an absolute bargain
YOU1000000133_S0000048	the reason netflix got such a great price was because they were the only big player in town and pretty soon they signed deals with paramount mgm and lionsgate
YOU1000000133_S0000049	netflix were also pushing for partnerships with other brands and before long they were featured on nearly every major entertainment system on the planet they buddied up with apple playstation xbox nintendo wii and a bunch of other brands
YOU1000000133_S0000050	by 2010 nearly 30% of all north american broadband traffic during peak hours came from netflix they expanded into canada in 2010 latin america and the caribbean in 2011 and europe in 2012
YOU1000000133_S0000051	2011 turned out to be a year of huge surprises for netflix in response to the ever increasing cost of content streaming licenses netflix announced the production of their 1st piece of original content it would be a political drama called house of cards
YOU1000000133_S0000052	featuring kevin spacey and directed by david fincher netflix managed to outbid hbo by ordering the 1st 2 seasons up front for $10 in october of that year however netflix made a much less successful move
YOU1000000133_S0000053	they introduced a new service called quickster which yes is spelled with a w in reality there was nothing new about quickster at all it was basically the spin off of netflix is old dvd rental service
YOU1000000133_S0000054	the branding was sloppy unimaginative and just not thought out but the public is response to quickster was even worse netflix lost 80 subscribers in a single month and 3 months later their shares had lost 2 thirds of their value
YOU1000000133_S0000055	unsurprisingly they shut quickster down the very next month bringing the 2 arms of the business back together the 1st piece of netflix original content was lilyhammer which aired on february 6th 2012
YOU1000000133_S0000056	it was a relative success and it paved the way for the bigger shows that were to follow in 20131st and foremost was house of cards which 1st aired on february 1st and became one of netflix is most acclaimed titles
YOU1000000133_S0000057	airing the entire 1st season all at once was a bold move by netflix and it revolutionized the way people watch tv shows following the same format came arrested development in may and orange is the new black in july
YOU1000000133_S0000058	netflix continued to use suggestion algorithms to keep people glued to their computers watching series after series each available when it is entirely on demand
YOU1000000133_S0000060	these algorithms have become exponentially smarter in recent years and they can now spot gaps in the market giving netflix a medge in developing new shows
YOU1000000133_S0000061	at this point netflix can create original content based solely on what their customers want before they even know they want it
YOU1000000133_S0000062	that strategy has worked out marvelously for them so far and in 2013 netflix received 14 emmy nominations 9 of which were for house of cards
YOU1000000133_S0000063	they continue to create original content from tv series to documentaries to movies though perhaps their faith in adam sandler with whom they are releasing 4 new movies is somewhat misplaced
YOU1000000133_S0000064	by the end of 2016 netflix will have released 600 hours of new original content for the year and they will have spent a whopping $60 on content acquisition this aggressive expansion is the only option they have
YOU1000000133_S0000065	with amazon and hulu knocking on the door with their own on demand services and original content recently netflix integrated its service with comcast is x one platform a deal that could bring them upwards of 40 new subscribers
YOU1000000133_S0000066	in such a competitive market however a single mistake can be deadly and there are more than enough companies out there eagerly awaiting netflix is next stumble it is still on top at the moment but the real question is how long can it stay there

YOU1000000134_S0000001	i said mister gates what is your nightmare and i thought he would say apple or netscape or oracle and he said i will tell you what i worry about
YOU1000000134_S0000002	i worry about some guy in a garage inventing a new technology microsoft has never thought about
YOU1000000134_S0000004	well in 982 guys were in a garage and a hand letted sign and it said google worldwide headquarters
YOU1000000134_S0000006	in an industry where innovation is just part of the job description larry page and sergey brin have become virtual masters of the universe of information gathering
YOU1000000134_S0000007	what we do not know we google
YOU1000000134_S0000008	629000 results wow and all this time i thought googling yourself meant the other thing
YOU1000000134_S0000009	not anymore
YOU1000000134_S0000010	silicon valley is littered with startups that have stalled out
YOU1000000134_S0000011	why these 2 computer science geeks succeeded may have a lot to do with the nearly parallel lives they led before creating together one of the world is largest and most powerful companies
YOU1000000134_S0000012	brin and paige respectfully declined to participate in this program
YOU1000000134_S0000014	sergei brin was born in the soviet union in 1973 his parents were mathematicians and jewish which limited their career opportunities
YOU1000000134_S0000016	mark malseed is the co author of the google story
YOU1000000134_S0000017	so sergei is father went to a conference in warsaw met a whole bunch of colleagues from the west saw what life was like outside the soviet union came back sat the family down and said we have to leave
YOU1000000134_S0000019	his parents brought with them a sense of purpose they instilled in their son it boiled down to a simple message
YOU1000000134_S0000020	do not come back with a b do not come back with a 2nd place award make it 1st
YOU1000000134_S0000021	and sergey internalized this and it did form a core part of his personality
YOU1000000134_S0000022	like bryn larry page was born in 1973
YOU1000000134_S0000024	his family lived in michigan and his father was the 1st person in his family to get a college degree
YOU1000000134_S0000025	both of his parents were in similar fields as brins
YOU1000000134_S0000027	they were a 2nd generation computer science which at that time was very unusual because computer science was really only developing as a field
YOU1000000134_S0000028	in the 60s and here both of their parents were advanced degrees
YOU1000000134_S0000029	they see themselves as on a mission and that mission it really does spring from
YOU1000000134_S0000031	in 2009 page shared that mission with the graduating class at the university of michigan
YOU1000000134_S0000032	you know what it is like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream and you know how if you do not have a pencil and pad by the bed
YOU1000000134_S0000033	it will be completely gone by the next morning i had one of those dreams when i was 23
YOU1000000134_S0000034	when i suddenly woke up i was thinking what if we could download the whole web and just keep the links and i grabbed a pen and started writing
YOU1000000134_S0000035	soon after i told my advisor terry winograd
YOU1000000134_S0000036	it would take a couple of weeks for me to download the web he nodded knowingly fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough not to tell me
YOU1000000134_S0000038	stanford professor and engineering consultant to google terry winograd
YOU1000000134_S0000039	larry just thinks of ways of doing things that you might not expect sergey was a lot like larry he also was someone who really wanted to think outside the box to say if that sounds like it is impossible let us try it
YOU1000000134_S0000040	it was 1995 at stanford university when the headstrong overachievers 1st met
YOU1000000134_S0000042	one of their stanford professors used to say well the difference between the 2 of them was that sergey would just burst into my office without asking larry would knock and then burst in
YOU1000000134_S0000044	in the 90s searching the internet was rudimentary hit or miss often returning results that were useless and the process was very slow
YOU1000000134_S0000045	so you type in your query you did something else while you waited for it to get the results then you went back and looked at the results and most of them were completely irrelevant
YOU1000000134_S0000046	paige and brynn pushed for something better
YOU1000000134_S0000048	sergei is big interest was in taking all the pages on the world wide web and trying to make sense of it trying to find patterns
YOU1000000134_S0000049	they started to do a record of backlinks they called them
YOU1000000134_S0000051	page noticed that behind every web page there were 100s or even 1000s of other pages that linked to it
YOU1000000134_S0000053	it was a eureka moment that would change the so called information age
YOU1000000134_S0000055	then they realized that that list of backlinks could be used for ranking
YOU1000000134_S0000057	so you were better paid
YOU1000000134_S0000059	if a lot of other websites linked to a web page that probably meant users thought it was good
YOU1000000134_S0000061	so the genius was in recognizing that this kind of algorithm could give you the kind of results that mattered the most to searchers
YOU1000000134_S0000062	page and brin had their secret formula
YOU1000000134_S0000064	now it needed a name
YOU1000000134_S0000065	the guys were looking for a great name that was going to capture the grandiose vision that they had and hit upon this giant number
YOU1000000134_S0000067	one with 100 zeros after it commonly known as google g 00 g 0 l
YOU1000000134_S0000068	they discovered it was owned they said you know what let us put a friendlier spelling on it
YOU1000000134_S0000070	on september 15 1997 they registered google as a website
YOU1000000134_S0000071	and page and brin dropped out of their phd programs to focus on attracting funding for their young company
YOU1000000134_S0000072	it would not be easy investors like ram sharam were skeptical
YOU1000000134_S0000073	there were 5 search engines at the time and so i said maybe any one of them might be interested in the technology the world did not need a 6th search engine
YOU1000000134_S0000075	google just did not fit into the conventional wisdom of what a website should do which was to keep users from migrating to another page
YOU1000000134_S0000076	google did the unthinkable it helped users explore the wider web
YOU1000000134_S0000077	larry page and sergey brin had a different attitude they said we do not want a portal
YOU1000000134_S0000078	we want to get the search results to them in a split 2nd
YOU1000000134_S0000080	so one sunny morning larry and sergey were sitting on the porch of a stanford professor a friend of theirs
YOU1000000134_S0000081	and andy bechtolsheim one of the founders of sun microsystems pulls up in his sports car walks up gets about a 10 minute demo says this is fantastic this is the next big big thing
YOU1000000134_S0000082	and writes a check on the spot for $10 made out to google inc
YOU1000000134_S0000083	stephen levy is senior writer of wired magazine
YOU1000000134_S0000084	this is the way things work in silicon valley it sounds astounding that someone would just write a $10 check and get you going
YOU1000000134_S0000085	but you have to realize that there was a hidden pedigree to this
YOU1000000134_S0000086	they were at stanford their professors had done this before this is a pretty good bet we might lose $10 but we could win big there
YOU1000000134_S0000087	and at the time we had no company at all
YOU1000000134_S0000088	and in fact we could not cash the check
YOU1000000134_S0000090	this is by the way with no legal documents none of that stuff
YOU1000000134_S0000092	and even though they had the seed money they still needed much more cash no one was buying into google
YOU1000000134_S0000093	they went back to ramsharam
YOU1000000134_S0000094	they found 3 other investors and together we raised enough money to get them off the ground
YOU1000000134_S0000096	enough money was $10 including $250000 from jeff bezos of amazon com
YOU1000000134_S0000098	page and brin incorporated google on september 4th 1998 and they moved into one of those storied garages in menlo park
YOU1000000134_S0000099	they attracted the attention of 2 well known silicon valley venture capitalists michael moritz of sequoia capital and john doerr of kleiner perkins
YOU1000000134_S0000100	both wanted an exclusive deal brennan page said no deal
YOU1000000134_S0000101	they had the presence of mind at their tender age they were in their mid 20s then to say we will not take money from only one venture capitalist
YOU1000000134_S0000102	we want to assure that neither one of them has controls who want to split it
YOU1000000134_S0000103	in june of 1999 google issued its 1st press release announcing the investment $250
YOU1000000134_S0000105	brin and page now needed to hire 1st rate engineers people who would meet their exacting standards
YOU1000000134_S0000106	chris saka is a former googler
YOU1000000134_S0000107	it was one of the most intense hiring processes of any company in the world i had somewhere between 12 and 15 interviews over just a couple of days
YOU1000000134_S0000108	they created a headquarters they called the googleplex offering employee services like free food and child care and developed the informal company motto of do not be evil
YOU1000000134_S0000110	but google still was not making money
YOU1000000134_S0000111	larry would come in and i would say well how are you going to make money from this he would sort of give us a little smile and say well we will figure that out
YOU1000000134_S0000113	google co founders larry page and sergey brin had created a new search engine but had yet to find a way to turn it into profit
YOU1000000134_S0000114	they did not like the idea of using advertising to cash in
YOU1000000134_S0000115	at 1st they thought advertising was grubby commercial kind of unseemly
YOU1000000134_S0000116	their famously sparse homepage was originally designed by sergey brin
YOU1000000134_S0000117	unlike rivals yahoo and aol page and brin refused to clutter their homepage with ads
YOU1000000134_S0000118	we will not take any ads on the homepage because we think to build user trust we want to not feel like we are bogging them down with advertisements
YOU1000000134_S0000119	yet no ads at all meant no revenue
YOU1000000134_S0000120	page and brin had to accept advertising as their only option
YOU1000000134_S0000121	there were search engines in the early days which when you went to a page the 1st few things which looked just like regular search results happened to be things that the sponsors of those had paid the search engine to put there
YOU1000000134_S0000122	and they said that is not good for users i do not want the things that somebody else wants me to see i want the things that i want to see
YOU1000000134_S0000124	then they found a compromise they could live with
YOU1000000134_S0000125	they invented a new way of targeting text ads triggered by search requests
YOU1000000134_S0000126	instead of distracting pop ups or flashing ads these small ads were placed above and next to search results
YOU1000000134_S0000127	it is familiar now but revolutionary back then
YOU1000000134_S0000129	they called it google adwords
YOU1000000134_S0000130	businesses big and small could take control of their advertising dollars by purchasing ads key to certain words
YOU1000000134_S0000132	david thacker was a project manager on adwords
YOU1000000134_S0000133	advertisers love the system because they only pay when someone actually clicks on their ad
YOU1000000134_S0000134	for many advertisers it is the most efficient form of marketing they ever have
YOU1000000134_S0000135	for businesses it was the holy grail a direct connection to their best customers with a massive new revenue source google exploded
YOU1000000134_S0000136	by september of 2000 it had indexed a 10 urls and was available in 15 languages
YOU1000000134_S0000138	still with all of google is success few people outside silicon valley knew who had created it
YOU1000000134_S0000140	sergei brin went on to tell the truth
YOU1000000134_S0000142	and fooled the judges
YOU1000000134_S0000143	will 0 reil sergey brin please stand up
YOU1000000134_S0000145	but media moguls knew exactly who they were
YOU1000000134_S0000146	barry dillow is one of the 1st traditional media executives to visit cool guys
YOU1000000134_S0000147	larry is sitting there with his pda his little handheld device and he is looking down and doing his email
YOU1000000134_S0000148	and he says larry please i am talking to you can we just converse
YOU1000000134_S0000149	and he says i can do both mary della says no you can not do both choose he says i choose this
YOU1000000134_S0000151	with tremendous growth came other challenging issues for the search giant google
YOU1000000134_S0000152	the venture capitalists behind the company michael moritz and john doerr were pressuring its co founders to hire a ceo
YOU1000000134_S0000153	they were resistant but they did not want to say you know we can do it but they thought they could do it
YOU1000000134_S0000154	they went through 12 13 14 interviews
YOU1000000134_S0000155	they did not like any of the people they saw
YOU1000000134_S0000156	they visited steve jobs just to meet him because he was a hero of theirs and they said to john doerr after the meeting why can not he be our ceo
YOU1000000134_S0000157	john doar introduced page and brin to eric schmidt a businessman with an engineering background
YOU1000000134_S0000159	he is come over to run google
YOU1000000134_S0000160	yes
YOU1000000134_S0000161	so what is the idea behind that you guys could not run it yourself
YOU1000000134_S0000162	parental supervision
YOU1000000134_S0000163	to be honest
YOU1000000134_S0000164	eric is a grown up in the room i mean he is in his mid 50s not mid 30s he has got a lot of experience
YOU1000000134_S0000165	he is more of a diplomat than they are and that is needed in dealing with the traditional media world which they increasingly bumping up against
YOU1000000134_S0000167	by the end of 2001 eric schmidt was google is ceo page became president of products and brin the president of technology
YOU1000000134_S0000168	the 2 founders still shared an office
YOU1000000134_S0000169	they have a mind meld they anticipate each other is words they back each other up there is no sense of tension between them that is one of the great strengths of that company
YOU1000000134_S0000170	with eric schmidt in place google kept up its spectacular growth while its rivals slowly faded away
YOU1000000134_S0000172	the search engine linked to 30 web pages and forged a partnership with aol which brought them 340 new customers
YOU1000000134_S0000174	you had this incredibly profitable company how are you going to get it to the next level how are you going to provide the kind of capital growth that they needed
YOU1000000134_S0000176	the solution it was time for google to go public
YOU1000000134_S0000177	being unconventional they decided that they were going to hold an ipo unlike any that wall street had ever seen they were going to set the price via an auction to determine and try to extract their greatest value from the stock
YOU1000000134_S0000179	the stock price on august 19 2004 closed at just over $100 a share making the company worth more than $230
YOU1000000134_S0000180	the 2 founders became billionaires
YOU1000000134_S0000182	soon the company expanded with google maps google news and google earth
YOU1000000134_S0000184	their idealism and bold ideas had built their reputation but the company was stumbling with their free email service
YOU1000000134_S0000186	gmail was a great product that was really poorly launched
YOU1000000134_S0000187	when users saw ads pop up that were directly related to their personal emails alarms went off
YOU1000000134_S0000188	when people 1st saw these ads they were shocked because they thought how could these ads be so targeted i am reading this email about my friend is vacation to hawaii i am getting ads about hawaii is somebody snooping into my email
YOU1000000134_S0000189	the concern around gmail launched a much deeper fundamental argument about privacy and trust
YOU1000000134_S0000190	do you know how google is using all the information it collects on you
YOU1000000134_S0000191	all of the web searches that i have done for years and years all of the emails that i have done potentially information about health records information about the books that i am looking at information about where i am going because i am typing it into google maps
YOU1000000134_S0000193	in a sense they are the big brother that we have been talking about all these years
YOU1000000134_S0000195	the ultimate big brother was about to put their do not be evil philosophy to the test
YOU1000000134_S0000197	in 2006 google reached an agreement with china for access to their 40 web users
YOU1000000134_S0000199	with one condition they censor search results of banned topics
YOU1000000134_S0000201	for bryn son of russian immigrants it was a troubling decision
YOU1000000134_S0000202	at google is friday meeting sergei spoke with passion about growing up in the soviet union and how his parents literally escaped the soviet union and come to america and what that meant to him
YOU1000000134_S0000203	and that dialog happened including everybody they wanted to hear from all the employees there
YOU1000000134_S0000204	sergey swallowed hard but they all said at google this is the biggest consumer market and we have to be here
YOU1000000134_S0000206	google agreed to chinese demands
YOU1000000134_S0000207	i know there was a lot of controversy surrounding that and we had to self censor a fair amount but we were actually able to censor less and less
YOU1000000134_S0000208	and our local competitors there are also sensorless
YOU1000000134_S0000209	so i feel like our entry
YOU1000000134_S0000211	made a big difference
YOU1000000134_S0000212	but things started going downhill
YOU1000000134_S0000214	google discovered a cyber attack on their systems
YOU1000000134_S0000216	the more troubling thing to me is that we discovered the motivation which we believed to be to gain access to gmail accounts in particular for chinese human rights activists
YOU1000000134_S0000217	google pulled the plug and redirected users to an unfiltered site in hong kong that is not subject to censorship
YOU1000000134_S0000218	it is real life
YOU1000000134_S0000219	yeah this is real life
YOU1000000134_S0000221	youtube began as a place for people to share home videos it soon grew into one of the world is top search engines
YOU1000000134_S0000222	by july 2006 users were uploading 65000 videos a day and google wanted in
YOU1000000134_S0000224	they went out and acquired youtube for $1650 in google stock
YOU1000000134_S0000225	youtube founders chad hurley and steve chen were thrilled
YOU1000000134_S0000226	today we have some exciting news for you we have been acquired by google yeah thanks
YOU1000000134_S0000228	in 2006 google ceo eric schmidt acknowledged that to stay competitive the company also had to enter the world of mobile phones
YOU1000000134_S0000229	in fact a year earlier they had quietly bought another startup android a small company with software for cell phones
YOU1000000134_S0000230	there is so many more mobile phones than personal computers as people do more and more searches on mobile phones it should eventually balance out again this would be many years
YOU1000000134_S0000231	it did not take years
YOU1000000134_S0000232	apple is phenomenal success with the iphone in 2007 set a collision course between the 2 companies
YOU1000000134_S0000233	and yeah it is very exciting to be here today
YOU1000000134_S0000234	months later brennan page announced their android operating system would run on a variety of mobile phones
YOU1000000134_S0000236	their long time idol steve jobs slammed google for entering the phone business and accused them of trying to kill the iphone
YOU1000000134_S0000238	at the google developer conference in may of 2010 google is vice president of engineering tore into apple
YOU1000000134_S0000239	if google did not act we faced a draconian future
YOU1000000134_S0000240	a future where one man one company one device one carrier would be our only choice
YOU1000000134_S0000241	that is a future we do not want
YOU1000000134_S0000243	and google is battling with another giant in the tech world
YOU1000000134_S0000244	they pump up against microsoft in so many ways they have a browser chrome microsoft has internet explorer
YOU1000000134_S0000245	google also acquired companies that dealt with online versions of word processing software and spreadsheets
YOU1000000134_S0000246	things that directly go after microsoft is jugular with their office product
YOU1000000134_S0000247	microsoft fired back with its own search engine bing which debuted in spring of 2009
YOU1000000134_S0000248	can i ask what you make of bing do you like it
YOU1000000134_S0000250	i think
YOU1000000134_S0000251	you a bing user
YOU1000000134_S0000252	0 yeah no no i use all search engines out there
YOU1000000134_S0000253	i think that what bing has reminded us is that the search is a very competitive market
YOU1000000134_S0000254	bing ironically offered google protection by letting them dodge accusations of being a monopoly
YOU1000000134_S0000256	bill gates said this is the company that is closest to us as a competitor
YOU1000000134_S0000257	they are just as hungry and as ruthless you can use that word but i am as we are there is a danger they make a lot of enemies
YOU1000000134_S0000258	it is a blind spot because these 2 founders really think of themselves as noblemen
YOU1000000134_S0000259	they think that what they are doing is good for the world they have always enjoyed feeling like the underdog feeling like the evil empire was microsoft
YOU1000000134_S0000260	and now they have discovered that some people think they are the evil empire
YOU1000000134_S0000261	their own slogan do no evil was suddenly being used against them
YOU1000000134_S0000263	google is quest on the road to organize the world is information took a new turn call it a detour with an ambitious feature they called street view an attempt to photograph every neighborhood on the planet
YOU1000000134_S0000265	it would eventually include ordinary images from main street
YOU1000000134_S0000267	extraordinary views of antarctica
YOU1000000134_S0000270	many people felt their privacy had been compromised
YOU1000000134_S0000271	google acknowledged the mistake and agreed to destroy data
YOU1000000134_S0000273	the company known for search was struggling to diversify and was facing an aggressive new challenger mark zuckerberg
YOU1000000134_S0000275	facebook is 10 users spend more time on the social network posting valuable information that is invisible to google is search engine
YOU1000000134_S0000276	information that all advertisers chase
YOU1000000134_S0000277	so far google is efforts at social networking have failed but its founders are keenly aware that its users habits on the web change
YOU1000000134_S0000278	google will have to make a lot more friends
YOU1000000134_S0000280	in january 2011 in a startling silicon valley shakeup eric schmidt announced that google was simplifying its management structure
YOU1000000134_S0000281	and that larry page was ready to lead and would take over from him as ceo
YOU1000000134_S0000282	co founder sergey brin will focus on new products
YOU1000000134_S0000283	schmidt tweeted day to day adult supervision no longer needed
YOU1000000134_S0000285	in 14 years google grew from startup to technology giant hitting $50 in revenue in 2012
YOU1000000134_S0000287	in the space of a year larry page and sergey brin both got married
YOU1000000134_S0000289	page married stanford bioinformatics phd lucinda southworth in december 2007 on richard branson is island branson was also his best man
YOU1000000134_S0000291	bryn married biotech specialist anne wojcicki in the bahamas with his partner larry page standing up for him they both have 2 children
YOU1000000134_S0000293	google org its philanthropic arm has contributed over $10 to various organizations from clean energy to global health
YOU1000000134_S0000295	larry page and sergey brin have changed the way we get information
YOU1000000134_S0000296	it has been a great experience for me to see them grow over the last 12 years that i have known them i feel extremely proud of what they have accomplished
YOU1000000134_S0000297	larry and siri always had this kind of irreverence as part of their attitude which is what made them so creative it is great
YOU1000000134_S0000298	i think google attracts people who care who care about users who care about their fellow human who care about the planet and just can not sit still they built a company that absolutely changed the world
YOU1000000135_S0000000	spacex and tesla you would be hard pressed to find 2 companies that are more popular today
YOU1000000135_S0000001	and yet in the not too distant past both companies were basically unknown and were in fact simultaneously on the verge of bankruptcy
YOU1000000135_S0000002	today we will learn how elon musk did what no other american ceo had ever done before he created and then rescued 2 companies at the same time
YOU1000000135_S0000003	and brought them both to multi $10 valuations
YOU1000000135_S0000005	this video is brought to you by audible and the story presented in it is just one chapter of elon musk is awesome biography
YOU1000000135_S0000006	which you can listen to for free as part of your 30 day free trial if you register with the link in the description
YOU1000000135_S0000008	in the early 2000s elon musk achieved what any entrepreneur would dream of achieving he successfully sold his company for over a $10
YOU1000000135_S0000009	he personally received 1650 and now this is where most people would call it quits but for elon this was just the beginning
YOU1000000135_S0000010	he wanted to change the world for the better and one of his ideas was to send a greenhouse to mars
YOU1000000135_S0000011	in order to boost public interest in space exploration and hopefully increase nasa is budget
YOU1000000135_S0000012	the idea was outlandishly ambitious especially because elon wanted to spend no more than $20 on it
YOU1000000135_S0000013	now at the time sending just £500 to orbit could easily cost upwards of 30 but elon had a plan
YOU1000000135_S0000014	he traveled to russia where he tried to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles
YOU1000000135_S0000015	but the lowest price the russians gave him was $80 a piece about 50% above his budget for the rocket itself
YOU1000000135_S0000016	on the way back from moscow elon did some back of the napkin calculations
YOU1000000135_S0000017	he figured out that the raw materials used in the making of a rocket were only about 3% of the final sales price
YOU1000000135_S0000018	instantly elon knew what he had to do if he wanted to send anything to mars he would have to build himself a vertically integrated rocket company
YOU1000000135_S0000019	to that end he read several books on rocketry from the cold war and in june 2002 he incorporated space exploration technologies or spacex for short
YOU1000000135_S0000020	he then set about recruiting the right people who could make his vision a reality
YOU1000000135_S0000021	his ideal candidate was young single educated and ready to give up his social life for spacex
YOU1000000135_S0000022	elon is recruitment strategy was very straightforward
YOU1000000135_S0000023	he would basically co op anyone fitting that profile from fresh aerospace graduates to the rising stars in boeing and lockheed martin
YOU1000000135_S0000024	at 1st people thought elon was making pranks but within a year he had assembled some of the brightest engineers in america
YOU1000000135_S0000025	together they would design almost everything for spacex from the engines and rocket bodies to even the smallest details like the circuitry
YOU1000000135_S0000026	in many cases the engineers could build stronger and more lightweight components at just a fraction of the regular price
YOU1000000135_S0000027	these components would be used to build the merlin engine which in turn would power elon is 1st rocket the falcon one
YOU1000000135_S0000028	development was far from smooth of course but nevertheless progress was being made but then elon decided to up the ante
YOU1000000135_S0000029	in early 2004 he participated in the funding round of a new electric car company called tesla
YOU1000000135_S0000030	he personally invested a little over 60 and in return became the chairman of the company is board
YOU1000000135_S0000031	right off the bat elon began applying his experience from spacex at tesla
YOU1000000135_S0000032	the company is logo for example was created by the same people that made the logo for spacex
YOU1000000135_S0000033	and of course elon was quick to use the same aggressive hiring strategy he used to assemble the spacex team
YOU1000000135_S0000034	this time however instead of poaching employees from boeing he was hiring from apple
YOU1000000135_S0000035	before long the tesla team was working on their 1st electric car the tesla roadster back at spacex engineers were clocking in 60 hour work weeks
YOU1000000135_S0000036	while elon was promising very ambitious timelines
YOU1000000135_S0000037	in fact his original estimate was to launch the falcon one in november 2003 just 18 months after the company was founded
YOU1000000135_S0000038	of course that estimate got pushed back and the falcon one would not lift off until march 2006
YOU1000000135_S0000039	when it spent a total of 41 seconds in the air before crashing down violently like for spacex 2006 was a big year for tesla
YOU1000000135_S0000040	in july the tesla roadster made its 1st official appearance and recorded 100 pre orders in its 1st day
YOU1000000135_S0000041	but like with the falcon one the actual production was not going very well tesla is ceo at the time was martin eberhard
YOU1000000135_S0000042	and like elon he was promising unrealistic timeframes at 1st the idea was to deliver the roadster in early 2007
YOU1000000135_S0000043	but an escalating series of production issues pushed the release date farther and farther away
YOU1000000135_S0000044	in the end martin is mismanagement of the roadster project got him ousted from the very company he had founded leaving elon in charge of everything
YOU1000000135_S0000045	with full responsibility over both companies the stress was starting to pile up
YOU1000000135_S0000046	elon witnessed the 2nd failure of the falcon one rocket which did not complete its only 2007 flight
YOU1000000135_S0000047	at tesla elon struggled fixing the mess left behind by eberhard and in fact the roadster is production would not begin until march 2008
YOU1000000135_S0000048	but then things got worse in august elon launched his 3rd falcon one
YOU1000000135_S0000050	which never made it to orbit and then just one month later his wife publicly announced their divorce
YOU1000000135_S0000051	both of elon is companies were struggling to make a viable product and were running out of money fast
YOU1000000135_S0000052	in fact by late october tesla had only $90 left to fund the entire company salaries were being delayed and elon was faced with a choice
YOU1000000135_S0000053	he had already spent $70 on tesla and $10 on spacex
YOU1000000135_S0000054	with what little he had left elon had to choose whether to fund and secure the future of one company or to risk everything and gamble on saving both
YOU1000000135_S0000055	fate gave elon little time to think the 4th and potentially final flight of the falcon one was approaching
YOU1000000135_S0000056	on september 2008 elon got ready for his last chance to survive he stood in the spacex control center in la and waited in silence
YOU1000000135_S0000057	then the rocket took off and the center burst out an ecstatic applause spacex had finally delivered a working product
YOU1000000135_S0000058	the falcon one became the 1st privately developed rocket to go into orbit around earth but elon was not in the clear just yet
YOU1000000135_S0000059	a working product would mean nothing if the company behind it went bankrupt
YOU1000000135_S0000060	in a frantic scramble elon had to figure out funding solutions for both his companies before the end of 2008 and the timing could not have been worse
YOU1000000135_S0000061	one of the largest american banks lehman brothers had collapsed and the global economy was heading towards disaster
YOU1000000135_S0000062	in the midst of this elon was raising all the personal funds he could to save tesla he liquidated his few remaining assets and even got his cousins to pitch in
YOU1000000135_S0000063	but getting investors on board does not happen overnight and december was creeping in
YOU1000000135_S0000064	elon had managed to scrape together $20 himself another $20 from various investors and $50 from the german car company daimler
YOU1000000135_S0000065	days before christmas it seemed as if only tesla was going to make it
YOU1000000135_S0000066	but then on december 23rd elon received a very unexpected call
YOU1000000135_S0000067	nasa had awarded spacex with a $160 contract to resupply the international space station
YOU1000000135_S0000068	then on christmas eve the tesla deal went through elon had successfully saved both companies from bankruptcy
YOU1000000135_S0000069	in later interviews he would recall these final days in december in painful detail
YOU1000000135_S0000070	but i remember waking up on the sunday before christmas in 2008 and thinking like damn this is the closest i have ever gotten
YOU1000000135_S0000071	and it was looking pretty grim because at that point even though the 4th launch of spacex had succeeded we were still running out of money
YOU1000000135_S0000072	because we had 3 failures and only one success still not enough
YOU1000000135_S0000073	and then the financing round for tesla had not closed and we had only 2 days maybe 2 i think it was like 2 or 3 days maybe to close it before christmas
YOU1000000135_S0000074	so i was like man this could be a really bad end of the year maybe both companies will fail
YOU1000000135_S0000075	so regardless of the struggles elon might be facing today it is worth knowing that 10 years ago he overcame the impossible
YOU1000000135_S0000076	now this story is just a brief chapter in the journey of elon musk if you would like to read the whole thing you should check out elon musk is biography

YOU1000000135_S0000081	see you again in 2 weeks and until then stay smart
YOU1000000136_S0000001	on the night of november 12th 1944 200 young airmen set off on one of the most daring raids of the 2nd world war
YOU1000000136_S0000003	there is the target go do it
YOU1000000136_S0000005	at the time we just got on and did it
YOU1000000136_S0000007	that was our job
YOU1000000136_S0000009	70 years ago their target was lurking in a norwegian fjord deep inside the arctic circle the allies had already attacked it on 33 separate occasions
YOU1000000136_S0000011	we were beginning to think that it really was unsinkable
YOU1000000136_S0000012	they told us on board this is the strongest ship of the world and never can sink
YOU1000000136_S0000013	the target was the battleship
YOU1000000136_S0000015	hitler called it the pride of the german navy churchill named it the beast and he was willing to risk the raf is finest units 9 squadron and the dambusters to sink it
YOU1000000136_S0000017	it never occurred to us that we were in danger the chap either side of us may have been but we were not
YOU1000000136_S0000018	that day the dam busters should have been shot out of the sky
YOU1000000136_S0000020	we uncover new evidence to help explain one of the luckiest escapes of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000022	and perhaps for the final time key participants in one of the most audacious raids of world war ii tell their story
YOU1000000136_S0000024	we said to ourselves well we have sunk the beast at last
YOU1000000136_S0000026	70 years after the sinking of the battleship tirpitz historian patrick bishop is exploring the norwegian fjord that was its final resting place
YOU1000000136_S0000028	it looks like i do not know maybe one of the ship is plates you can see some riveting here so there is still little scattered sort of mementos
YOU1000000136_S0000030	of turpits flying around here today not all the time
YOU1000000136_S0000032	patrick has come to norway to find out how the raf is 9th squadron and 617 squadron the dam busters finally managed to sink the unsinkable battleship
YOU1000000136_S0000033	this day is always commemorated as tirpitz day by 617 squadron but it could be remembered in a very different fashion it could have been remembered as the day that 617 squadron was annihilated
YOU1000000136_S0000034	it is an enduring mystery why was it that they were able to get in their bomb and get away with no losses it could have gone very very differently
YOU1000000136_S0000036	70 years ago the tirpitz was the greatest single maritime threat to the allies
YOU1000000136_S0000038	at 35 miles an hour it was faster than any british battleship
YOU1000000136_S0000040	its 8 15 inch guns could fire 17 miles beyond the horizon it could sink you before you even saw it
YOU1000000136_S0000042	its armor was so thick that conventional bombs bounced off it
YOU1000000136_S0000044	an impressive giant of a ship tirpitz was built to be as nearly unsinkable as a ship could be
YOU1000000136_S0000046	when hitler launched the tirpitz on april 1st 1939 it was worldwide news teenager tony iverson was mesmerized by the flickering images
YOU1000000136_S0000048	i remember seeing in a cinema in york where i lived seeing a newsreel of this battleship this huge thing i had no idea when i saw this with my girlfriend that one day i might be linked with tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000050	tony was part of a generation who grew up with the romance of flying
YOU1000000136_S0000051	every young man in the world wanted to fly it did not hurt sometimes on a saturday night when you would come back to the local dance
YOU1000000136_S0000052	when you hoped a girl would say what have you been doing today you could say 0 well i have just been dicing with death in the heavens
YOU1000000136_S0000054	tony now 94 flew spitfires in the battle of britain he then joined the elite bomber force the dam busters
YOU1000000136_S0000056	in 1943 the dam busters 617 squadron had breached the ruhr dams using inventor barnes wallace is bouncing bomb the squadron became the raf is experts in precision bombing
YOU1000000136_S0000058	a year after the dams raid most of the squadron had moved on or had been killed in action it was time for the next generation of the best young flyers
YOU1000000136_S0000060	i was at university and i decided that the air force really was for me i made the big mistake of saying that 2 and 2 made 4 i should have said 5
YOU1000000136_S0000062	and because i said 4 i became a navigator and i was not very pleased at the time because i wanted to be a pilot
YOU1000000136_S0000063	i was a student and i was doing electrical engineering i did not want to go into the army i did not want to go into the navy and i thought the air force sounded pretty good but i was always a bit worried about my eyes because they
YOU1000000136_S0000064	they were not really as good as they should have been so i just learnt the lies the bottom line or whatever it was that they were being asked and reeled that off and passed the eye test
YOU1000000136_S0000066	within months of joining the dambusters the new crews and their lancaster bombers would be fighting in one of the most inhospitable environments of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000068	after the german occupation of norway the arctic circle became one of the key battlegrounds of the conflict
YOU1000000136_S0000069	in january 1942 hitler ordered his biggest battleship north to threaten the arctic convoys delivering essential supplies to the russians
YOU1000000136_S0000071	churchill promised stalin that he would maintain this lifeline without it the soviet war effort would collapse
YOU1000000136_S0000073	in june 1942 the largest arctic convoy of the war 35 merchant ships set sail escorted by 43 warships they were only too well aware that the tirpitz was poised to pounce
YOU1000000136_S0000075	the possibility that it is going to put to sea is enough to create what can only be described i think as panic
YOU1000000136_S0000077	the rumor caused the admiralty to issue a fatal order
YOU1000000136_S0000079	the convoy is to scatter that means that the escort this massive escort they have gathered is to return home and that these merchant men are basically on their own this is an extraordinary decision
YOU1000000136_S0000080	and of those ships that set out only 11 actually make it to port there is some not by tirpitz but by german submarines and the luftwaffe who have a field day so without firing a shot
YOU1000000136_S0000081	tirpitz had actually scored an enormous psychological victory against the allies
YOU1000000136_S0000083	this the biggest arctic convoy loss of the war provoked a furious response from winston churchill
YOU1000000136_S0000085	the destruction of this ship is the greatest event at sea at the present time no other target is comparable to it
YOU1000000136_S0000087	with royal navy ships desperately needed in the far east the british threw everything at the tirpitz including dive bombers manned torpedoes and midget submarines
YOU1000000136_S0000089	in 2 years 31 attempts failed to sink the phantom menace
YOU1000000136_S0000091	so churchill called in the dam busters to finally finish the job
YOU1000000136_S0000093	they would have just 2 months to sink the unsinkable tirpitz before the onset of the arctic winter
YOU1000000136_S0000095	if they failed the british navy in the north atlantic would be tied up until the spring
YOU1000000136_S0000097	the dambusters were to be joined by 9 squadron one of the most distinguished in the raf
YOU1000000136_S0000098	we were called to a special briefing at woodhall spa at our friend is base where their wing commander flying a man called tate
YOU1000000136_S0000099	took us into a briefing room which had been totally blacked out so we knew there was something special
YOU1000000136_S0000101	and he was a fairly dramatic man and he enjoyed having us all sit down and then suddenly drawing the cloth of a model in front of him
YOU1000000136_S0000102	which was of course the tirpitz gasp from everybody
YOU1000000136_S0000104	the beast was hiding at the northern tip of norway well out of the range of a direct attack from britain so the raf came up with a daring plan
YOU1000000136_S0000106	we were told to practice a lot of dinghy drill well dinghy drill was the procedure for getting out of an airplane if you had to land it in the sea
YOU1000000136_S0000108	they were going to attack the ship by the soviet union
YOU1000000136_S0000110	on september 11th the 2 squadrons took off on an unprecedented 3400 mile mission
YOU1000000136_S0000112	they 1st flew the 1100 miles to russia
YOU1000000136_S0000114	then after refueling and at the very limit of a lancaster is range they flew on to bomb the tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000116	in their bombays they were carrying the new barnes wallace designed £12000 tallboy
YOU1000000136_S0000118	it was a revolutionary precision weapon in the right hands it flew like a dart
YOU1000000136_S0000120	barnes wallace has designed it so it did not tumble over like a bomb might it was dropped and flew directly onto the point it was aimed at i hope
YOU1000000136_S0000121	the tallboy was beautifully designed if you can say that about a bomb it had fins at the rear so that when it fell it went into a spin that meant it was flying very accurately
YOU1000000136_S0000123	the raid would have such propaganda value that a film camera went along to record it
YOU1000000136_S0000125	after a 6 hour flight from russia the lancasters approached the target
YOU1000000136_S0000126	i could see tirpitz over the front of my lancaster and about the same time i saw all the smoke generators start up and they had about 200 plus so they filled the fjord
YOU1000000136_S0000127	very rapidly with smoke because my bomb emissary said it is no good skip i can not see anything so we just had to go
YOU1000000136_S0000129	most of the tall boys plunged harmlessly into the smoke screen but having survived this attack the tirpitz was now forced to make a fatal move
YOU1000000136_S0000130	in 1944 despite 5 years of conflict the crew of the tirpitz was largely immune to the hardships of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000132	historian patrick bishop has come to tromso is tirpitz museum located in a former german bunker
YOU1000000136_S0000134	he is exploring the daily routine on board with curator leif arneburg
YOU1000000136_S0000136	so this is like your weekly tobacco ration yeah
YOU1000000136_S0000137	but under the cardinal
YOU1000000136_S0000138	what do we got
YOU1000000136_S0000139	something different
YOU1000000136_S0000140	ah my gosh i think we all know what that is do not we
YOU1000000136_S0000142	tobacco and condoms
YOU1000000136_S0000143	
YOU1000000136_S0000144	2 staples of the seamen is equipment
YOU1000000136_S0000145	that is a cup for coffee from the ship taken out by some of the workers who were cutting the ship after the war
YOU1000000136_S0000146	so it is a nice bit of crockery that is not it it looks like they lived pretty well
YOU1000000136_S0000148	the ship had a crew of 2400 men it was so large it ran its own bakery cinema and post office it even produced its own newspaper
YOU1000000136_S0000150	was 21 years old when he 1st stepped on board the 42200 ton tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000152	we were young and we were proud and the girls looked for our nice blue uniform you understand
YOU1000000136_S0000154	german troops retreated on all fronts and starving german civilians faced daily attacks on their cities life on the tirpitz remained largely unaffected
YOU1000000136_S0000156	we had good food and clean rooms clean wash 3 days in the week we had meat
YOU1000000136_S0000157	and in the evening we have a .
YOU1000000136_S0000159	but in october 1944 as soviet forces advanced into norway the tirpitz was moved 120 miles south to germany
YOU1000000136_S0000161	it was a fatal mistake the ship was now almost within range of a direct attack
YOU1000000136_S0000163	the news encouraged churchill to pile on the pressure
YOU1000000136_S0000165	i consider that every effort should be made to attack this ship even if losses have to be incurred
YOU1000000136_S0000167	the raf went into a frenzy of activity if the lancaster bombers were completely stripped of excess weight and filled with extra fuel they might just reach their target
YOU1000000136_S0000169	our engines were changed and armor was taken out the one behind the pilot is seat was taken out there was a big piece of armor plating they had to reduce the weight so they took out the mid upper turret in its entirety
YOU1000000136_S0000170	they took the guns out of the front turret and reduced the amount of ammunition in the rear turret
YOU1000000136_S0000172	losing weight increased range but the lancasters needed to carry much more 100 octane aviation fuel to get them to tromso
YOU1000000136_S0000174	the extra fuel tanks was a wellington tank
YOU1000000136_S0000176	of 200 gallons and a mosquito tank of 50 gallons one on top of the other placed inside the fuselage where the rest bed would have been
YOU1000000136_S0000177	and it was so dangerous that ground crew had to wear plimsolls because of the danger of a spark if they wore their boots and that would probably blow up the whole aircraft at least one perhaps several more around it as well
YOU1000000136_S0000178	i have to say that despite all the fuel joints being thoroughly tight and no sign of any leakage you still could smell that 100 octane
YOU1000000136_S0000179	so it made you feel a little bit sick i suppose
YOU1000000136_S0000181	on october 29 1944 the refitted lancasters of 617 and 9 squadrons took off on a 13 hour non stop mission
YOU1000000136_S0000183	to succeed the undefended plains needed to take the tirpitz by surprise
YOU1000000136_S0000185	they crossed the norwegian coast where they knew there was a gap in enemy radar and they used neutral sweden to disguise their approach
YOU1000000136_S0000187	everything was in place to finally send the tirpitz to the bottom of the sea
YOU1000000136_S0000189	but the one thing not in their control was the weather
YOU1000000136_S0000191	just 30 seconds before bombing commenced tirpitz was covered by a blanket of low cloud
YOU1000000136_S0000193	but most people did not bomb because they could not see the tirpitz it was very disappointing all that preparation and all that hard work and all that flying
YOU1000000136_S0000194	and to arrive together at the right time over the right and then to be wasted is i will not say disheartening because we were not disheartened we were annoyed perhaps
YOU1000000136_S0000196	but after the failure of this raid there was to be no let up the crews were ordered back again
YOU1000000136_S0000198	there was no time to plan a new route and there was one more shock in store for them
YOU1000000136_S0000199	they said sorry to tell you chaps but since the last trip the germans have moved 2 squadrons of fighters to be near the tirpitz at bavaria
YOU1000000136_S0000201	in no way
YOU1000000136_S0000202	well this made us swallow a little bit
YOU1000000136_S0000203	we were a little apprehensive because of course we had not got the mid apotery but
YOU1000000136_S0000205	but new evidence has emerged that suggests the dam busters and 9 squadron were in even greater danger than they ever imagined
YOU1000000136_S0000207	in november 1944 the raf was preparing to attack the battleship tirpitz for the 3rd time in 2 months the british were still hoping to take the nazis by surprise even though they would be flying the same route
YOU1000000136_S0000209	but new evidence suggests the germans may have been expecting them
YOU1000000136_S0000211	on the norwegian island of andorra historian patrick bishop is investigating a story that the germans repositioned some of their radar before the 3rd raid
YOU1000000136_S0000213	patrick has come to the site of a wassermann radar installation the most powerful german radar of the conflict he is with local resident john ronald norheim who has brought along a photograph his father took at the end of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000215	hitler had this obsession with the idea that the allies even though they were sure normandy landings had gone ahead he still clung to this belief that there would be an allied landing in norway as well
YOU1000000136_S0000216	that was i was
YOU1000000136_S0000217	i was told that the israeli was picking up all the ship traffic going towards russia
YOU1000000136_S0000218	now if we look at this picture here we have got this landmark which is very prominent
YOU1000000136_S0000219	rocky island just behind us and you can see that in the bottom right hand corner of the picture this box structure that is on the back of the scaffolding if you like is actually the rear of the radar set so that would mean that the
YOU1000000136_S0000220	the thing is actually the vasamin is pointing inland it is not pointing out to sea where you might expect it to be
YOU1000000136_S0000221	this is very interesting because it was possible for the wasserman radar to actually pick up the raid as it came in as it honed in on tromso to bomb the tirpitz
YOU1000000136_S0000223	with the radar repositioned to track the flyers coming from inland all it needed was one phone call to the fighter squadron at bardefoss
YOU1000000136_S0000225	in just 13 minutes the fighters would be swarming around the tirpitz ready to shoot the lancasters out of the sky
YOU1000000136_S0000227	one of those crack fighter pilots at badafoss now lives halfway around the world in southern california
YOU1000000136_S0000229	kurt schultz age 92 meets with a group of veteran flyers every week
YOU1000000136_S0000231	70 years ago he would not have hesitated to shoot them down
YOU1000000136_S0000233	it is a friendship that has developed and i am so grateful for that because i was the enemy
YOU1000000136_S0000235	kurt started the war as a navigator on bombing raids over england
YOU1000000136_S0000237	but later he became a fighter pilot he was posted to a squadron of fighter aces based deep inside the arctic circle he was not prepared for their relaxed attitude to discipline
YOU1000000136_S0000239	i arrived just a few days after they had tried to kill hitler and you know the salute was like that
YOU1000000136_S0000241	all of a sudden they all walked in and instead of greeting like that they greeted like that and you know i thought gee kurt what happened to you so but it was a very loose bunch
YOU1000000136_S0000242	as far as real discipline was concerned but they were very very successful
YOU1000000136_S0000244	kurt flew 63 missions and had 3 confirmed kills some of his colleagues at bardefoss were among the highest scoring aces of the war
YOU1000000136_S0000246	he had 199 victories and i think captain doerr who was a group commander had maybe 160
YOU1000000136_S0000248	these 3 together had 600 victories almost
YOU1000000136_S0000250	as the lancasters took off in the early hours of november the 12th from the frozen coastline of northern scotland the fighters at badafos were preying on their minds
YOU1000000136_S0000252	this would be their last chance to sink the tirpitz before the onset of the arctic winter
YOU1000000136_S0000254	it was cold but when you are 20 21 you do not feel cold but it was cold if we wanted to have a pee some kind of waff
YOU1000000136_S0000255	in the mess at lossie had provided milk bottles and of course there was a huge joke about those
YOU1000000136_S0000257	looking back they just pitched us into it as it were there is the target you have got the weapon go and do it at the time we just got on and did it
YOU1000000136_S0000259	that was our job
YOU1000000136_S0000260	it was a long long journey there was no radio contact of course the only way we could navigate i could navigate anyhow was take the odd shot of whichever star was appropriate
YOU1000000136_S0000261	and just keep my fingers crossed
YOU1000000136_S0000263	at 7 a m the bombers turned east through what they still believed was a radar gap but german records show they had already been spotted
YOU1000000136_S0000264	defenseless laden with fuel and with 2.5 tons of high explosives inside their tall boy bombs they were extremely vulnerable
YOU1000000136_S0000265	we found we were flying into a gin clear sky which was perfect for our job absolutely but then one little thought came well it will suit the fighters pretty well too
YOU1000000136_S0000267	at 7.40 the lancasters began their run into the target from neutral sweden
YOU1000000136_S0000269	the tirpitz was already receiving information of confused sightings some placing bombers on a course to russia others placing them a 100 kilometers to the north
YOU1000000136_S0000271	no one alerted the badafos air base
YOU1000000136_S0000273	then at 8.09 the tirpitz on its own radar spotted the bomber force just 30 minutes away and it was coming straight at them
YOU1000000136_S0000275	the alarm finally sounded at the bardefoss fighter base at 8.18 this was more than an hour after the raiders had 1st been spotted
YOU1000000136_S0000277	6 minutes later the lancasters passed a few miles to the east of badafos on their way north
YOU1000000136_S0000279	mine thought was hope to christ the fighters do not get near us if i got a 109 off my backside there would be very little left for me finished with his cannon
YOU1000000136_S0000281	at 8.30 kurt schultz arrived at his messerschmitt 109 fighter had he taken off then he could still have caught the lancasters but kurt and his colleagues lost vital minutes getting off the ground
YOU1000000136_S0000283	for a start the planes were at the wrong end of the runway and then at the moment they were ready to take off air traffic control allowed a transport plane to land
YOU1000000136_S0000285	so they let this u 52 that was coming fly in and land down the hill and so there was another 5 minutes lost
YOU1000000136_S0000289	just before 8.30 am the lancasters began their approach to the tirpitz raf cameras were again on hand to film it all so far there was still no sign of kurt and his fighters
YOU1000000136_S0000291	it was a sunday yes i was standing on the deck then came the alarm
YOU1000000136_S0000292	and we saw the machine in south
YOU1000000136_S0000294	as the lancasters approached they were confronted by the 1st of tirpitz is formidable weaponry the ship trained its massive 15 inch guns onto the raiders each shell weighed more than a ton
YOU1000000136_S0000296	the tirpitz guns had a range of 17 miles even the big heavy guns could be elevated to reach aircraft
YOU1000000136_S0000298	it was a great unfolding orange cloud this 15 inch shell went off it would have probably taken 2 lancasters out of the sky together
YOU1000000136_S0000300	you could actually see these shells coming up they seemed to come up so slowly it was a fascinating sight you would never see anything like it again
YOU1000000136_S0000302	within a minute the rest of tirpitz is defenses opened up on the advancing bombers
YOU1000000136_S0000304	my combat station was the anti air gun
YOU1000000136_S0000305	you have to take your hat off to the german gunners they got the altitude absolutely cock on i mean we were 15200 feet and the flak was bursting exactly at that level
YOU1000000136_S0000306	but we were fortunate that they were a little bit early the flak was in front of us by a matter of a few yards
YOU1000000136_S0000307	when the fuel in a 200 gallon tank is used up that is when it becomes dangerous because should a bit of flak get through it is going to hit sort of vaporized fuel
YOU1000000136_S0000308	how do you feel i must admit you are a bit excited and think christ i hope they do not hit us
YOU1000000136_S0000309	i had to get that airplane positioned so the bomb went down to hit this target which from 15000 feet must have looked to my bomb like a dinky toy even though it was 900 feet long
YOU1000000136_S0000311	the 1st torboy was released at 8.41 it scored a direct hit
YOU1000000136_S0000313	the next 5 record in another direct hit 3 near misses and a stray
YOU1000000136_S0000315	yeah you could see it go down like a dart almost because it was painted bright green yeah and it looked quite nice actually diving down there
YOU1000000136_S0000316	it went through the speed of sound so what these poor sailors felt when one or 2 of them landed when the machine come are coming against you you have
YOU1000000136_S0000317	you cannot get air enough it is so as one pressed your air
YOU1000000136_S0000319	after the 1st wave of 6 bombers tony iverson was in the 2nd wave of 3 he attacked at 8.42
YOU1000000136_S0000320	i bombed at number 7 or number 8 and i think i had a near miss or a not so near miss i am not sure i have never i can not go further than that
YOU1000000136_S0000322	this 2nd wave scored 2 very near misses the bombs were beginning to overwhelm the ship
YOU1000000136_S0000324	the 1st bomb had landed mid ships it led to one of the magazines blowing up bomb 4 had hit close to a turret and blew it into the air bombs 5 7 9 and 14
YOU1000000136_S0000325	 had landed close by these also had a devastating effect producing shockwaves that buckled the ship is frame and caused it to start to capsize
YOU1000000136_S0000327	the 1st 9 aircraft bombed in one.5 minutes that is 90 seconds you can count 90 seconds just think of 95 ton bombs coming down at you
YOU1000000136_S0000329	9 squadron followed up dropping their tallboys into the smoke as they exploded few were certain of the outcome
YOU1000000136_S0000331	there was smoke up at the one end i suppose it was the pointed end i think
YOU1000000136_S0000332	but the rear gunner was quite convinced bloody things going on i will skip
YOU1000000136_S0000334	as the lancasters turned away from the target they knew the danger was not over yet
YOU1000000136_S0000336	we realized we had not seen any fighters which is .
YOU1000000136_S0000338	amazing amazing luck
YOU1000000136_S0000340	they were luckier than they could have imagined the 1st german fighters were less than 3 minutes away as the last bomb was dropped
YOU1000000136_S0000342	it took me approximately 10 minutes to get to tromsey from badefoss and when i arrived there the tirpitz was already turning over
YOU1000000136_S0000344	so i turned around and flew back there was nothing i could do
YOU1000000136_S0000346	the court had only just missed the defenseless lancasters all the crews returned home safely was it luck or were there other forces at work
YOU1000000136_S0000348	the sinking of the battleship tirpitz after 33 failed attempts was a remarkable feat of navigation flying and precision bombing but it had a terrible human cost
YOU1000000136_S0000350	1700 sailors were on board as the ship began to capsize
YOU1000000136_S0000352	i saw not the explosion from the hit on the ship but i feel the quake you have you are feeling that the ship make a jump from a half meter
YOU1000000136_S0000353	and in the next moment the ship began to capsize it goes so and so and at last we are hanging in the raining here
YOU1000000136_S0000354	and i go a moment later into the water yes and then i swim to the coastline and the water was oil and .
YOU1000000136_S0000356	many of the
YOU1000000136_S0000358	lay have their face in the water they were dying and i see it it was crazy it looks as when
YOU1000000136_S0000359	the footballs were swimming in the water a crazy sight
YOU1000000136_S0000361	willibald wolsing was below decks when the ship capsized
YOU1000000136_S0000363	21 year old karl heinz kersling was lucky enough to be on shore at the time of the attack
YOU1000000136_S0000365	he rushed to the rescue of the 100s of sailors trapped inside the hull
YOU1000000136_S0000367	as the tide rose the compartments began to fill with water the rescuers could hear their entombed comrades singing deutschland uber alles until the voices fell silent
YOU1000000136_S0000369	971 sailors lost their lives but the beast had been slain
YOU1000000136_S0000371	looking back it is quite remarkable that the raiders managed to get away with it when you think about it it is the defenders who have actually got the odds
YOU1000000136_S0000372	stacked in their favor you have got the squadron of crack fighters based nearby
YOU1000000136_S0000374	apparently with the specific job of looking after the tirpitz you have got the radar systems apparently pointing inwards yet there we are at the end of that morning the tirpitz is sunk
YOU1000000136_S0000375	and the attackers have got away with it virtually scot free now maybe it was just sheer good luck but i have often thought that perhaps there is another explanation for what happened
YOU1000000136_S0000377	on the island of andoya patrick is following a new lead that might explain why the german fighters were not scrambled in time
YOU1000000136_S0000379	he is meeting local resident journalist sander pettusen as a 17 year old boy schoolboy sander worked in the indoia radar base for a german officer lieutenant karl heinrich wessner
YOU1000000136_S0000381	vessner was a key link in the radar communication network on the island pettersson thinks vessner could have delayed vital information to the fighter squadron at baudouphos
YOU1000000136_S0000383	we understand that wessner had sympathy for england
YOU1000000136_S0000384	how did he let you know that that he was in sympathy with germany is enemies
YOU1000000136_S0000385	you speak very good
YOU1000000136_S0000387	that is like a cigarette case or .
YOU1000000136_S0000389	or inside the .
YOU1000000136_S0000391	wessner was in the right place at the right time but was he responsible for delaying vital information about the raid
YOU1000000136_S0000392	i think westerners have a finger to stop sending up germany planes to take lancaster
YOU1000000136_S0000393	you may be right in that wessner as you say had a hand in the affair
YOU1000000136_S0000395	to help support sander pettersen is story patrick has been looking for more evidence he is uncovered a letter in the norwegian archives written by vessner just after the war
YOU1000000136_S0000397	this really confirms this man is anti nazi credentials now according to him he actually was actively working against his own people as early as 1944
YOU1000000136_S0000398	it is not just him he has got at least 3 other colleagues who were in this conspiracy if you like with him the germans had a sabotage plan which they were going to put in place if there was indeed an allied landing and they have got quite an elaborate plan here for shooting their own officers
YOU1000000136_S0000399	and running up the white flag he goes over to the underground the norwegian resistance and they smuggle him out now if his credentials were not pucker
YOU1000000136_S0000400	i can not imagine they would do that willingly so he does actually match up to the description that were given of him by sandra
YOU1000000136_S0000402	so this new information opens the prospect of an intriguing new theory that a good german did intervene in a major operation of war on the side of the allies and had a material effect on the outcome
YOU1000000136_S0000404	on hearing the news that the beast had finally been slain churchill wrote to stalin raf bombers have sunk the tirpitz let us rejoice together
YOU1000000136_S0000406	for the young airmen of 9 and 617 squadrons there was relief that they had finally finished the job

YOU1000000136_S0000436	70 years on the raid that finally sank the tirpitz is still considered one of the outstanding achievements of aerial warfare
YOU1000000136_S0000438	i think it was very well planned very well executed and to throw those big bombs in this closed circle around and on the ship
YOU1000000136_S0000439	was an accomplishment
YOU1000000136_S0000441	yeah
YOU1000000136_S0000443	but so a 1000 germans died so that is something we have to consider too

YOU1000000137_S0000003	it is the most impressive monument of the renaissance with colonnades reminiscent of the temples of antiquity
YOU1000000137_S0000005	saint peter is is the largest church in the world yet its construction would have been impossible just a few generations before
YOU1000000137_S0000007	no one had the knowledge of mathematics physics and structural engineering needed to plan and organize such a vast project
YOU1000000137_S0000009	then in the mid 16th century artists and scholars stepped onto the stage and managed to do things that had seemed impossible for the previous 1000 years
YOU1000000137_S0000011	within just 4 generations they accrued the knowledge necessary to carry out massive projects such as saint peter is
YOU1000000137_S0000013	europe was transformed under the influence of individuals like michelangelo buonarroti men of extraordinary accomplishment and versatility who found ways to bring seemingly impossible ideas to life
YOU1000000137_S0000015	their achievements still resonate today
YOU1000000137_S0000017	but how did they do it what was the secret of an age when the world seemed to undergo a paradigm shift the age of the renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000019	rome 1547
YOU1000000137_S0000020	perhaps one man stood out above all michelangelo bionarotti project manager architect and artist on the construction site for saint peter is
YOU1000000137_S0000022	although he was in his early 70s by this time he was still driven by ambition
YOU1000000137_S0000024	michelangelo was a painter sculptor and architect a scientist iconoclast and a genius what we now refer to as a renaissance man
YOU1000000137_S0000026	one of his works would become the icon of an entire era
YOU1000000137_S0000028	michelangelo is david is perhaps the best known sculpture in art history
YOU1000000137_S0000030	men like michelangelo were the managers of an era in which art and culture knowledge and technology developed at near lightning speed
YOU1000000137_S0000032	florence 1501 michelangelo astonished his contemporaries with works that seemed to border on the miraculous
YOU1000000137_S0000033	he set out to carve david from a 12 ton block of marble a feat at which 2 sculptors before him had failed
YOU1000000137_S0000035	michelangelo became obsessed with the undertaking and spent 3 years working non stop on the 5 meter tall statue the 1st monumental sculpture of the high renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000037	from a cumbersome block of marble michelangelo is hammer and chisel revealed a human figure in the pose of a god
YOU1000000137_S0000039	the image of mankind changed in the renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000041	pope innocent iii said at the end of the 12th century that man was rottenness formed of slime and ashes a contemptible creature the medieval belief that the sinful nature of man was visible in his appearance
YOU1000000137_S0000043	during the renaissance we can see how this pessimistic view had become tiresome the idea arose that man was almost like god man was god is creation endowed with reason with strength and created in his image
YOU1000000137_S0000044	man could almost become a god
YOU1000000137_S0000046	some 10 years after he completed david michelangelo finished his figure of moses for the tomb of pope julius ii
YOU1000000137_S0000048	larger than life this moses is an angry prophet with bulging veins and a fearsome visage the way gods were depicted in the ancient world
YOU1000000137_S0000050	michelangelo may have learned from the masters of antiquity but he did not copy them
YOU1000000137_S0000052	the renaissance was more than just the rebirth of antiquity
YOU1000000137_S0000054	men like michelangelo created something new they took the techniques and art of the ancient greeks and romans and developed them further
YOU1000000137_S0000056	but you will not find a single artwork of the renaissance that simply copies an ancient one the crucial thing is that the renaissance did not just rediscover the critical spirit of the greeks for example it did not just grapple with the science and scholarship of antiquity
YOU1000000137_S0000057	it developed everything further it invented completely new things and toppled the ancient giants who had originally been its teachers
YOU1000000137_S0000059	botticelli is primavera one of the best known works of renaissance art
YOU1000000137_S0000061	raphael is school of athens glorified ancient thought

YOU1000000137_S0000064	the renaissance rediscovered perspective
YOU1000000137_S0000066	it was a quantum leap for architecture which took its inspiration from the symmetry of the great buildings of the ancient world
YOU1000000137_S0000068	the art of building huge domed structures had fallen into oblivion in the middle ages and was rediscovered in the renaissance but the renaissance did not limit itself to art
YOU1000000137_S0000070	the invention of double entry bookkeeping also meant that men of business now knew what funds they had available the surplus fortunes of the newly wealthy flowed into the pockets of the era is artists
YOU1000000137_S0000072	it was like an investment program for scholars and artists never before had so much been invented or devised in such a short period of time
YOU1000000137_S0000074	new mechanical machines were created
YOU1000000137_S0000076	and the human machine was researched in increasing detail the study of anatomy reached a peak
YOU1000000137_S0000078	the 1st pocket sized timepieces were invented this also made it possible to track the orbits of planets and the movements of celestial bodies as the heavens guided seafarers adventurers discovered new trade routes
YOU1000000137_S0000079	the known world tripled in size
YOU1000000137_S0000081	there is probably no place anywhere in the world where so much was discussed in one big conversation involving such a large number of participants where things were invented in such quick succession
YOU1000000137_S0000083	printing triggered a huge discourse that captivated large parts of the population
YOU1000000137_S0000085	elites scholars
YOU1000000137_S0000087	exchanged ideas and so invented groundbreaking new things
YOU1000000137_S0000089	but what was the impetus for this exceptional period of history
YOU1000000137_S0000091	what were the ingredients in this explosive development
YOU1000000137_S0000093	how could men like michelangelo suddenly reacquire knowledge and techniques that had been lost for centuries
YOU1000000137_S0000095	let us look back to rome in the 1st century
YOU1000000137_S0000097	back then the romans were capable of constructing buildings like saint peter is as seen in the roman forum the power center of an empire that ruled the western world
YOU1000000137_S0000099	rome exported its way of life to its father is provinces it dictated the art culture and architecture of an entire era
YOU1000000137_S0000101	at the time rome was home to a 10 people 20 times more than one of the largest cities of the renaissance london
YOU1000000137_S0000103	but rome is dominance was built on the oppression of 10s of slaves entire peoples were subjugated
YOU1000000137_S0000105	for centuries the roman military machine succeeded in holding the empire together
YOU1000000137_S0000107	but at some point the barbarians gained the upper hand the germanic tribes the goths and the vandals
YOU1000000137_S0000109	in the 5th century the western empire ceased to exist
YOU1000000137_S0000111	roma caputmundi once the capital of the world and home to a 10 people fell into decay and the dark ages began
YOU1000000137_S0000113	much of the knowledge of antiquity was lost in all areas but particularly in engineering architecture mathematics and physics
YOU1000000137_S0000115	the ruins of the ancient world were plundered for building materials
YOU1000000137_S0000117	just a few generations after rome fell no one was capable of creating anything remotely comparable
YOU1000000137_S0000119	in the year 330 the roman emperor constantine had moved his capital to the bosporus in what is now turkey naming it constantinople in his own honor
YOU1000000137_S0000121	after that the empire split into an eastern and a western half
YOU1000000137_S0000123	the eastern roman empire also known as byzantium endured until the 15th century constantinople was the 2nd rome home to more than half a 10 people who called themselves romaioi romans
YOU1000000137_S0000125	the byzantine emperors saw themselves as descendants of caesar and augustus while its patriarch was head of the orthodox christians

YOU1000000137_S0000237	that is in part evidenced by the fact that we only know the names of a handful of the artists
YOU1000000137_S0000239	although it was customary to sign individual works we often speak of the master of such and such whose name we do not even know in the renaissance we see the creators of works being named
YOU1000000137_S0000241	art became free from religious motifs and turned towards everyday life
YOU1000000137_S0000243	it also described that everyday life more accurately think of perspective painting for example art tried to reflect everyday life in great detail extremely self confident artists stepped up
YOU1000000137_S0000244	and made their demands confronting the powerful who in turn then courted them
YOU1000000137_S0000246	michelangelo for example who would even dictate certain things to the pope
YOU1000000137_S0000248	in 1347 the black death broke out in europe
YOU1000000137_S0000250	bubonic plague killed almost half the english population within just 7 months and at least a 3rd of the population of europe in the next 4 years
YOU1000000137_S0000252	10s perished
YOU1000000137_S0000254	it was the most horrific epidemic in european history and it changed everything ultimately even people themselves
YOU1000000137_S0000256	it might sound cynical but the plague did not just have a negative effect on the culture of the renaissance and the arts
YOU1000000137_S0000258	the wealth of the dead was concentrated in the hands of the survivors
YOU1000000137_S0000260	and those who survived saw life with completely different eyes
YOU1000000137_S0000262	some must have said let us enjoy our days and spend them in the best way possible
YOU1000000137_S0000264	maybe they wanted to surround themselves with beautiful art
YOU1000000137_S0000266	others would have wanted to square their accounts with god and do something for the well being of their souls like cosimo di medici who built an entire church
YOU1000000137_S0000268	the plague had a fundamental influence on people is attitude to life
YOU1000000137_S0000270	the imperative of the renaissance was live this life and enjoy it
YOU1000000137_S0000271	renaissance art was a complete departure from the art of the middle ages nude bodies everywhere beautiful people enmeshed in idyllic landscapes open eroticism
YOU1000000137_S0000273	in michelangelo is last judgment the heavenly host is shown nude in great anatomical detail it was a revolution
YOU1000000137_S0000275	the plague ravaged florence only a 5th of the city is population survived the black death
YOU1000000137_S0000277	it also changed how wealth was distributed and led to the rise of a new elite tycoons who became unimaginably rich
YOU1000000137_S0000279	families like the medici were merchants and bankers people who had been held in contempt by the feudal society of the middle ages now they were the ones in charge
YOU1000000137_S0000281	let us go back to the year 1425 and the sculptor donatello
YOU1000000137_S0000283	his patron cosimo medici was the 1st great sponsor of the arts
YOU1000000137_S0000284	medici was a wealthy banker and a shrewd strategist who employed almost mafia like methods
YOU1000000137_S0000286	he was one of the richest men of his day and his money fueled the development of art and architecture in florence
YOU1000000137_S0000288	it provided the spark that ignited the italian renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000290	but his success would never have been possible without a seemingly minor invention that revolutionized banking
YOU1000000137_S0000292	double entry bookkeeping was a simple financial instrument that involved keeping a credit account showing income and a debit account with outgoing payments
YOU1000000137_S0000293	the 1st complete double entry bookkeeping system can be traced back to 1340 in ledgers from genoa showing government income and expenditure
YOU1000000137_S0000295	double entry bookkeeping showed account holders how much capital they had on hand allowing them greater overview and control of their finances
YOU1000000137_S0000297	the medicis were global players they issued loans and signed secure credit notes for travelers that could be cashed in many countries the precursor to today is travelers checks
YOU1000000137_S0000302	on taxes donations to the needy on buildings and on art
YOU1000000137_S0000304	a host of writers scholars artists and architects were dependent on his money and they repaid him in beauty
YOU1000000137_S0000306	the medici palace is a glorious stage of renaissance art it is hard to believe that cosimo instructed the architect not to make it too magnificent as he did not want to rouse the envy of the other patrician families
YOU1000000137_S0000308	the medicis also invested in their spiritual well being they donated money for a new church the basilica di san lorenzo
YOU1000000137_S0000310	cosimo de medici supported artists careers and spawned something that had not existed before the celebrity
YOU1000000137_S0000312	this celebrity arose in a sort of intellectual hothouse in a market full of competition where humanists intellectuals creatives and artists of all kinds were supported and often very well paid by patrons
YOU1000000137_S0000314	these patrons in turn hoped these artists would bring their courts greater fame and status
YOU1000000137_S0000316	for painters and sculptors hyperbole soon became just as important as skill
YOU1000000137_S0000318	in this very competitive arena they acquired fame and status and we still know their names today
YOU1000000137_S0000320	but that also means the unrecognized artist the suffering genius was a particularly frequent phenomenon
YOU1000000137_S0000322	donatello was one of the 1st great celebrity artists of the renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000324	he was almost 60 when he came to cosimo de medici with designs for his statue of david the boy who defeated goliath
YOU1000000137_S0000326	this his most significant work was also a brave one because donatello is david was naked
YOU1000000137_S0000328	just a few generations earlier ancient statues were destroyed for showing nudity
YOU1000000137_S0000330	both medici and donatello were certainly aware of how revolutionary it was
YOU1000000137_S0000331	donatello is david was the 1st life sized sculpture of a nude since antiquity
YOU1000000137_S0000333	unlike other cultures the renaissance did not worry about depicting naked or semi naked bodies that was very significant for the development of medicine
YOU1000000137_S0000335	you can not study anatomy if you can not depict naked bodies
YOU1000000137_S0000337	that was crucial to a different way of looking at people
YOU1000000137_S0000339	a person was not just animated by the spirits and guided by the stars
YOU1000000137_S0000341	he was a mechanically functioning machine an organism
YOU1000000137_S0000343	what was also unusual was his interpretation
YOU1000000137_S0000345	donatello is david is not a muscular adult but a youth with a rather feminine appearance
YOU1000000137_S0000347	and he is fascinatingly lifelike but where did donatello get his knowledge of the human body
YOU1000000137_S0000349	with the enthusiasm of the early renaissance for all things classical interest in anatomy was growing as well
YOU1000000137_S0000351	almost all the artists sculptors and painters of the renaissance would have studied human anatomy if only from books and drawings
YOU1000000137_S0000353	there was a flourishing trade in fresh corpses it was illegal in many places and punishment for this crime was often draconian but curiosity often triumphed over fear
YOU1000000137_S0000355	di natale quite possibly dissected corpses too as did albrecht durer michelangelo and leonardo da vinci one or 2 generations later
YOU1000000137_S0000357	but even in donatello is time in the early renaissance artists were very familiar with the structure of the human body which allowed them to create new very lifelike depictions of people
YOU1000000137_S0000359	men like donatello were either artistically talented scholars or scholarly artists
YOU1000000137_S0000361	as fate would have it donatello is interpretation of the old testament hero did not achieve the same popularity as another sculpture of the renaissance one that was also created in florence
YOU1000000137_S0000363	at 5 meters tall michelangelo is david is a monumental statue
YOU1000000137_S0000365	half a century after donatello it symbolized the self confidence of the new renaissance man
YOU1000000137_S0000369	the explosive thing about the renaissance was that people became aware of their abilities and strengths in a new way
YOU1000000137_S0000371	they unleashed an incredible energy in their thinking and actions in business and technology
YOU1000000137_S0000373	there was an outpouring of self confidence
YOU1000000137_S0000375	in the middle ages nearly everyone was illiterate the few who could read and write were from wealthier families or men and women of the church
YOU1000000137_S0000377	the people who made or owned books looked after them like treasures
YOU1000000137_S0000379	a copyist might only produce 10 to 15 volumes in an entire lifetime which made the books incredibly valuable
YOU1000000137_S0000381	but that was about to change
YOU1000000137_S0000383	to obtain a lovely codex such as a bible for example you would have to slaughter an entire flock of sheep and that was expensive
YOU1000000137_S0000385	but suddenly books could be had for little money and reading became democratic
YOU1000000137_S0000387	knowledge became accessible to larger numbers of people
YOU1000000137_S0000389	more and more people were able to participate in scholarly discussions about new ideas
YOU1000000137_S0000391	that is the only way we can explain how europe became the continent of innovation more so than any other
YOU1000000137_S0000393	the scribes of the church had not just copied works they had also changed them and falsified sources claiming their interpretation as the word of god
YOU1000000137_S0000395	that gave them great power
YOU1000000137_S0000397	but the renaissance broke their monopoly on knowledge one of the most important bastions of the church
YOU1000000137_S0000399	an awareness of sources and the truth grew not least because these sources were now accessible people started analyzing them using classical techniques techniques used in antiquity
YOU1000000137_S0000401	the traditional myths propagated by the church simply were not accepted anymore
YOU1000000137_S0000403	mainz 1450 printer johannes gutenberg is invention may have been the most significant one in a 1000 years and yet we do not know what he looked like
YOU1000000137_S0000405	his achievement was to combine existing methods of reproduction and printing into a single system
YOU1000000137_S0000407	the handheld cast was the key to his printing press
YOU1000000137_S0000409	it allowed letters to be cast individually more quickly and with greater precision
YOU1000000137_S0000411	this marked the invention of modern printing
YOU1000000137_S0000413	it was also the dawn of mass communication
YOU1000000137_S0000415	information became more widely available opening the door to new opinions and perspectives
YOU1000000137_S0000417	information also became valued in new ways as the printed word took precedence over oral traditions
YOU1000000137_S0000419	printing was of truly enormous significance and gutenberg is the person who did the most important thing in a 1000 years of world history reading became increasingly widespread
YOU1000000137_S0000420	the great scientific innovations and the great religious revolution the reformation would not have been possible without printing
YOU1000000137_S0000422	the 1st 60 years after the invention of printing saw the publication of 400 different vernacular editions of the bible
YOU1000000137_S0000424	at the same time the number of lay people who could read and write grew
YOU1000000137_S0000426	more and more people now had direct and immediate access to biblical texts to the word of god
YOU1000000137_S0000429	the people of the renaissance felt close to god they felt they were becoming god like themselves they would not have said that in the middle ages it would have been considered blasphemous people referred to the bible and called themselves god is creations
YOU1000000137_S0000430	god made us in his image we are almost gods in miniature god came closer to people in the renaissance than he ever was in the middle ages
YOU1000000137_S0000432	but it was not books that made up the bulk of the printing shop is business it was flysheets and pamphlets
YOU1000000137_S0000434	they were affordable and cost a laborer 2 or 3 hours pay
YOU1000000137_S0000436	now even ordinary people could print a pamphlet and disseminate their opinions verses and drawings
YOU1000000137_S0000438	3 subjects dominated sensations and miracles religious instruction and political and military propaganda
YOU1000000137_S0000440	illustrated flysheets also carried the 1st caricatures
YOU1000000137_S0000442	they could be an invitation an opinion or a warning
YOU1000000137_S0000444	just like today is social media networks they served as a vehicle for the mass dissemination of opinion
YOU1000000137_S0000446	the renaissance had fly sheets it had literature that was printed and spread very quickly it could be printed in nuremberg tomorrow and in 2 days time would be in zurich
YOU1000000137_S0000448	information disseminated more quickly and was much harder to control too
YOU1000000137_S0000450	the censorship of the church that dictated what was right did not work anymore once the flysheets began circulating
YOU1000000137_S0000452	you can only understand the huge boom in free thinking in the renaissance if you look at the media and the flysheets in particular
YOU1000000137_S0000454	mass communication helped create that new type of individual the celebrity
YOU1000000137_S0000456	giorgio vasari who had painted the frescoes in the florence cathedral dome was also a biographer of the most dazzling personalities of his time the artists
YOU1000000137_S0000458	vasari also produced portraits of raphael and michelangelo but he was particularly taken with leonardo da vinci leonardo was unconventional and was not afraid to acknowledge his homosexuality
YOU1000000137_S0000460	he was remarkably creative and talented but also rather vain
YOU1000000137_S0000462	vasari was the 1st to coin the term renesheta renaissance
YOU1000000137_S0000464	he endowed his subjects with the aura that made them stars the shining lights of society
YOU1000000137_S0000466	he created an image of the artist that had not existed before
YOU1000000137_S0000468	most artists were craftsmen
YOU1000000137_S0000470	that is how they saw themselves and that is how others saw them but vasari created the image of the genius the strange crazy man the artist enthralled to ideas
YOU1000000137_S0000471	he painted a picture of an artist that seems strangely familiar today in fact he created the modern artist
YOU1000000137_S0000473	the painter holbein was the 1st to paint a portrait of his family
YOU1000000137_S0000475	star painters botticelli and durer even painted themselves the self portrait became the expression of a new self confidence
YOU1000000137_S0000477	and then finally raphael and titian the 1st painters to sign their paintings a further step towards celebrity the great names in art suddenly became world famous a 100 years earlier it would have been unthinkable
YOU1000000137_S0000479	the towering figures of renaissance art 1st and foremost leonardo da vinci and michelangelo were feted invited to court and paid handsomely
YOU1000000137_S0000481	in 1300 venetian glassblowers invented the convex mirror its importance is widely underestimated but compared with what had come before its reflection was bright and almost free of distortion
YOU1000000137_S0000483	most people in the middle ages had only seen their faces as blurry reflections in water
YOU1000000137_S0000485	the glass mirror meant people could really see themselves clearly for the 1st time
YOU1000000137_S0000487	maybe that is why they were more self confident than their medieval ancestors
YOU1000000137_S0000489	self confidence and pride in personal achievements were no longer seen as sinful
YOU1000000137_S0000491	humility was out of step with the times
YOU1000000137_S0000493	a person who held his head high and walked tall in the presence of god who saw reason as his special gift from god those were the new values
YOU1000000137_S0000495	as a result humility became less important as humans we are capable and god wants us to use our gifts in the world
YOU1000000137_S0000497	what was the secret of the great renaissance artists this immense flourishing of creativity remains a mystery but their charisma endures to this day
YOU1000000138_S0000001	last year was the deadliest year on record for mexico
YOU1000000138_S0000003	drug related violence has infiltrated all parts of society and all parts of the country it is affecting everyone and it is absolutely everywhere
YOU1000000138_S0000005	acapulco was somewhere at the center of some of the worst violence in the country
YOU1000000138_S0000007	our story was the influence of the crime gangs how their tentacles have spread out across the country and acapulco is a good example of it so we asked the police if we can go along on a police patrol
YOU1000000138_S0000009	well the cia is latest travel advisories for a number of areas in mexico but particularly here is do not even bother going if you are a tourist the reason for that they say is that the murder rate the danger levels are so high they are actually comparable to iraq
YOU1000000138_S0000010	and syria indeed here in one month last year over 2000 people were murdered in these drug wars
YOU1000000138_S0000012	on this patrol we arrived at a village a small town and it was a
YOU1000000138_S0000014	bizarre experience
YOU1000000138_S0000016	we came across a crime scene where less than 24 hours previously 8 people had been killed
YOU1000000138_S0000018	okay so this is
YOU1000000138_S0000020	so this is where somebody has been killed right
YOU1000000138_S0000022	so one person here
YOU1000000138_S0000024	another one here
YOU1000000138_S0000026	there was still bullet holes everywhere there was blood splatters on the floor another here another there there was all these little flowers and candles that had been left on the spots where people had died only just recently
YOU1000000138_S0000027	the last of the crime scenes is here and you can see the bullet holes from the shooting take place here that is 8 in total so this is a pretty big and organized hit
YOU1000000138_S0000029	they actually went from person to person i mean these were actual shooting individuals so not just this but actually so they were hiding
YOU1000000138_S0000031	it was pretty shocking to see their families their wives their mums their sisters really traumatized it was very very sad
YOU1000000138_S0000033	there was a lot of grief and that people were upset by what they had seen and they wanted justice
YOU1000000138_S0000035	they said this is not the 1st time this is my 2nd this is my 3rd kid they killed all my family it is just like a it is a conflict zone it is really bad you feel .
YOU1000000138_S0000037	i feel really really sad when we left
YOU1000000138_S0000039	it is a level of brutality and tragedy that is very very difficult to get your head around when you come from a society like i live in
YOU1000000138_S0000041	something like that happening sorry on hack me or it is going to be in the newspapers all over the uk and here is just a
YOU1000000138_S0000043	something little next day no one will remember
YOU1000000138_S0000045	we then decided to try and get to actually the people who make the stuff that fuels all of the problems
YOU1000000138_S0000047	we were taken up into the mountains to a modest house with a big front porch and there we were introduced to a guy who is clearly in charge he said farmers union i mean it is open to interpretation
YOU1000000138_S0000049	we did not just arrive this has been worked on for a long period of time contacts have to be made
YOU1000000138_S0000051	they do not know who you are they might think that you are undercover american drug enforcement
YOU1000000138_S0000053	by just putting ourselves in a really stupid situation where they can kill us
YOU1000000138_S0000055	these guys do not see themselves as gangsters they actually just see themselves as businessmen and farmers
YOU1000000138_S0000057	maguire charles would not admit to farming opium but he did say he farmed what he farmed to survive
YOU1000000138_S0000059	one of the 1st tales he told us when we started talking to him was about how he had been arrested but this was not an ordinary arrest 3 black hawk helicopters had turned up this does not happen for just anybody
YOU1000000138_S0000063	they may look very normal but they are involved in a very very dangerous business in many ways they were a bit like the mexican sopranos if you like
YOU1000000138_S0000065	he was very affable but there was no forgetting that this is a serious character and that this was essentially an interview but we were the ones being interviewed
YOU1000000138_S0000067	i have been having lunch with many of these farmers and they are just really lovely and nice people if they have to kill you they kill you but in other words they are good friends to each other
YOU1000000138_S0000069	he made the phone call and we were allowed to go up into the jungle where we met by security guys carrying machine guns fully kitted out with their faces with bandanas
YOU1000000138_S0000071	and they took us to the poplar quarry
YOU1000000138_S0000073	after about half an hour of really rough terrain
YOU1000000138_S0000075	we arrived into this opening it looked like the middle of the forest had just been completely opened up so that they could grow the poppies
YOU1000000138_S0000077	so this is the poppy oil that becomes opium and eventually that becomes
YOU1000000138_S0000079	yeah and all this field having this
YOU1000000138_S0000081	the weather is perfect for it and it just keeps producing so it is a brilliant crop or why would not it be the demand is so high and as long as the demand is high and we know the biggest user is the united states then it is going to keep being made
YOU1000000138_S0000083	they know what happens when you ask them you know that with this they create
YOU1000000138_S0000085	yes and you know that that creates lots of problems
YOU1000000138_S0000086	yes but .
YOU1000000138_S0000088	if they demand us avocado we grow avocado
YOU1000000138_S0000089	it seems interesting that what happens here and then what happens say in acapulco they are linked but nobody thinks about it right
YOU1000000138_S0000090	this is what we have to do we have no other option
YOU1000000138_S0000092	i remember one farmer tell me yeah i know that this is poison but if i do not create this poison my family is going to die
YOU1000000138_S0000094	speaking to them it was pretty clear that they considered there was a real threat from rival gangs coming in to take their crop
YOU1000000138_S0000095	if we do not have a gun to protect us they will kill us
YOU1000000138_S0000097	nobody really knows how much money is made by the drug cartels but it is 10s and 10s and 10s and 10s of dollars
YOU1000000138_S0000099	and it is nationwide it is absolutely every city every town every village in varying levels
YOU1000000138_S0000101	of either involvement in the drugs or involvement in crime that is actually perpetuated by this whole society where criminality is completely normal
YOU1000000138_S0000103	we went to meet a guy who is a hitman
YOU1000000138_S0000105	he explained to us in detail the hits that he is carrying out
YOU1000000138_S0000107	you have business rivals now not cartels hiring this guy to take out rivals
YOU1000000138_S0000109	if i need to fix something in my business and i think that my partner is stealing part of my money i just call this guy
YOU1000000138_S0000111	the businessmen he is working for and businesswomen as he was keen to point out will actually ask for really horrible things hands cut off heads cut off
YOU1000000138_S0000112	it is a completely different level of off the scale violence
YOU1000000138_S0000114	he interestingly saw absolutely no reason to feel any type of remorse and although he is quite pleasant and he is pleasant to us he is a very very dangerous individual
YOU1000000138_S0000116	violence throughout this society has become the norm
YOU1000000138_S0000118	it really is a mess and everybody we speak to does not see an end to it in fact they see it getting worse
YOU1000000138_S0000120	the problem is so big and so ingrained is it actually
YOU1000000138_S0000122	possible to sort out it is become part of society
YOU1000000138_S0000124	the crime levels and the sheer amount of money that is available from crime is guaranteeing that mexico is going to suffer for a very very long time
YOU1000000139_S0000001	i am yari kasparov and i would like to share with you some of my most memorable moments at the chessboard
YOU1000000139_S0000003	it is game 24 against antoni carpov the world championship match 1987 in sevilla spain i was trailing
YOU1000000139_S0000005	12 to 11 before the last game and as a world champion i had my last chance to retain the title by beating karpov in this game 24 crucial game 24 i was not rushing from the beginning i tried to play a very quiet positional game
YOU1000000139_S0000006	waiting for karpov is mistakes and the game was adjourned to be resumed the next day
YOU1000000139_S0000008	and the position that you could see now it is hard to assess i still do not know whether it is winning for white or it is draw i would say it is 50 50 white has an extra pawn as you could see but they are all pawns on the same side
YOU1000000139_S0000009	a limited number of pieces so it is very difficult to actually find any winning plan for why
YOU1000000139_S0000011	next day when i showed up at the stage i was a couple of minutes earlier i have to say that with my coaches we have been analyzing this but we could not find any decisive ideas and then i saw karpov entering the stage
YOU1000000139_S0000013	that was the crucial moment because i could look at his eyes i could look at his body and he looked doomed
YOU1000000139_S0000015	i could immediately understand that he did not believe he could defend this position and that is everything it is about your confidence that you can either win or defend and that will make all the difference for the outcome of the game
YOU1000000139_S0000016	so karpov played g 6 and i was waiting just playing some unimportant moves qc 5 qf 7 even if these moves are unimportant it adds chances that you will make a mistake and after h 4 karpov made a decisive mistake
YOU1000000139_S0000018	which is amazing because after the adjournment he had time to analyze this position home and this move it fixes the pawn structure but the problem is now white can exchange queens and because these pawns are fixed these 2 weaknesses black position will be lost
YOU1000000139_S0000019	and eventually i improved my position by threatening to exchange queens and pushed pushed and pushed and eventually won the game
YOU1000000139_S0000021	so that is one of the clearest moments where you could see the translation of your psychological weakness into serious mistakes at the chessboard
YOU1000000139_S0000023	it is another memorable moment very painful one i have to admit 1996 the final match for grand prix event rapid blitz chess that i played against vishy anand
YOU1000000139_S0000025	i think i have to emphasize it is a blitz game so it is a 5 minute chess it is not about making long term calculations this move is played by instincts
YOU1000000139_S0000027	we played 2 blitz games the 1st one i was almost losing but managed to escape and that is the last decisive game i played with black totally outplayed him as you can look at the position black has 2 pawns let me emphasize 2 extra pawns
YOU1000000139_S0000029	and total domination in the center so i do not know which move is not winning if you do not make a move you are still winning but i wanted us to exchange queens and of course you can take with a knight here and then after exchange of queens it is an endgame with 2 extra pawns
YOU1000000139_S0000030	i think that most likely anna would have resigned if i just take with a knight on e 3 but suddenly i thought you know why take with a knight if i do the same by exchanging queens by taking with queen
YOU1000000139_S0000031	the problem is that white does not have to is not forced to take the queen all of a sudden has a move queen takes g 4 and instead of having winning position black now is lost because my queen is attacked
YOU1000000139_S0000032	my rook is attacked my bishop is attacked and there is nothing i can do about it
YOU1000000139_S0000034	so that is one of the worst blunders i mean i could not see my face i could imagine this one the 100s of 100s of images showing my call it frustration
YOU1000000139_S0000036	and it cost me the victory of the final but also it is kind of a memory score so it is just it is something that is just it is sitting there
YOU1000000139_S0000037	even 20 years later i cannot look at this position without some sort of pain
YOU1000000139_S0000039	another very memorable and very painful moment
YOU1000000139_S0000041	it is the last game of my famous rematch against deep blue in 1997 because i won the 1st one in 1996 the match was a tie each side won one game with 3 draws played with black pieces
YOU1000000139_S0000042	and i missed my chances in game 4 and 5 and i was not sure when i started the game and i picked up the line that i never played before
YOU1000000139_S0000043	but that was my hope that since i never played it before and it was not part of my opening repertoire that computer would not be ready
YOU1000000139_S0000045	and i play in this position very risky to be precise bad move h 6 attacking the knight and provoke white to sacrifice a piece which is very strong it is maybe not winning but gives white a very strong initiative
YOU1000000139_S0000046	but machines do not sacrifice a piece for a pawn without having a concrete outcome inside
YOU1000000139_S0000048	so i expected that computer would go back on e 4 because this move was not in the special database prepared by the grandmaster team that worked with deep blue
YOU1000000139_S0000049	and to my horror they blew immediately to corner 6 which meant that the move was already put in
YOU1000000139_S0000051	i just could not play this game position was pretty dangerous and bad but i lost it in a few moves because i was shocked by the fact that i just made such a miscalculation
YOU1000000139_S0000053	i found out later many years later that i was right on both counts one is that machines did not play such moves it was just against machines logic and that was admitted by the deep blue team
YOU1000000139_S0000054	saying deep blue would have never made this move unless that very morning they decided to install this opening position in the opening book maybe it is the most famous game in the history of chess if you look at the sheer numbers of people who followed it
YOU1000000139_S0000055	many people believe it was a watershed moment where machines established its dominance over human players now of course the free chess app on your mobile phone today is stronger than the blue
YOU1000000139_S0000057	this is arguably the most important game in my life game 24 against anatoly karpov in our 2nd match in 1985
YOU1000000139_S0000059	i was leading 12 11 before the last game and karpov had to win to retain his title
YOU1000000139_S0000061	and as you can see he achieved a very promising position it is a wide concentration on the king side it is menacing and white has quite a few options one is just it is i should always watch f 5 as the as a breakthrough
YOU1000000139_S0000062	another one is a little more subtle to play bishop d 4 just exchanging the bishop that is one of the key defenders of black is king and if black goes e 5 then he takes now because of the attack on f 7 i have to take with the knight
YOU1000000139_S0000064	but then queen actually changes its direction attacking h 7 pawn
YOU1000000139_S0000066	so there are many options for white and it seems that black had nothing to do to improve his position
YOU1000000139_S0000068	here after long thought i found one of the most difficult moves in my life and at 1st sight it is a paradox because you do not want to put your rook in such an ugly position as e 7
YOU1000000139_S0000069	but that is something that you have to do instead of white you know pushing on the king side the game shifted to the center and the queen side and priority here is to defend the king rook here protects this pawn and neutralizes both of white threats
YOU1000000139_S0000070	and that is most important because if white initiative does not produce immediate results then eventually black can do something active
YOU1000000139_S0000072	and i remember that when i played rookie 7 and karpov came back to the chessboard from his green room instantly you could feel that he sensed that something has changed he did not like it so i actually began to gain even more confidence
YOU1000000139_S0000074	your confidence is not only good for you but somehow it transcends to your opponent and it undermines your opponent is confidence
YOU1000000139_S0000076	and the karpov made a quiet move kg one i put another rook here which is totally odd because both rooks are just standing behind the pawn on e 6 but i am just fighting against f 5 and then kd one i even play f 5
YOU1000000139_S0000077	and karpov took an ampersand i took an f 6 and then eventually i sacrificed the pawn
YOU1000000139_S0000079	game ended up with a complicated position that karpov had to force a draw but he decided to press forward because draw did not make any good to him and eventually i won the game won the match and won my title november 9 1985
YOU1000000139_S0000081	you have to make tough decisions and you have to be able to resist pressure and survive after psychological blows and losses it is more of a show of character and with some good training it is not really hard to reach a certain level
YOU1000000139_S0000082	the difficulty starts when you are trying to fight for big titles and just to climb to the top
YOU1000000140_S0000000	this parenting thing is hard man you need patience you got to have a lot of patience to deal with these kids i am not going to lie i do not have a lot of patience i am learning i am trying certain things make me mad like i do not like it when i tell my kids to do stuff and they do exactly what i say

YOU1000000143_S0000001	good evening everyone my name is kiu wong but to most people i am known as hu
YOU1000000143_S0000003	which is actually my mother is maiden name
YOU1000000143_S0000005	and the answer to my credit card security question
YOU1000000143_S0000007	but joking aside i just want to reassure everybody that i am invited here tonight
YOU1000000143_S0000009	i grew up in china who did not
YOU1000000143_S0000011	and my childhood memories are totally ruined by my childhood
YOU1000000143_S0000013	when i was in elementary school as part of the curriculum i had to work at a rice paddy right next to a quarry where they used explosives to break rocks
YOU1000000143_S0000015	and that is where i learned that light travels faster than sound
YOU1000000143_S0000017	which is almost as slow as a flying rock
YOU1000000143_S0000019	my dad was a grumpy guy but occasionally he would try to cheer me up with jokes but he does not do it right when i was 71 day he said to me hey son why is tofu
YOU1000000143_S0000020	better than centralized socialist economy
YOU1000000143_S0000022	so 5 minutes later i said why
YOU1000000143_S0000024	is that because i said so
YOU1000000143_S0000026	i came to the united states when i was 24 to study at rice university in texas
YOU1000000143_S0000028	that was not a joke
YOU1000000143_S0000030	until now
YOU1000000143_S0000032	and i was driving this used car with a lot of bumper stickers that are impossible to peel off and one of them said if you do not speak english go home
YOU1000000143_S0000034	and i did not notice it for 2 years
YOU1000000143_S0000036	and like many other immigrants we want our son to become the president of this country we are trying to make it bilingual you know chinese at home and english in the public
YOU1000000143_S0000037	which is really tough to do because many times i have to say to him in public hey listen if you do not speak english go home
YOU1000000143_S0000039	and he would say to me hey dad why do i have to learn 2 languages i said son once you become the president of the united states you are going to have to sign legislative bills in english
YOU1000000143_S0000040	i talked to debt collectors in chinese
YOU1000000143_S0000042	when i graduated from rice i decided to stay in the united states because in china i can not do the thing i do best here being ethnic
YOU1000000143_S0000044	and in order for me to become a us citizen i had to take these american history lessons where they ask us questions like who is benjamin franklin we are like 0
YOU1000000143_S0000046	the reason our convenience store gets robbed
YOU1000000143_S0000048	what is the 2nd amendment we are like 0
YOU1000000143_S0000050	the reason our convenience store gets robbed .
YOU1000000143_S0000052	what is roe versus wade we are like 02 ways of coming to the united states
YOU1000000143_S0000054	later on
YOU1000000143_S0000056	i read so much about american history that i started to harbor white guilt
YOU1000000143_S0000058	and in america they say that all men are created equal but after birth it kind of depends on the parent is income for early education and healthcare
YOU1000000143_S0000060	i read in the mass health magazine that president obama every week has 2 cardio days and 4 weight lifting days
YOU1000000143_S0000062	you see i do not have to exercise because i have health insurance
YOU1000000143_S0000064	i live in massachusetts now where we have universal health care then we elected scott brown
YOU1000000143_S0000066	talk about next messages

YOU1000000143_S0000072	i think the book is much better
YOU1000000143_S0000074	they should have gotten past brad pitt you know or even angelina jolie
YOU1000000143_S0000076	so to be honest i was really honored to be here tonight and i prepared for months for tonight is show and i showed the white house my jokes about president obama and that is when he decided not to come
YOU1000000143_S0000078	and he started to talk about immigration reforms
YOU1000000143_S0000080	take that stephen colbert
YOU1000000143_S0000082	and president obama has always been accused of being too soft but he was conducting 2 wars and they still gave him the nobel peace prize
YOU1000000143_S0000084	and he accepted it
YOU1000000143_S0000086	you can not be more badass than that
YOU1000000143_S0000088	well actually i am thinking the only way it can be more badass than that is if you take the nobel peace prize money and give it to the military
YOU1000000143_S0000090	we have many distinguished journalists here tonight whom i consider as my peers
YOU1000000143_S0000092	because i used to write for campus newspaper

YOU1000000144_S0000096	tizian pushing through ramp again it seems to make sure he has that information that will help to plant the bomb and indeed s one mple has got an awp but there are 30 seconds on the clock

YOU1000000144_S0000099	the boss with the awp and nexus got so much to worry about and s one mple knows exactly what to do takes him out
YOU1000000144_S0000100	and what an unlikely round to pick up it is not over just yet however but they have a really good chance they are simple on the awp defending already with 3 kills in this round you may have to get all 5 at this rate because
YOU1000000144_S0000102	critically wounded 4 and that is number 5 of course it is simple with the ace they started the round with 4 clocks and a deagle
YOU1000000144_S0000104	flamie watching for any kind of a catwalk push or aggression i think he spotted some some of the bodies out earlier definitely saw that one but simple is just going to eliminate everyone

YOU1000000144_S0000123	but just barely jay z walking gets back in behind the statue and they will be screaming do not peek
YOU1000000144_S0000124	play this together play the time a minute and 5 smokes off palm but will not go for it he is hoping jz walkings will perhaps think that he is
YOU1000000144_S0000125	and make a move to his detriment a simple picks up bomb he has got 56 seconds still to play it would be a one versus 5 flash over jay z checks long
YOU1000000144_S0000126	does not fully commit to the shoulder simple knows he can get closer and closer but also knows toward the door is where the other player is perfectly baited knew exactly what was going to happen
YOU1000000144_S0000127	fires at nifty is awp and jay z walks directly into it it is down to a one on one
YOU1000000144_S0000128	what a nightmare situation this could be one versus 5 simple of course it is him 30 seconds of play with it starts walking towards 8 this
YOU1000000144_S0000129	could be where it falls apart from though not going to have that much time to get to the side itself has to start running
YOU1000000144_S0000130	gets himself far enough on the side to actually guarantee that he can make it running through long a 0 nifty he is still watching b
YOU1000000144_S0000131	he has been so far removed to disadvantage now as he does look towards a i love the gap map 0 just looks away as he crosses as well
YOU1000000144_S0000132	simple considered it shoulder bait before crossing stables he is going to get the bomb down nifty knew he could not leave b
YOU1000000144_S0000133	because he knows that s one mple will play every mind game available to him
YOU1000000144_S0000134	and he is done exactly that a one versus 5 down to a one versus one bomb planted
YOU1000000144_S0000135	and simple he is holding a close enough angle that the op should not be a factor only way that is if it came up mid
YOU1000000144_S0000136	if it followed simple all the way around the map it is not nifty is going to get closer and closer simple sees it and simple capitalizes
YOU1000000144_S0000137	a one vs 5 defied map point to bail out na vi
YOU1000000144_S0000139	not even that much excitement over there i thought they would be screaming there it is smile in his face

YOU1000000147_S0000006	the coffin bay king oyster grown exclusively on a farm located within a sheltered peninsula off the australian west coast
YOU1000000147_S0000007	these wallet busting molluscs come with a hefty price tag of about $75 a pop after being grown for 6 years rather than the usual 18 months
YOU1000000147_S0000008	and each bad boy can weigh up to £2 meaning they can have up to 10 times more meat than their run of the mill cousins
YOU1000000147_S0000009	their strong aroma and complex taste have earned them the title of the oyster steak of the ocean
YOU1000000147_S0000010	but if you want to shell out and see for yourself you will have to head down to australia is ayr peninsula
YOU1000000147_S0000011	almas caviar oysters are a great appetizer but if you want to get real swanky why not throw in some caviar
YOU1000000147_S0000012	behold the almighty almas caviar which will set you back a cool $25000 for a £2.2 10
YOU1000000147_S0000013	of course the tin is made of metal which has been bathed in 24 karat gold so it is worth every penny right
YOU1000000147_S0000014	caviar is usually made from the eggs of the savruga ocetra and beluga species of sturgeon fish
YOU1000000147_S0000015	but this white caviar comes exclusively from the albino beluga sturgeon which lives in the caspian sea
YOU1000000147_S0000016	because their albinism is caused by a genetic disorder albino belugas are extremely rare nowadays
YOU1000000147_S0000017	that does not stop the filthy rich from dashing their chances of survival even more by eating their eggs anyway
YOU1000000147_S0000018	the pearl like eggs are extracted from the specimens over 100 years old and are said to boast an intense nutty creamy taste best enjoyed on toast or over ice with vodka to finish

YOU1000000147_S0000022	these are not any old birds nests but the nests of swallows or swiftlets which are made from 100% saliva
YOU1000000147_S0000023	that is right these birds make their babies homes out of their own solidified spit and some culinary connoisseurs can not get enough of the stuff
YOU1000000147_S0000024	when they are boiled in water the delicateness dissolve into a gelatinous goop which is supposedly perfect for soups yummy
YOU1000000147_S0000025	the asking price of about $100 per bowl can be attributed to how hard the nests are to get a hold of in the 1st place
YOU1000000147_S0000026	climbers must scale the dark and dizzying heights of the madai caves in malaysia to scout for nests that are ready for the picking
YOU1000000147_S0000027	ideally after one batch of eggs is hatched but before a 2nd after that each tiny feather must be individually removed by hand

YOU1000000147_S0000031	the reason for its elusiveness and desirability is that the bird can be traced back to japanese folklore of the 12th century
YOU1000000147_S0000032	where it was considered a mystical food of the elite its charcoal colored blood is also rumored to bring power and wealth upon those who consume it making it a sought after good luck charm in certain cultures

YOU1000000147_S0000034	kobe beef
YOU1000000147_S0000035	steak makes a mean main course but if you want a truly premium experience there is one kind that will do the job
YOU1000000147_S0000036	kobe beef these illustrious cuts of meat are procured from the tajima gu breed of japanese wagyu cattle which are raised in the kobe region
YOU1000000147_S0000037	the animals are so well esteemed that they live like kings they are massaged daily played classical music and even fed beer to induce their appetite
YOU1000000147_S0000038	kobe beef is renowned for its superior flavor tenderness and high amount of intermuscular fat which contributes to its melt in the mouth qualities
YOU1000000147_S0000039	all wagyu beef is rated on a marbling scale of one 12 based on this distribution of fat and kobe beef only qualifies if it scores between 10 12
YOU1000000147_S0000040	the luxury beef market has even been tainted by controversy after numerous establishments tried to pass off regular wagyu beef as kobe
YOU1000000147_S0000041	with kobe fraud rampant in the us all cuts must now be assigned a 10 digit id number so that it can be traced back to the account it came from

YOU1000000147_S0000043	so if you are a beef aficionado it is worth checking before shelling out up to $300 for a single pound of meat

YOU1000000147_S0000049	the meat comes from prized free range blanc d aquitaine cattle and is produced by parisian butcher alexandre paulmard on his family farm in northeastern france
YOU1000000147_S0000050	the extortionate price tag is thanks to the technique pomar developed in the 1990s to treat the meat
YOU1000000147_S0000051	the cattle are hand reared and free to roam the forests and grasslands of the french countryside and only 4 are killed weekly
YOU1000000147_S0000052	each cow is then slaughtered humanely to make the process as stress free as possible and to keep acidity levels at a minimum
YOU1000000147_S0000053	the meat is then stored in a room and pumped with a constant stream of air at speeds of almost 75 miles per hour
YOU1000000147_S0000054	and temperatures of -45 degrees fahrenheit where it remains in this state of forced hibernation for 15 years
YOU1000000147_S0000055	to see if it is really worth it you will have to visit pullman is store in paris very few restaurants are entrusted with the beef and pullman pays each establishment a personal visit before they are even allowed to serve it
YOU1000000147_S0000056	lob knot potatoes
YOU1000000147_S0000057	the potato is one of the most humble foods around but not when it comes to the sought after labanat variety aka the world is most expensive potato
YOU1000000147_S0000058	these spuds are so well regarded that they are even known as the caviar of the potato world
YOU1000000147_S0000059	why you ask firstly they are almost exclusively grown on the tiny island of noirmoutier off the coast of western france and only about 20 tons are produced yearly
YOU1000000147_S0000060	preparing them for sale is also an arduous process because they are too delicate to be machine harvested
YOU1000000147_S0000061	so each potato must be carefully hand picked instead with all the added effort it takes to get a hold of them you might be wondering why labanat potatoes are worth eating to begin with
YOU1000000147_S0000062	fans of the souped up spuds say the sea air and sea water which acts as a fertilizer for the soil gives the potatoes a hint of sea salt and even a suggestion of lemon
YOU1000000147_S0000063	if you fancy labanauts for tea you should probably know that they sell for about $300 per pound
YOU1000000147_S0000064	white truffles
YOU1000000147_S0000065	if there is one thing capable of elevating a dish to new layers of prestige it is truffles these fragrant fungi are some of the world is rarest delicacies
YOU1000000147_S0000066	and even the romans could not get enough attributing them with therapeutic and aphrodisiac properties
YOU1000000147_S0000067	white truffles or the diamond of the kitchen are by far the best the knobbly white mushrooms can only be harvested between october through december
YOU1000000147_S0000068	in the forest of piedmont in northern italy where they grow inches below the earth with the roots of hardwood trees which means finding them is not easy
YOU1000000147_S0000069	specially trained dogs or pigs known as trefoculteurs must scour the forest floor in search of hidden gems below the earth
YOU1000000147_S0000070	scientists have tried and failed to domesticate white truffles meaning you also will not be stumbling upon any in your local supermarket anytime soon
YOU1000000147_S0000071	these factors all contribute to the fervor surrounding truffles and the value their complex flavor can bring to risotto pasta and even foie gras just one of white truffles costs around $2000
YOU1000000147_S0000072	and in 2009 a record breaking single one.6 specimen was even auctioned for an eye watering $150000
YOU1000000147_S0000073	kopi luwak coffee
YOU1000000147_S0000074	many people enjoy an after dinner beverage and if you are entertaining guests with particularly deep pockets perhaps only kopi luwak coffee will suffice
YOU1000000147_S0000075	legend has it this highly valued coffee was 1st discovered in indonesia under dutch colonial rule
YOU1000000147_S0000076	native farmers and plantation workers were forbidden from harvesting coffee for their own use and were left to scrounge around for it
YOU1000000147_S0000077	that is when they made an unusual discovery civet cats would eat coffee cherries and poop out the seeds or coffee beans without digesting them
YOU1000000147_S0000078	after brewing coffee from the discarded beans they realized it tasted great too mostly because the civets picked only the ripest cherries
YOU1000000147_S0000079	the tradition continued and nowadays vendors of authentic kopi luwak coffee can command anywhere between $250 to 1200 per kilogram
YOU1000000147_S0000080	there are some controversies surrounding the unconventional beverage though primarily civet cats are nocturnal and do not have big appetites
YOU1000000147_S0000081	which means more than 80% of kopi luwak coffee sold in the us has never actually passed through one
YOU1000000147_S0000082	attempts to industrialize the process also means many civet cats are caged and force fed the berries round the clock which results in crappy coffee made by very crappy people
YOU1000000147_S0000083	densuke black watermelon
YOU1000000147_S0000084	after a meal as rich as the one i have just laid out a fresh fruit salad is about as much dessert as you could manage
YOU1000000147_S0000085	this will not be any old fruit though duh 1st up the densuki black watermelon
YOU1000000147_S0000086	these rare melons are exclusively grown on the northern island of hokkaido in japan in annual quantities of about 10000 units
YOU1000000147_S0000087	besides their intriguingly dark outer appearance they are said to have crisper flesh more juice and an enhanced sweetness compared to their overseas relatives
YOU1000000147_S0000088	there is a lucrative market for decorative fruit in japan so it is not uncommon for densukis to be purchased as expensive gifts
YOU1000000147_S0000089	depending on the size they usually go for upwards of $250 but in 20081 fine specimen even sold for $6100
YOU1000000147_S0000090	yubari king melon
YOU1000000147_S0000091	even the densuke is a bargain compared to japan is most highly priced melon the yubari king
YOU1000000147_S0000092	which is basically a cross between 2 cantaloupes
YOU1000000147_S0000093	this esteemed fruit is also exclusively grown on hokkaido island and is a major status symbol for anyone with enough
YOU1000000147_S0000095	spare dough to add one to their collection
YOU1000000147_S0000096	in spring 2016 supermarket owner takamura kunishi hit the headlines after he pocketed a pair of yubari kings for the eye popping price of $27240
YOU1000000147_S0000097	making them the most expensive melons ever sold but what does one of these premium fruits taste of a gold bullion apparently they just have an ultra concentrated sweetness
YOU1000000147_S0000098	kunishi said he offered such a fee for the melons to pay back the hard work of the yubari farmers
YOU1000000147_S0000099	but even a less coveted buyer can still expect to pay 1000s at auction japan is luxury fruit market is not just exclusive to melons
YOU1000000147_S0000100	and in 2019 takamaru kanishi raised eyebrows again after paying $11318 for a bunch of ruby roman grapes
YOU1000000147_S0000101	which worked out at around $370 per grape
YOU1000000147_S0000102	this rare variety is lauded for its juiciness high sugar content and low acidity 0 and did i mention they are about the size of ping pong balls thanks to years of selective breeding
YOU1000000147_S0000103	when they 1st hit the market in 2008 700 gram ruby roman bunches sold for around $910 and their prices only skyrocketed since
YOU1000000147_S0000104	donkey cheese
YOU1000000147_S0000105	a cheese course is the perfect way to complete a meal but for a banquet like this one plain old cheddar just will not cut it
YOU1000000147_S0000106	believe it or not there is such a thing as donkey cheese otherwise known as pule and it will cost you a pretty penny
YOU1000000147_S0000107	this bizarre creation is only produced by farmer slobodan simic on his rural farm in serbia with the help of some 300 donkeys from the zasavica nature reserve
YOU1000000147_S0000108	it is esteemed for its supposed healthy benefits with claims that it is high in protein calcium and omega 3 fatty acids
YOU1000000147_S0000109	getting milk from the dockies is not easy because only about 20 animals produce it at one time
YOU1000000147_S0000110	and it takes several gallons of milk to make one of cheese
YOU1000000147_S0000111	this is because their milk does not contain enough casein the characteristic that thickens it into curd to make the cheese the traditional way
YOU1000000147_S0000112	thankfully simic has a secret method to make the cheese but it comes at a price
YOU1000000147_S0000113	each kilo sells for about $1110 that is a lot to pay for literal ass cheese
YOU1000000147_S0000114	do not you think which of these premium ingredients would you most like to try let me know in the comments and thanks for watching
YOU1000000148_S0000000	hi vogue this is carla bruni and today i will be looking through my life in looks
YOU1000000148_S0000002	all right this must have been one of the 1st show i did for chanel and i have been working with karl basically until he left us last year and the funny thing about karl is that he was always so late
YOU1000000148_S0000003	that somehow i am actually wondering if he is really passed away or maybe if he is just late and he might arrive
YOU1000000148_S0000004	fashion was always going back to sources that would be a few decades earlier the hair and the makeup and also the look of the outfit still from the 80s i would say
YOU1000000148_S0000006	ah voila here is gianni versace naomi campbell and myself i am wearing a catsuit a very sort of splendid gorgeous printed catsuit and naomi is wearing i guess
YOU1000000148_S0000007	the same type of print that i am wearing but she is wearing a dress versace is style was extremely audacious you know
YOU1000000148_S0000008	it was not about being classic it was about being strong sexy and even a little transgressive
YOU1000000148_S0000009	this picture almost makes me sad thinking that gianni is gone is still a shock he was like a sort of a you know lovely father to us
YOU1000000148_S0000011	0 my god here i am as a bride at givenchy
YOU1000000148_S0000013	it is a pleasure always to be the bride in a show i do not know if they still do that today
YOU1000000148_S0000014	but at the time it was a pleasure because it was like the clothes you know the sort of the cherry on the cake and then you know everyone wants to be dressed as a bride once in a while i would look like an easter egg if i was wearing this now you know
YOU1000000148_S0000015	now it is too late but at the time it was sort of fresh and romantic right hubert de givenchy was such an incredible designer but also such a gentleman it was such a pleasure to be one of his girls you know
YOU1000000148_S0000016	next look so here it is me with miu ciaprada obviously at a fitting i always loved her brand i like what she does i like what she creates
YOU1000000148_S0000017	she is a very delicate laid back person when i was modeling we were doing hours of fittings for each designer you get to see the clothes very early
YOU1000000148_S0000018	and also you see how much work there is to make something happen and to make something become a dress or a suit or a coat
YOU1000000148_S0000019	i like this picture you know there is a rays of sun both mewcha and me are very young nice
YOU1000000148_S0000021	well this is versace again this is versace couture just after the show at the hotel ritz i think there was a dinner after this show i remember that dress
YOU1000000148_S0000022	but we used to do maybe 20 shows per season and per country so at the end of it 4 times a year there was no medium shows but there was couture shows also 0 my god
YOU1000000148_S0000023	a lot of walk fashion week was crazy it was eclectic we would run all the time sleep very little eat very little always running in a car from a show to another
YOU1000000148_S0000024	you know it was so much fun but so much work this is 1986 promoting kodak shooting in london and the dress actually has something particular you know it has pictures all over it of myself
YOU1000000148_S0000025	is not this embarrassing would you wear a dress with pictures of yourself on this is so funny really i wonder where this dress is and maybe we can get it back
YOU1000000148_S0000026	not really to wear it but just to have it also it makes me think that we used to work argentique you could not retouch it very easily so you had to do a very good light everything was about the hair and the makeup and the light
YOU1000000148_S0000027	and so we could not go back in a computer and fix it pictures was what it was and that was the nice part about it because the creative process was always going towards as much perfection as we could
YOU1000000148_S0000028	because then that was it we could not do much retouches were very hard to do okay so this is not a look it is a t shirt
YOU1000000148_S0000030	this is the cover of my 1st album i was actually wearing yes a t shirt and jeans i would say but of course this picture is from kate barry very talented french photographer
YOU1000000148_S0000031	this picture is about simplicity there is almost no makeup no hair i am laying down with my guitar there is something very pure and simple about the picture right
YOU1000000148_S0000032	i made this picture for my album as far as i could from sophisticated world because i wanted to give another message which was this is all going to be about the music
YOU1000000148_S0000033	you know i had such a strong image coming from modeling that i had to try to cut it off you know and to show something of myself that had nothing to do with makeup and with being glamorous
YOU1000000148_S0000034	you know this is not a glamorous picture but i think he helped the album to make people understand that he was a songwriter and not a model anymore
YOU1000000148_S0000037	this is the winter olympic games 2006 in torino which is the city i was born i was so honored when they asked me to hold the flag
YOU1000000148_S0000038	and i am wearing a dress designed by armani and i had to cross the whole stadium it was freezing cold and this is a dress entirely made of glass and metal you know
YOU1000000148_S0000039	so it is like a sort of material that the knives would wear in the middle age you know what i mean it is all made of metal you know there is something very metal it was very heavy
YOU1000000148_S0000040	and under this dress i was wearing like pants and shirt because it was so cold it was the winter olympic games and it was outside but so cold
YOU1000000148_S0000041	so i was actually happy to wear such a heavy dress and to be able to wear proper wool you know mountain underwear
YOU1000000148_S0000043	all right so this is michelle obama and myself i think we are in strasbourg she is one of the nicest person i have met you know in that time in that world she is a very warm person very kind
YOU1000000148_S0000044	and very bright she did something adorable during that trip she came from america so you know the usage is to give a present to the other 1st lady
YOU1000000148_S0000045	and so she offered me a guitar a gibson guitar so that was the best present you know because no one would actually think of me playing guitar when i was at the elysee palace because you know everybody sees you only like a 1st lady as if you did nothing before right
YOU1000000148_S0000046	so when i got a guitar as a present i took it as a sign you know such a cool thing to do
YOU1000000148_S0000047	when you became 1st lady how did your style have to change
YOU1000000148_S0000048	well you know i throw all the latex away no i am just kidding
YOU1000000148_S0000050	all my hot pants you know are off
YOU1000000148_S0000052	when i married my husband of course it was about also honoring france
YOU1000000148_S0000053	you know with the style i choose to wear only french designers not only to promote you know french fashion that does not really need it
YOU1000000148_S0000054	but because it gives pride to french people to have such a high standard of quality and of savoir faire 0 what a look
YOU1000000148_S0000055	so this is a video clip from jean baptiste mondino and it is a song that i made a cover of in this album i made with david foster so it is a rolling stones song called miss you
YOU1000000148_S0000056	and this was the video that i made with jean baptiste it looks very dark but it is actually a very sensual video that has sort of slow motion in it the look was a catsuit a very simple black catsuit
YOU1000000148_S0000057	the video was made by myself and a double of myself it is quite an interesting video it is a very interesting video very simple but sexy and sort of slow motion

YOU1000000148_S0000059	but i had not seen claudia for about 5 years or 6 years and just before this show we met on a beach on corsica so i am seeing this girl on the beach and i am like this is claudia so i went to see her and she said to me
YOU1000000148_S0000060	i mean we almost said it at the same time are you doing the research
YOU1000000148_S0000062	i am so happy that donatella had that idea it was so moving for us
YOU1000000148_S0000063	and so emotional really and this dress was a dress very similar to the one i wore 25 or 30 years before it was that dress but short
YOU1000000148_S0000064	2019 this is the cannes film festival and this is a dress by my friend hedi slimane for celine i like the color of the dress i like the sort of navy blue
YOU1000000148_S0000065	red carpet are a very special moment i do not do it often when i do it i think it is quite good fun this looks quite sober i would say
YOU1000000148_S0000066	compared to some of the looks you get to see in a cannes film festival which is the tradition you know so it is great it is glamorous you know the only thing i would not do on a red carpet is wearing a red dress but no one ever does that
YOU1000000148_S0000068	otherwise you disappear right
YOU1000000148_S0000070	yeah i do like adi is work i must say since the beginning i liked it even when he was designing clothing for men i would wear his costume that he designed a few years ago for christian dior men

YOU1000000149_S0000032	thank you dad for the acne tip but it is actually it was kind of nice growing up with parents that also had acne because they kind of felt my pain
YOU1000000149_S0000033	it runs in the family so i felt like i had the support system of parents that were like we get it next i am using
YOU1000000149_S0000035	it is so funny because with skincare i am very interested in it especially recently and especially since i got off accutane because i was like wait a minute

YOU1000000149_S0000052	i am like kind of addicted to lip balm and i have been for many years like i always have a lip balm on me and if i do not
YOU1000000149_S0000053	i am begging someone to let me borrow theirs which actually is not allowed anymore
YOU1000000149_S0000054	and never will be again it is crazy that i ever did that now i can retrospect that really is some food for thought it is makeup time
YOU1000000149_S0000055	i am a huge fan of a light makeup this is a tinted face oil life changing it basically acts as a super light foundation ish type of thing
YOU1000000149_S0000056	so i put a little bit on my hands i rub it and i just literally like lightly
YOU1000000149_S0000058	rub it in
YOU1000000149_S0000060	but it is like so nice and light
YOU1000000149_S0000062	i started wearing makeup probably 8th grade slash freshman year of high school because i became a cheerleader competitively
YOU1000000149_S0000063	and we had to do crazy hair and makeup and i just ended up getting kind of decent at it then
YOU1000000149_S0000064	when it came to day to day wear i never was huge into it up until recently
YOU1000000149_S0000065	let us really make sure we are looking okay here see how nice and light it is though on your skin it makes you look glowy and like it is an amazing product
YOU1000000149_S0000066	concealer i am always trying out new concealers because these under eye bags are not
YOU1000000149_S0000068	going away anytime soon they are in fact genetic
YOU1000000149_S0000069	it is funny because i am starting to see people on tiktok draw on under eye bags or under eye dark circles
YOU1000000149_S0000070	with like dark eyeshadow and i am like wait a minute under eye bags are trending now under eye circles are trending now count me in
YOU1000000149_S0000072	i like to put this in with my fingers i never i used to use a sponge but i find that it looks more dewy and natural if i use my finger
YOU1000000149_S0000074	i also like to put the excess products that are on my fingers on my eyelids it just creates like a nice light base for the things that go there next
YOU1000000149_S0000075	i use powder early in my routine because i feel like it just prevents from any creasing in my face of whatever is going on here
YOU1000000149_S0000077	let us not comment on my brush usage
YOU1000000149_S0000078	because i literally just choose whatever brush i feel like would work best for what i am doing i think setting under eyes forehead
YOU1000000149_S0000079	and chin is the most important part i have found and under my nose actually too
YOU1000000149_S0000080	so now we have a nice base
YOU1000000149_S0000081	i am having a good makeup day so let us say i have fully bad makeup days and i do my whole face makeup and i am like this just looks wrong
YOU1000000149_S0000082	but today is a good day so i am glad that you are here with me we are bronzing now
YOU1000000149_S0000084	you know just a little light dusting never hurt anybody
YOU1000000149_S0000086	hi later
YOU1000000149_S0000088	the thing i have learned is less is more and that is because you watch a tutorial and you realize
YOU1000000149_S0000089	you do not need to put the whole bottle of foundation on your hand to make your skin look good you know if anything it will look worse
YOU1000000149_S0000091	i shout out .
YOU1000000149_S0000093	okay
YOU1000000149_S0000095	sometimes i will add in like a little bit of a color like this
YOU1000000149_S0000097	into my crease but i make sure i do not overdo it because it is very easy to overdo it
YOU1000000149_S0000099	my eyes can get overpowered very easily so i always try to avoid that at all costs
YOU1000000149_S0000101	i am not a big eyeliner person
YOU1000000149_S0000102	so i like to take this kind of medium brown and maybe mix it with a little bit of this brown
YOU1000000149_S0000104	this side is just a nightmare for me trying to do my hand
YOU1000000149_S0000106	can you not
YOU1000000149_S0000108	you want to say hi to my cat what is up
YOU1000000149_S0000110	okay you are going to go back outside
YOU1000000149_S0000111	that is fun though right okay if you keep scratching on the door though you are grounded back to work being a cat mom is not easy
YOU1000000149_S0000113	take a little bit of this
YOU1000000149_S0000115	rub it in between my fingers
YOU1000000149_S0000116	i just kind of lightly tap it on my inner corner i feel like that really lightens my eyes up
YOU1000000149_S0000118	let us take a brow gel
YOU1000000149_S0000120	keep them nice and fluffy and natural looking
YOU1000000149_S0000121	then i take a little bit of tinted brow gel
YOU1000000149_S0000123	the next few steps of this routine is just out of order but that is the way i like to do it so bear with me
YOU1000000149_S0000125	i like to wipe all the excess product off my lid
YOU1000000149_S0000127	and then i take this plumping lip cream
YOU1000000149_S0000129	and i put this on and i let it sit while i do the remainder of my look so that my lips can kind of fluffen up
YOU1000000149_S0000131	i think that i could use some blush
YOU1000000149_S0000133	this is the only blush i literally own
YOU1000000149_S0000135	i hate the way you have to smile when you put on blush
YOU1000000149_S0000136	can you guys look away for a 2nd while i do this
YOU1000000149_S0000138	0 my god this eyelash curler is so gross
YOU1000000149_S0000140	but i have had it for so long it is just the only one i have ever found that i like
YOU1000000149_S0000144	alright let me have my mascara that literally is the coolest shape look at
YOU1000000149_S0000146	how fun is that
YOU1000000149_S0000148	i love the light
YOU1000000149_S0000150	twiggy look with like the crazy lower lash line
YOU1000000149_S0000152	and i really want to play into that this year 2021 is the twiggy lower lash line year
YOU1000000149_S0000154	lip liner
YOU1000000149_S0000156	i have always neglected my lips but i feel like they actually pull together a full makeup look i have recently learned the importance so here we are
YOU1000000149_S0000158	0 my god i am done what do you think
YOU1000000149_S0000160	now we need to do hair i did just go brunette
YOU1000000149_S0000162	was blonde for like 8 months and i loved every minute of it but
YOU1000000149_S0000164	my hair got extremely damaged and so just a few days ago i cut all of it off
YOU1000000149_S0000165	and dye it brown dry shampoo dap this one is really good this one has been amazing especially with brown hair it is hard to use dry shampoo because it really just shows up
YOU1000000149_S0000167	dry shampoo is also great because it adds volume like why not you know
YOU1000000149_S0000169	okay i am also somebody that is always loved to have my hair up in a ponytail or up in some way
YOU1000000149_S0000170	and now that my hair is literally this short i can not do that so i have to adapt
YOU1000000149_S0000172	the dry shampoo honestly like weirdly styles it enough to a point where i am like satisfied with it but i do like to add a little bit of hairspray
YOU1000000149_S0000174	i will just do anything for volume
YOU1000000149_S0000176	see now it looks good because i have to see my own face on the internet every single day it is made me a little bit more obsessive about how i look
YOU1000000149_S0000177	but at the same time it is just about practicing resilience and realizing that you know
YOU1000000149_S0000178	hopefully people are not following me because they care about my hair color hopefully they are following me because they want to hang out with me when i start to get 2 in my head the phone is off
YOU1000000149_S0000179	and i am playing drums i am hanging out with my one friend talking to my parents on the phone that fixes everything i think
YOU1000000149_S0000180	this is the final look i feel good about it thank you for hanging out with me i had a lot of fun with you today and see you around bye
YOU1000000150_S0000000	this is the new bentley continental gt now the old guy had a bit of a reputation for being driven by people who tended to play with these things for a living
YOU1000000150_S0000002	anyway this new one it may end up being the same because if you have got lots of money and he wants something that is really cool and stylish and fast you are going to go for this now i love the design of this car so it is just so cool
YOU1000000150_S0000003	these creases the chrome detailing the wide haunches here at the back now some people who have seen it say well i am not so sure about the rear but i love it i like the way these lights match the exhaust and it is just all kind of sleek and squat and strong
YOU1000000150_S0000004	then at the front you have got a beautiful grille this car is stunning the guy who designed this has created a masterpiece it is for me as beautiful as any constable so yeah
YOU1000000150_S0000005	i am not talking policeman i am talking art now this car is not cheap it starts from just under £160000 if you know of anyone who is looking to buy a new car click on the pop out bar in the top right hand corner of the screen or on the link below the video
YOU1000000150_S0000006	because you can refer them to carwow and if they buy a car through us we will give you a £50 amazon gift card
YOU1000000150_S0000008	as you would imagine the inside of this car is just gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous now the particular car i have got here has got almost £50000 worth of options on it and £34000 of that
YOU1000000150_S0000009	is the 1st edition specification and that is signified by this little number one with the union jack there up on the dash so it includes stuff like the mulliner pack which includes like diamond quilting the car also has the knurling on the air vents
YOU1000000150_S0000010	and on various other bits and pieces such as the little organ stops it is just feel quality i mean everything is just lovely there is a metal effect for all the switches and things like the door handles are actually solid metal i love it in here
YOU1000000150_S0000011	i really do then there is attention to detail such as the way the vents match up to this metal strip that goes all the way around the cabin i mean that is really pleasing my ocd there is something that normally would not for instance the stitching up on here
YOU1000000150_S0000012	but it does meander a bit i can forgive it though because this is hand stitched if this was done by a robot i would want it dead straight but the fact that it is slightly wonky is kind of
YOU1000000150_S0000013	let us you know that it has been done by a man obviously if it had been a japanese person they would probably been it dead straight but that is british that is what we are like in england and it is a bit like john lennon is voice the fact that it is imperfect is what makes it so perfect
YOU1000000150_S0000014	and the leather quality throughout is just lush it has got a boutique tailored feel to it there are a few things i am not so sure about though so you have got digital dials in this car and
YOU1000000150_S0000015	they are really functional and i like what they have done with them they look almost real the way they have got like a 3 d effect part of me just wants old fashioned analog dials
YOU1000000150_S0000016	but there is greater functionality with this so you can do things like look at the sat nav make it go widescreen connect your phone look through various functions and
YOU1000000150_S0000017	it is all good and there is the widescreen infotainment display which is okay to use you can tell it is based on the system used by audi for some reason they have tried to personalize it make it a bit more bentley but it is
YOU1000000150_S0000018	it is not as easy to use
YOU1000000150_S0000019	these switches on the steering wheel are a bit like those you get in a golf now journalists may complain about that but the fact is someone who buys this car has never been anywhere near a golf nor their friends the only golf they know is played at saint andrews or pebble beach
YOU1000000150_S0000020	so it is functional it works it does not really matter and it does not feel cheap in fact all the switches with the metal effect like i say it is just gosh it is lovely some of the switches down here they are nicely laid out but they can be a bit confusing to use when you are driving but you can feel your way round them okay
YOU1000000150_S0000021	and there is a decent amount of storage in here so we have got huge door bins which is handy for your bottle of water down here there is a special storage area which i imagine could be used for your cigars but i do not have any cubans so i am having to use .
YOU1000000150_S0000023	to illustrate that there is a bit of storage in here but the glove box is not the largest but it is okay you can put your expensive leather gloves in there there is a bit more storage under there and this car actually has a wireless charging point for your mobile phone
YOU1000000150_S0000024	and then under here there is some really deep cup holders i mean look at that look at the way that opens i mean the quality in here is just impeccable all the wood just feels great and even the speaker covers for this upgraded name audio system which
YOU1000000150_S0000025	by the way is so loud the bass is thumping it is almost like thunder it is so good that feels glorious everything you touch and feel is glorious however what is it like for people in the back this is supposed to be a 4 seater coupe
YOU1000000150_S0000026	so come on yes that will slide out the way good should not have to do anything manually in this bentley also the door
YOU1000000150_S0000027	there you go it is soft closing it has got this little seat belt butler there so you do not have to reach for your own belt now i am just going to put this seat back i have never been in the rear of this car before let us see what it is like is it going to crush my legs
YOU1000000150_S0000029	i have got enough knee room the foot space is a bit tight and the seat is rather deep so it is pressing against my calf so it is not the most comfy back here and headroom is tight as well though my head is touching this beautiful leather roof lining
YOU1000000150_S0000030	i have got product in my hair so it is going to end up leaving stain on there these seats are gorgeous you have got your own rear windows as well which is nice that is a bit of fresh air in there is some storage and cup holders under here you have got 12 volt socket you have got
YOU1000000150_S0000031	charging point for your mobile phone you have even got some through loading if you want to carry skis in the back look at this it is a bit unusual i have never had that before normally this would be hinged but yes i could probably sell that on ebay for about £500 now let us check out
YOU1000000150_S0000032	the boot because yeah this is quite a big car but i do not reckon it has got the biggest boot i think you know it is a sporty coupe
YOU1000000150_S0000034	but it is decent enough in size you can fit a large suitcase and there is a bit of a lip to lift stuff over but to stop you scratching your paintwork there is a scuff plate here i think it might be plastic but it looks like metal and i will forgive it because quality in the boot here is really good
YOU1000000150_S0000035	boot even the carpets here are thick almost as thick as in the front and check this out for the 12 v socket look at that it is damped now the thing with this boot is that they have designed it to be wide enough to take
YOU1000000150_S0000037	it is just a golf clubs look golf clubs
YOU1000000150_S0000039	fit quite easily
YOU1000000150_S0000040	however this car is not all perfect here is 5 annoying things about it
YOU1000000150_S0000042	this steering wheel looks super lovely and i really like the large bentley logo seems posh shame then that they have to write airbag so big beneath it airbag
YOU1000000150_S0000043	the surrounds for these parking sensors just look awful they do not even fit properly for some reason you can not get the bentley continental gt with android auto what is that because android phones are not as good as iphones i think not because the new galaxy
YOU1000000150_S0000044	s 9 is definitely better than an iphone x discuss in the comments box below
YOU1000000150_S0000045	when you are driving the light reflects in this shiny strip and it catches the corner of your eye and you always think there is another vehicle just in your blind spot do not worry there is still plenty to like about this car here is the carwow 5 cool features the head up display is really big
YOU1000000150_S0000046	and bright and very useful while you are driving you can show things like the direction from the satellite navigation your speed and the actual speed limit when you put the rear spoiler up manually it shows that you have done that on a little graphic on the car is display which is kind of cool
YOU1000000150_S0000047	i absolutely love the look of the lights they have been designed to look like diamonds maybe they are just swarovski crystals that is a bit easy definitely diamonds digital display a little bit too modern for you
YOU1000000150_S0000048	do not worry you can turn back time by rotating the screen around for some analog dials and then when you turn the car off it will all just flip away
YOU1000000150_S0000050	and reveal a nice clean wooden surface
YOU1000000150_S0000051	now it is time to hit the road to see what this car is like to drive
YOU1000000150_S0000053	how fast can a car which weighs 2.2 tons actually be well we are going to find out because i have got some special timing equipment up there i am going to launch this bentley
YOU1000000150_S0000055	crikey
YOU1000000150_S0000057	this is nuts this is very very very very fast
YOU1000000150_S0000059	whoa wow
YOU1000000150_S0000061	i have got to hand it to the brakes 1st of all i mean they slammed on the anchors that is good news the brakes are good but what about the performance
YOU1000000150_S0000063	0 60 mph in 3.7 seconds
YOU1000000150_S0000065	so why is this car so blumming quick well because underneath the bonnet is a 6 liter w 12 twin turbocharged petrol engine with
YOU1000000150_S0000066	635 horsepower and 900 newton meters of torque
YOU1000000150_S0000067	and i love this engine it is so powerful there is something almost geological to it in the way that it is relentless and it makes the noise
YOU1000000150_S0000069	of an erupting volcano now there is a small matter of economy in emissions which is not great but i am averaging 22 mpg
YOU1000000150_S0000070	now that could be quite expensive but if you can afford this car you do not care about that what is more important is how far you can go between fuel stops and this car has a big petrol tank so with that economy
YOU1000000150_S0000072	i could go about 450 miles between having to pull up and rub shoulders with normal people at a petrol station i can twist the dial down here and put everything in comfort mode and it softens off the air suspension
YOU1000000150_S0000073	and then the throttle response makes the steering a bit lighter the best mode is the special bentley mode which is the best of both worlds between sportiness and comfort and yeah you chuck it into a corner
YOU1000000150_S0000074	it somehow grips and goes round for instance i am on a twisty road now and
YOU1000000150_S0000076	it is surprisingly good you see this new continental gt seems to just continue just holding its line whereas the old one would have kind of just run out of talent and started to wobble off the road it is genuinely good fun when you get the opportunity
YOU1000000150_S0000077	to throw it a power pit
YOU1000000150_S0000079	that is a bit wrong doing this it is a bit like driving the british museum really fast down a road
YOU1000000150_S0000081	you can do with total confidence the 4 wheel drive system grips and grips and grips
YOU1000000150_S0000083	and it can send loads of power to the back i mean it is rear drive biased so it feels sporty
YOU1000000150_S0000084	i mean yeah it is not quite as agile as something like a ferrari gtc 4 lusso but i think it is nicer inside i could live like this what a car actually i have got to be critical
YOU1000000150_S0000085	there is something i do not like about the driving experience and that is the rear visibility which is kind of letterbox like that is the best way to describe it is there anything else i do not like
YOU1000000150_S0000087	now if you click on the pop out bar in the top right hand corner of the screen or the link below the video you can go to carwow com to see how much you can save on a new car so then what is my final verdict on the bentley continental gt should you avoid it should you consider it should you shortlist it
YOU1000000150_S0000088	or should you just go right ahead and buy it well if i won the lottery or if i was a football player i would buy it i love this car i really do

YOU1000000150_S0000092	now did you spot the easter egg in this video it was the continental chocolate in the car is glove box
YOU1000000151_S0000001	the fr s and its sisters have gotten a lot of attention as the affordable enthusiast rear wheel drive car the de facto standard however the british pioneered this idea and the japanese refined it so we brought along
YOU1000000151_S0000003	2000 and a mazda rx 8 to find out if the fr s truly is the best example
YOU1000000151_S0000004	and these are the 2 that you have asked for i mean we have had so many requests
YOU1000000151_S0000006	and i am excited to do it but i have a little concern i may have dug myself a hole
YOU1000000151_S0000007	well so what is wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000008	well on the pch piece i may have said that the frs was better than the pch
YOU1000000151_S0000010	i think you did say that
YOU1000000151_S0000011	i think i did too i think i remember that so now i am prepared to be wrong we have them here i am prepared to drive them i am prepared to be wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000012	i think i am going to be wrong too i think i .
YOU1000000151_S0000013	well actually you know what no matter how this goes the fanboys for these cars are so serious
YOU1000000151_S0000014	well that is true this is the wrong review these are the wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000016	so whatever we say .
YOU1000000151_S0000018	this is about the only time you are going to see all 3 of these cars unbiased by non owners together that is why we are here you have asked for it so let us go be wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000020	so here is the same white fr s we had on our pacific coast highway shoot
YOU1000000151_S0000022	it is one of the 1st 86 fr s that were in the country and i just like this car
YOU1000000151_S0000023	it is always nice to get back in a car that you remembered loving and it did not let you down
YOU1000000151_S0000025	the fr s is not disappointing me personally i feel like the brz is the better setup however and i am getting back to the fr s thinking i loved it but we were comparing against different cars
YOU1000000151_S0000026	the 2 cars we brought along with it pretty steep competition
YOU1000000151_S0000028	last time we drove the rx 8 for the show it was an 4 this is a 2011 in fact it is the last rx 8 r 3 sold in southern california and i maintain that everything about this car is just odd
YOU1000000151_S0000029	just kind of off kilter unique this 2nd generation rx 8 is definitely more refined than the 1st generation
YOU1000000151_S0000030	after having driven the 1st generation rx 8 i feel like that car was more willing just slightly more willing than this car but what i do not feel like they have done is completely take away that fun to drive that just
YOU1000000151_S0000031	brilliant enthusiasm so this car represents the most sorted best example of the rx 8
YOU1000000151_S0000033	of course there is 2 versions of the honda s 2000 and they are much debated the ap one and the ap 2 this is an ap 2 if you want to go with the ap one version with a higher redline and a little bit more tail happy suspension
YOU1000000151_S0000034	then you can get them cheaper but in this ap 2 they definitely refined the car and of course you are buying one of the most reliable cars ever made the guy that owns this has got almost 80000 miles on it and has never done anything more than standard maintenance
YOU1000000151_S0000035	what is great is you have got that nearly bulletproof nature of honda cars so you do not have to worry about beating on this thing now the car we are driving today is the car we drove in our standalone honda s 2000 review so driving it later
YOU1000000151_S0000036	it has got of course more miles and it still feels fresh i am sad to say these cars are no longer the market and it is also a tragedy that honda is building things like the honda panamera i mean the honda crosstour
YOU1000000151_S0000038	getting right out of the other cars into the fr s is truly revealing i was not thinking that the fr s needed more power i thought it was fine
YOU1000000151_S0000040	i am wrong about that in spite of being the least powerful the fr s is actually the easiest to launch but it also runs out of breath the fastest i mean above about 5000 rpms if you put your foot to the floor .
YOU1000000151_S0000041	you expect that extra little surge when you mat the gas and it just does not happen here i am stepping on the throttle and i feel like the fr s is holding something back
YOU1000000151_S0000043	and that feeling is not that it is holding something back it just does not have any more to give
YOU1000000151_S0000045	now this s 2000 has the 40 more horsepower that we wish we had in the fr s
YOU1000000151_S0000047	but it has almost the exact same torque
YOU1000000151_S0000049	so because of the much loved honda vtec engine you have got to reverend it pretty high to find the power in this car
YOU1000000151_S0000050	there is enough there i am not wanting for power and as hard as you can reverend the engine it is just a constant surge
YOU1000000151_S0000052	and you feel that vtec changeover right about 6000 rpms and it gives you that extra little kick in the ass when the fr s is just dying away the s 2000 is a 2nd faster 0 60 than the fr s
YOU1000000151_S0000053	i mean that is pretty much the only stat you need to know to remind you that the fr s is just underpowered
YOU1000000151_S0000055	the rx 8 also has the missing ingredient the fr s does not more power
YOU1000000151_S0000056	and this engine in spite of the fact that it is atypical in spite of the fact that its reputation is not all that reliable it is so silky smooth it feels like somehow this engine is better lubricated and better built than anything you have ever driven
YOU1000000151_S0000057	there is no vibration it just sings up through the rpm headed toward its 9000 rpm redline however even though the rx 8 is more powerful than the fr s it does not actually feel like it
YOU1000000151_S0000058	it is not really any faster and like the fr s it never gives me as much as i expect
YOU1000000151_S0000060	the rx 8 makes great power you are just going to not think that it does anywhere below 5000 rpm
YOU1000000151_S0000062	you have got to grab this car by the scruff of the neck smack it around and make it your bitch otherwise you are not going to be smiling once you do you will be happy
YOU1000000151_S0000064	now i will acknowledge that for every person you hear about who has gone 150000 miles on their 1st rotary engine there is the guy next to him with an rx 8 that is done 3 engines in 150000 miles the big trick is these engines burn a lot of gas
YOU1000000151_S0000065	and they burn a lot of oil just during the hard driving of this shoot we have burned almost a half quart of oil
YOU1000000151_S0000067	now what is interesting about all 3 of these cars is they have got electric power steering
YOU1000000151_S0000068	for all the complaints that are happening right now for poor electric steering racks in cars each of these 3 cars have electric power steering and all of them get it right
YOU1000000151_S0000069	so if you have associated electric power steering with something that does not feel right when you are driving a field goer or have good steering feedback you are completely wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000071	now the steering on the rx 8 does not feel quite as sharp but what is nice is the harder you push this car the better it gets
YOU1000000151_S0000072	if you compare the rx 8 is steering to most cars it is probably going to win it is a very informative steering rack but it feels larger and more disconnected than the other 2 cars
YOU1000000151_S0000074	if you think the handling on the rx 8 is numb you ought to have your head examined i would say the steering feels slightly muted but it does not feel numb
YOU1000000151_S0000076	this is so strange i can feel the longer wheelbase but it plants itself so well
YOU1000000151_S0000078	now this r 3 makes it far more aggressive it has got a stiffer suspension and in fact this car has the longest wheelbase but the worst ride on the highway it just kind of vibrates and pops as you go along at normal highway speeds
YOU1000000151_S0000080	even in this company the fr s is an incredibly easy car to drive very fast now of course it can not get up to speed as fast but once you are there this can hang on to speed in corners almost better than the other 2
YOU1000000151_S0000081	with a better set of tires i think you can outgrip them both but the great thing is this just tells you so much about what is going on that it gives you a lot of confidence partially because the limits in the fr s are low enough that you can approach them safely and you can feel them coming
YOU1000000151_S0000083	in some ways the fr s is like having a really good navigator they are telling you information all the time and the faster you drive the more their information just increases
YOU1000000151_S0000084	i really do love the flickability of this car it really does seem like it is on an edge
YOU1000000151_S0000086	the chassis dynamics are good because of that low center of gravity because of where that engine is at but to turn the fr s from really really good into great it needs more power
YOU1000000151_S0000087	i was wrong
YOU1000000151_S0000089	it is good
YOU1000000151_S0000091	but it is not the honda s 2000
YOU1000000151_S0000093	there is 0 body roll in this car i mean short of like the corvette zr one we drove this has got the least body roll i have ever felt and of course the s 2000 brags a 50 50 weight distribution and it weighs what the fr s weighs
YOU1000000151_S0000095	this car is handling is unbelievably sharp and what i love is you can just roll onto the throttle and push it harder and harder
YOU1000000151_S0000097	through the corner just like you do a motorcycle the harder you roll onto the throttle the more it settles the car
YOU1000000151_S0000098	the fr s has a little bit better initial turn in because the steering rack is tighter but the s 2000 seems to link the corner more consistently than the fr s it gets a little bit of slide a little bit of scrub going on and the s 2000 just clings and hangs on
YOU1000000151_S0000100	getting back in the frs is like looking up your high school sweetheart on facebook and
YOU1000000151_S0000102	finding out that she is
YOU1000000151_S0000104	almost as good as you remember her but here is the thing about the fr s this is version one
YOU1000000151_S0000106	designed this car and made it specifically with the thinking in mind that
YOU1000000151_S0000107	people would be adding to it however i want this car to be just that much better it is so good why can not it be right
YOU1000000151_S0000108	i really do love this car i step away for a while and i think it really probably was not that good and i come back and i realize you know what the fr s is overhyped but the accolades it is gotten are completely deserved
YOU1000000151_S0000109	this is a really impressive car it is a rewarding and fun to drive car and how rarely is that available at 25 grand new
YOU1000000151_S0000111	this has all the refinement and the fine tuning that the fr s just has not gotten yet i expect that it will but this rx 8 is about as great as this car is going to get and it feels very refined
YOU1000000151_S0000112	i remember liking the 1st generation rx 8 it was very willing and i love this car even more
YOU1000000151_S0000113	the thing about the rx 8 for me is that i am very impressed i respect it i just can not fall in love with it
YOU1000000151_S0000115	it is like meeting a friend of yours girlfriend and you recognize that she is hot but for whatever reason she just does not do anything for you
YOU1000000151_S0000117	i have got to listen to my heart i have got to listen to the car that made me grin as soon as i got in it again you are looking for the most pure the clearest driving experience
YOU1000000151_S0000118	for enthusiasts it is the honda s 2000
YOU1000000151_S0000119	now the downsides to the s 2000 kind of put me in a dilemma it is cramped in here it is loud you have got to send the engine revving to the stratosphere to get any power out of it these are all the same issues i have with the lotus elise
YOU1000000151_S0000120	and at 25 to 30 grand i am just going to buy the lotus but at 15 to 20 grand this car makes all kinds of sense
YOU1000000151_S0000122	what a day
YOU1000000151_S0000124	and what an amazing 3 cars
YOU1000000151_S0000126	i sat at each of these critiquing them and thinking we are splitting hairs here
YOU1000000151_S0000127	we are this is whisker differences and i am honest when i say i came into this day with an open mind truly i kind of thought i would come in picking the fr s and i did not i love the fr s
YOU1000000151_S0000128	it is a great car
YOU1000000151_S0000129	it is fantastic but the car i jumped into and just started smiling i knew was the winner for me and that was the s 2000
YOU1000000151_S0000130	i wanted the fr s to live up to the hype and be the best car here and i have to say i love it it is a great car it is still a 4 star it is still in my top 5 it is all of those things but the s 2000 is better
YOU1000000151_S0000131	i can not believe a car that is 10 years old is still so fantastic this is honda at the top of their game
YOU1000000151_S0000132	yeah where has that car gone in honda is lineup that is the car you know me i am not a big fan of convertibles that is the car that would make me buy a convertible i like it that much it is an incredible car
YOU1000000151_S0000133	well these 2 cars also answered the burning question does the fr s need more power
YOU1000000151_S0000135	now i have realized it should and these cars have 40 more horsepower
YOU1000000151_S0000137	and they have better weight distribution so they are a bit more predictable not that the fr s is bad though
YOU1000000151_S0000139	i really like this car i should put it another way i respect this car
YOU1000000151_S0000140	ok
YOU1000000151_S0000141	i can not fall in love with it i do not know what it is about it the other 2 just sparked me i fall in love with those 2 cars i have got to put the rx 83rd but not because it is a bad car it is a great car it is just not really for me i actually do not feel like that is as powerful as i want it to be
YOU1000000151_S0000143	with the fr s but the s 2000 just proves out £2800 with 240 horsepower that recipe starts to be exact and this one gets close but it just falls short if you drove them by themselves
YOU1000000151_S0000145	fantastic car you have no awareness that it could be different or better
YOU1000000151_S0000146	and of course our decisions could be wrong again
YOU1000000151_S0000148	with these cars they will be wrong someone will hate us someone will love us tell us in the comments we want to hear from you
YOU1000000151_S0000150	do not get me wrong it is great
YOU1000000151_S0000152	but it is not 1st place great not compared to these other 2 cars the fr s ties the s 2000 for best steering feel they are both good at different things
YOU1000000151_S0000153	it has got my 2nd favorite gearbox it is not nearly as good as the one in the s 2000
YOU1000000151_S0000155	when i drive it i find it the most endearing it talks to me the most it warms up to me the best it is the car that i just want to get into in any condition and that is pretty remarkable
YOU1000000151_S0000156	if you can find an r 3 if you can find one for sale
YOU1000000151_S0000158	buy this car the faster you go the more fun you have and it just it turns into a race car
YOU1000000151_S0000159	i am genuinely impressed but i do not lust after this car i do not want one and i do the other 2
YOU1000000151_S0000160	frankly i did not think this car would win for me but you realize this represents honda at the peak of their powers i do not understand why honda has gone completely off the rails
YOU1000000151_S0000161	and gotten away from making brilliant driving machines like the s 2000
YOU1000000151_S0000162	i will admit that i am not really a convertible guy but on a day like this on a road like this this car starts to make a lot of sense
YOU1000000152_S0000000	so
YOU1000000152_S0000001	how many bathrooms are in the house

YOU1000000152_S0000021	sure

YOU1000000153_S0000000	sometimes i really feel that the world around us continues to be more hectic and more complicated and so many of us are truly craving to find simplicity
YOU1000000153_S0000001	and here in queensland australia that is exactly what a young couple discovered when they made the decision to build a tiny house on wheels
YOU1000000153_S0000003	hi amy how are you
YOU1000000153_S0000004	hi how are you
YOU1000000153_S0000005	good lovely to meet you g day greg how is it going
YOU1000000153_S0000007	nice to meet you bryce
YOU1000000153_S0000008	it is nice to meet you and super cool to see this beautiful home
YOU1000000153_S0000009	thank you we are really glad to have you here
YOU1000000153_S0000010	so how did you come to be living in a tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000011	well we actually found out about the movement through one of your videos so i was binge watching the videos and sent one or 2 to greg and then said hey why do not we build a tiny house and to my surprise he agreed and
YOU1000000153_S0000012	took that and ran with it before he could change his mind so you know a few more months and we had a tiny house of our own
YOU1000000153_S0000013	and you really have found a fantastic parking spot for the home as well
YOU1000000153_S0000014	yeah we are really lucky because one of our friends has been kind enough to just let us park up here on our property in one of the goat paddocks essentially so yeah it is really nice we get a nice view it is very quiet we get away from a lot of the street noise and it is just
YOU1000000153_S0000015	peaceful
YOU1000000153_S0000016	yeah gives us a bit of land as well to be able to have a veggie patch and everything like that so and we have that nice community spirit with her and can have a family dinner every fortnight and yeah i could not want more i guess
YOU1000000153_S0000017	and what was it that made you really fall in love with the idea of living in a tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000018	i think for us it is probably the simplicity of the lifestyle i think also the financial freedom so that is probably the biggest part for us we do not want to be tied down to a job and then you know we can live a lifestyle we truly love
YOU1000000153_S0000019	yeah definitely
YOU1000000153_S0000020	and tell me a little bit about the esthetic of this home it is beautifully crafted
YOU1000000153_S0000021	well honestly most of it was amy we did it mainly from everything from the outside is mainly based from around that giant window we decided that any room that we were not going to have inside we were making sure that we could
YOU1000000153_S0000022	really spends a lot of time outside enjoying it
YOU1000000153_S0000023	i think i wanted something that would kind of sink into the background so nothing that would stand out too much and i like the cedar the natural look of that and i think whilst it can still sink into the background and it does not stand out too much it is really quite striking and modern
YOU1000000153_S0000024	and we really did spend a lot of time when we were in a bigger house we spent a lot more time in our outdoor area as it was so we kept the same outdoor area and just made a bit more space essentially than what we had there
YOU1000000153_S0000025	that is it so all of the decking is modular so greg spent hours laboring away with pallet wood and everything so he could keep the costs down and minimize that footprint on everything as well
YOU1000000153_S0000026	we have done that so if we ever need a move we can pull it all apart it would be a difficult task it would not be simple but it can be done and we can take it to our next parking spot
YOU1000000153_S0000027	really good sized water tank here as well
YOU1000000153_S0000028	yes so i think water was key we managed to make it through the drought period that we were here only just before we got all that downfall which was great but having the 2 kids and us we really needed a large tank so we have gone with a 10000 liter tank there
YOU1000000153_S0000029	color bond so it was not plastic which is important for the quality of water for us and it ties in really nicely with the design of the house so that was a bonus
YOU1000000153_S0000030	and now most of the time you live here by yourselves but greg sometimes you have your kids over as well do not you
YOU1000000153_S0000031	yes every 2nd week for 5 days we have them my son who is turning 13 this year and my daughter who is 10 we thought they would have a bit of trouble adapting to it but it was honestly very smooth when we introduced them to the house they got excited and then
YOU1000000153_S0000032	it was like yay we have somewhere to sleep now let us go play outside
YOU1000000153_S0000033	and so what size is the tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000034	so this one is 7.2 meters long that is 2.4 wide and about 4.2 high so we try to keep it all with the legal specs to be able to have it on the road
YOU1000000153_S0000035	well the house is just beautiful from the outside i really love this wonderful entertaining deck that you have built onto it and i cannot wait to see what you have got going on inside shall we check it out
YOU1000000153_S0000036	yes let us do it
YOU1000000153_S0000037	all right thank you
YOU1000000153_S0000039	0 this is gorgeous
YOU1000000153_S0000040	thank you we are very proud of it
YOU1000000153_S0000041	it is especially beautiful just walking in and immediately being greeted by this very comfortable looking lounge
YOU1000000153_S0000042	yeah comfort was the main goal with this so we found that in our regular sized house we spent a lot of time in the lounge room on the couch watching movies playing games with the kids so we needed a couch that could accommodate all 4 of us
YOU1000000153_S0000043	and be comfortable so we designed the layout actually of the lounge room based off the sizes of this couch so the chase does double as storage which is always important in your tiny house
YOU1000000153_S0000045	the bed obviously it pulls out from under there as well which is great to have that extra sleeping space if you need it
YOU1000000153_S0000046	we actually find that we spread that out more often than not yeah we like to pull that out to have more family time really we spend more time with it out just hanging out like that rather than just in this l shaped couch
YOU1000000153_S0000047	formal seating we like to laze out watch a movie play our games
YOU1000000153_S0000048	yeah
YOU1000000153_S0000049	sounds good to me and lots of windows here giving you really nice views into the outdoors
YOU1000000153_S0000050	yeah we really wanted to capitalize on the view and bring in as much natural light as possible for a tiny house i think if it is small it can feel even smaller if it does not have that natural light and that just makes it feel airy and bright and does not make you feel so claustrophobic i think
YOU1000000153_S0000052	and then we also get a beautiful cross breeze which is essential in the hot weather here so that helps as well keeps the place cool
YOU1000000153_S0000053	yeah it certainly is essential because the weather here you really do get some extremes do not you
YOU1000000153_S0000055	said i think in the last few months we have had floods and droughts so you know this has been a great way to be able to still keep cool and keep that electricity bill down
YOU1000000153_S0000056	and then you have got a really good sized kitchen here
YOU1000000153_S0000057	yes so we do a lot of meal prepping so we thought we would like a big bench i think that was key for us because we do the meal prepping together so we need to be able to work together in this space at one time and then it also doubles as a great space to be able to work and have our food as well
YOU1000000153_S0000058	study space so originally we made sure that this bench space that is at the end here was mainly just so that we could do work or study there as well so we have got space to do it
YOU1000000153_S0000059	yeah and we also want to have a lot of overhead cupboard space there as well for storage and to keep it nice and tidy rather than an open shelving just because it gets quite dusty out here in the bush area
YOU1000000153_S0000060	and it is so lovely how this window here can just completely open the kitchen up to the outdoors
YOU1000000153_S0000061	yeah so we actually designed a lot of the house around that by fall window there and when it opens up it really does brings the outside in we use it a lot with
YOU1000000153_S0000062	if we have friends over we meal prep here and just hand the meals over out there and we can all still talk and communicate together and this sort of starts to feel more like an island bench in a kitchen rather than a wall separating you guys and it is really cool
YOU1000000153_S0000063	and then really good size appliances here in the kitchen full size fridge and lots of storage that has been built into the stairs there too
YOU1000000153_S0000064	yes so this was a little bit to get it to work the fridge was from our previous standard house and we wanted to keep that just because we like the design of the fridge space being up the top we have popped our microwave in here which is
YOU1000000153_S0000065	keeping it nice and well hidden also has extra storage for chopping boards and bread which is really great to keep the cabinets nice and clear up here the rest of the storage shower is actually for our clothing and then behind these baskets we have got quite a deep space here
YOU1000000153_S0000066	so we can hide extra items like our blender in there as well and some clothing and a spot up there for all the dog stuff as well keeps it all neat and tidy and keeps our benches clear which is really good
YOU1000000153_S0000067	yeah and because we like to food prep so much not downsizing on the oven was essential for us as well so we need to make sure that we kept that oven the right size we downgraded to the 2 burner stove but that was not an issue really because
YOU1000000153_S0000068	yeah like we do things out of a slow cooker or the oven the rest of the time so it was not really a problem
YOU1000000153_S0000069	and the other stories that we really love in here is actually our pull up pantry so a lot of work went into that and we actually measured out how thick we needed it to be to fit jars in and everything so make the most of that space as well
YOU1000000153_S0000070	then we have got the loft above us here
YOU1000000153_S0000071	yes so that was actually in addition that we added to the standard design with this one we needed to have a space for the children as well so that is really great because they can have their own space and be apart from us but they are still part of the family unit
YOU1000000153_S0000072	we chose not to enclose it just so i could have that open feel and also to limit it getting too hot up there with the cross breeze as well
YOU1000000153_S0000073	and then through there we have your bathroom and it is really nice how you have created this full length louver window
YOU1000000153_S0000074	yes the window we wanted to create a space i guess where from one end of the house to the other it was really open ended so when you are sitting in the lounge room and looking through
YOU1000000153_S0000075	you just see straight out into nature and it does not just cut the house off and feel like it suddenly ends
YOU1000000153_S0000076	great size shower you have got in here
YOU1000000153_S0000077	yes so it is not quite the same as a 900 it is i think 820 by 820 so a little bit smaller than normal but we have a beautiful waterfall shower head which makes it really luxurious to have a shower in there
YOU1000000153_S0000078	we also have the addition of another lever window there just to try bring the inside out again and also to extract some of that steam which can cause a bit of trouble in a tiny space as well so it feels very lovely having a shower in there actually probably better than our old house
YOU1000000153_S0000079	it is one of the best showers we have ever had in that thing so yeah it is amazing
YOU1000000153_S0000080	and then it is great to see you have got the composting toilet here
YOU1000000153_S0000081	yes so that was probably our favorite thing about the house really yeah it was the toilet when we asked that question i think it is just that it is so unique in design and being in a drought area i guess it is so great with the water usage
YOU1000000153_S0000083	yeah we think that was one of the things that helped us get through a part of that drought period before we started to get all the floods was the fact that we did not have a flushing toilet we were getting very close to the end of our tank and we thankfully got the rain but yeah the composting toilet it does not use
YOU1000000153_S0000084	water to get rid of it it is so much easier
YOU1000000153_S0000085	and great to see you have got the washing machine there as well
YOU1000000153_S0000087	that is it from our old house as well we have worked out really well did not have to buy new appliances no need for a dryer in this climate so we just hang everything up outside under the deck or in the sun
YOU1000000153_S0000088	we do make sure that we use a lot of the eco friendly dishwashing liquids and the laundry detergent is the same as well so that when it runs off to our gray water because we use that out in our grasses and gardens and things like that we will help
YOU1000000153_S0000089	yeah not putting anything toxic out into the environment as well
YOU1000000153_S0000090	of course
YOU1000000153_S0000091	so recycle all the water we can here
YOU1000000153_S0000092	yeah and then really nice size vanity in here as well
YOU1000000153_S0000093	yes so i think every girl wants a nice big vanity so this was kind of my brainchild i wanted the pendant lights and the shelving for my beauty products a big nice thing to be able to wash my face and do my makeup
YOU1000000153_S0000095	and i think it just it works really well as well with the kids generally getting the kids ready for school there is 2 of them in the bathroom it is nice and big they can both still brush their teeth do their hair do what they need to at the same time no one is fighting and yeah it works good
YOU1000000153_S0000096	and then upstairs we have got your sleeping loft
YOU1000000153_S0000097	yes a little sanctuary
YOU1000000153_S0000099	this is just so cozy up here and having that skylight is just lovely is not it
YOU1000000153_S0000100	yeah this loft is our sanctuary and this skylight really just makes it what it is it brings in all of that light
YOU1000000153_S0000101	yeah i think even compared to our bedrooms at previous homes this is probably the most comfortable and luxurious that we have had we invested in a good mattress that was a little bit thinner so it could gain a little bit of extra room
YOU1000000153_S0000102	and yeah it has been a lovely experience being up here
YOU1000000153_S0000103	i think that a lot of people see sleeping lofts and they immediately kind of freak out and say i could never do that but there really is something which is just so cozy and comfortable about climbing into a loft and you feel so protected in the space like this do not you
YOU1000000153_S0000105	it is like a nest and it is safe i think if we had have enclosed maybe the front portion of it it might feel a little bit more claustrophobic but it is so airy and bright and i think you know you do not feel confined or anything like that it is very open
YOU1000000153_S0000106	the view that we have is quite nice as well and we get the views out to the sides and at night we get the night sky it is amazing up here it is not anything to really be worried about it is one of those things that we look forward to
YOU1000000153_S0000107	yeah i think a lot of people are nervous about the transition to a loft style and it is probably not ideal for people with mobility issues but the stairs are easy to navigate we have not had any issues got a handrail there and everything to help
YOU1000000153_S0000108	yeah it has been an easy transition
YOU1000000153_S0000109	and so how long have you been living in the tiny house now
YOU1000000153_S0000110	i think we are going on just on 6 months now of phil time living in the tiny house so it has gone really fast actually
YOU1000000153_S0000111	we actually could not believe we went like 4 months without a tv
YOU1000000153_S0000112	yeah i mean time goes so fast i guess and i think in another sense it also does not feel like it is only been 6 months yeah you know it was an easy change of lifestyle change of pace and it is just been such an easy transition into it that i think it feels like
YOU1000000153_S0000113	this is something we have been doing for years and i think we spent such a long time in the design phase and the builders work so closely with us i do not think there is anything that has gone into this that is not a well thought out process
YOU1000000153_S0000114	yeah a lot of people ask us you know are you over the tiny house yet
YOU1000000153_S0000116	in love with the design every day and the lifestyle it offers
YOU1000000153_S0000117	absolutely
YOU1000000153_S0000118	and can we talk a little bit about price what did this cost to build
YOU1000000153_S0000119	so all up we spent about $10 so that included the build furnishings the water tank delivery so significantly less than a mortgage
YOU1000000153_S0000120	everything that we pay for daily or sorry monthly now as well has significantly dropped like electricity prices like we are not off grid yet but we do plan on this being a solar powered house eventually as well
YOU1000000153_S0000121	with water like we said we have got a 10000 liter tank and that gets us by fine it is just been a very comfortable transition with money wise as well like expenditures going out is another thing that made it very comfortable
YOU1000000153_S0000122	yeah absolutely
YOU1000000153_S0000123	and so what does the future hold for you both now
YOU1000000153_S0000124	honestly hopefully a lot more travel and exploring and living life and enjoying it so hopefully the freedom that comes with this tiny will allow us to become financially free as well
YOU1000000153_S0000125	and have a 5 year plan hopefully and buy a big block of our own and yeah to see where it takes us i guess
YOU1000000153_S0000126	yeah we are excited to be able to hopefully take this over to a bigger block i do not think we could ever do a normal sized house ever again though no absolutely not tiny is something we will always stick with but yeah we will definitely be doing a lot more living again now
YOU1000000153_S0000127	we can it is really opened up a lot of freedom in our lives and it seems weird to say that i moved into a smaller house so now i am more free but once you do it you really get it
YOU1000000153_S0000128	it becomes about the lifestyle opposed to doing that daily grind to pay for a house that you do not get to enjoy
YOU1000000153_S0000129	which we thoroughly do enjoy
YOU1000000153_S0000130	yes absolutely i think living in this home it is taught us something that we maybe did not expect i guess our transition to tiny living was
YOU1000000153_S0000132	born from a more tragic time in our life you know the passing of my father and everything that caused us to question how we were living life and what direction we were going you know we did not want to
YOU1000000153_S0000133	sit back in 50 years time and realize that we had wasted time with our family and loved ones and you know gone through the daily grind and had enjoyed life so it is really it has been an opening experience
YOU1000000153_S0000134	it generally comes down to time like the experience of being in this house it comes down to how much time we have now we have time together we have time to just be in
YOU1000000153_S0000135	a sense where we are not worried about the hustle and bustle of daily life where we are able to relax together we are able to problem solve together we are able to just be together and i think
YOU1000000153_S0000136	make the most of every day
YOU1000000153_S0000137	yeah
YOU1000000153_S0000138	not promised tomorrow so you have got to live with it now

YOU1000000154_S0000003	today we are going to do something new we are at western avenue in brentwood and we are going to talk about phillip is new project from colossal properties
YOU1000000154_S0000005	so what i thought with this thing is we are going to try and attach this 360 camera to it and then effectively that means that i am not holding it and walking through the property you can basically just control it as if someone is looking at it in vr or they are looking at it in facebook
YOU1000000154_S0000006	it is as if they are walking through the house we are going to save it because it is a test
YOU1000000154_S0000008	okay philip so this looks pretty incredible
YOU1000000154_S0000009	yeah awesome we are about 2 weeks out
YOU1000000154_S0000010	2 weeks out i was going to literally going to ask that because it is looking a lot further on than i thought
YOU1000000154_S0000012	yes this one is in the completion phase
YOU1000000154_S0000013	i mean someone is going to walk in here and effectively kind of get taken in awe by a
YOU1000000154_S0000015	it looks like you have got something hiding up there which i do not want to ask you about yet but let us go and explore
YOU1000000154_S0000017	this is a 2 year project
YOU1000000154_S0000019	so broke ground 2 years ago
YOU1000000154_S0000020	yep
YOU1000000154_S0000021	that is very different
YOU1000000154_S0000023	yeah flipping would be much much quicker
YOU1000000154_S0000025	6 months is best generally i turn it around 2 3 maybe 4 months if you are on it every single day it goes quick but these things because of the scale they just take time
YOU1000000154_S0000027	so let us go explore it let us have a look and ns i want you to ask some really in depth questions about it
YOU1000000154_S0000029	definitely i am excited to see this phillip tell me how much this store weighs
YOU1000000154_S0000030	this is a £600 door
YOU1000000154_S0000032	in order to get it
YOU1000000154_S0000034	that is like the weight of a .
YOU1000000154_S0000036	it is not a couple screws holding it in place people it takes a lot of work to get these in place
YOU1000000154_S0000038	floating staircase cable rails
YOU1000000154_S0000039	you know what that is really awesome because i feel like that area under the stairs is always such an underutilized area and you have actually kind of created
YOU1000000154_S0000041	yeah we will show a piece
YOU1000000154_S0000043	like frames did staircase
YOU1000000154_S0000044	so here we will have the glass and there will be led
YOU1000000154_S0000046	and it looks like temperature control
YOU1000000154_S0000047	temperature controls
YOU1000000154_S0000049	and the recessed lighting is going to be the only lighting in there
YOU1000000154_S0000051	led strip light
YOU1000000154_S0000052	that is what i thought
YOU1000000154_S0000054	check it out
YOU1000000154_S0000055	check it out
YOU1000000154_S0000056	so let us come through here i mean one thing i have to say which i think you are incredibly good at is this
YOU1000000154_S0000058	you are not allowed to use the sink
YOU1000000154_S0000060	very clean look
YOU1000000154_S0000061	same thing with the bridge the panel
YOU1000000154_S0000063	are you finding that is a general thing now people need more than one fridge
YOU1000000154_S0000065	i think you need it yeah you got to store all your fresh coconut juices
YOU1000000154_S0000067	and then you have beautiful cladding throughout you even went all the way into the window sills
YOU1000000154_S0000068	yeah we took it inside the window sill here just to finish it off nicely
YOU1000000154_S0000069	perfect
YOU1000000154_S0000071	yeah exactly
YOU1000000154_S0000072	so can we declare you literally have 3 things
YOU1000000154_S0000074	they better like eating food
YOU1000000154_S0000075	no
YOU1000000154_S0000077	yeah we are going to put it in action because of all the glass on this side we put in the ceiling so
YOU1000000154_S0000079	since we did not have a real tv wall
YOU1000000154_S0000081	and so all the 65 inch tv there mounted
YOU1000000154_S0000083	sitting there enjoying nature in the creek and you get a little bit like 0 you know what there is a game on here
YOU1000000154_S0000084	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000085	you can also sit in the same seat push a button and a tv appears in front of you
YOU1000000154_S0000087	alright let us go and see this balcony look now which is the creek right here
YOU1000000154_S0000089	so fire pit we know that you are a big fan of fire pits and they are in every single one of your properties i remember
YOU1000000154_S0000091	this one is an ethanol fire pit yeah this is an ethanol
YOU1000000154_S0000093	we do have a gas one on the lower level but this one is ethanol
YOU1000000154_S0000094	so is that becoming a bigger trend do you think
YOU1000000154_S0000096	couple different varieties of fire features in the house
YOU1000000154_S0000099	okay cool and then looking at these i am in love with these railings right here i feel like when we go and see luxury development properties right now it is glass glass glass
YOU1000000154_S0000100	yes
YOU1000000154_S0000101	and like you have told me
YOU1000000154_S0000102	yeah and they do not look the greatest once house starts aging versus these i feel like have much longer lifespan looking good while they are serving a purpose
YOU1000000154_S0000104	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000105	so what was the reason you ended up going for this direction
YOU1000000154_S0000107	well actually this was the architect is selection
YOU1000000154_S0000108	okay
YOU1000000154_S0000109	the architect david hertz he is based out of venice
YOU1000000154_S0000110	which we know his name but if you guys out there do not know david hertz go and look up malibu what is it technically called that house
YOU1000000154_S0000111	i think the airplane
YOU1000000154_S0000112	airplane house
YOU1000000154_S0000114	yeah these 747 jumbo jet wings used as a roof
YOU1000000154_S0000115	yeah and so yeah look that up guys because it is the same guy that designed that that has brought his design feel to it
YOU1000000154_S0000116	and he likes to integrate some industrial elements into modern designs that is why you see like the steel railing and the cable rail he likes to bring in some of that industrial
YOU1000000154_S0000118	since we are up here can we talk about this beautiful cladding that you have on
YOU1000000154_S0000119	0 yeah absolutely
YOU1000000154_S0000120	which you can actually see you guys are like halfway through
YOU1000000154_S0000122	putting on a sealer oil based sealer so this is cedar wood and it has been tongue and groove milled again it is a selection from david hertz
YOU1000000154_S0000123	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000124	who likes to use not only some industrial elements like this railing but natural elements that you know recyclable and organic
YOU1000000154_S0000126	but this
YOU1000000154_S0000128	this is an area i always
YOU1000000154_S0000130	we have got some little corridor leading people do not spend time here why would you have to matter about night
YOU1000000154_S0000131	right
YOU1000000154_S0000132	it makes so much
YOU1000000154_S0000134	up on this floor top floor of the property yes what have we got up there
YOU1000000154_S0000135	so up here we have 4 bedrooms and plus an office
YOU1000000154_S0000136	so you are not saying the office is a bedroom like a lot of people
YOU1000000154_S0000137	that is true
YOU1000000154_S0000138	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000140	3 guests 7
YOU1000000154_S0000141	it is still guest bedroom stuff this is the living room
YOU1000000154_S0000143	i miss work
YOU1000000154_S0000144	this is the worst
YOU1000000154_S0000145	it is better i mean it is bigger than my current bedroom
YOU1000000154_S0000146	0 my what a bedroom apartment
YOU1000000154_S0000147	yes
YOU1000000154_S0000149	so this is salongo and actually again architecture you have got 1234 different aspects
YOU1000000154_S0000151	different high windows clear stories
YOU1000000154_S0000153	and so is this kind of playing a game with what
YOU1000000154_S0000155	so let us stop for you to see all the cool roof designs start feeling that in the space
YOU1000000154_S0000156	okay
YOU1000000154_S0000157	okay so here we are in the mosque
YOU1000000154_S0000158	we are in the master
YOU1000000154_S0000159	and again your thing with stone has gone to another level with this architect where actually you have put an incredible piece of stonework
YOU1000000154_S0000160	but it is also matching the line of the ceiling
YOU1000000154_S0000161	absolutely yeah this is white marble yeah and we set it up here in the fireplace matching the ceiling design
YOU1000000154_S0000162	and double pocket doors on the exterior which were really difficult to do because the exterior doors have to be waterproof and they get them to sit right inside the door
YOU1000000154_S0000163	and then also did blackout shades
YOU1000000154_S0000164	for all these windows in this room which again was a challenge because look at this design of the windows wow and the upper clear stories so we actually have pockets
YOU1000000154_S0000165	that reverse roll up in order to block out the light coming in
YOU1000000154_S0000166	and philip tell us about this book matching i mean the stone looks beautiful there yeah but i know it was not easy
YOU1000000154_S0000168	we do have the bookmatching with this vein coming here and white marble extremely heavy
YOU1000000154_S0000169	so yeah it is kind of got this organic feel it is pretty cool
YOU1000000154_S0000170	and then all the windows basically lead towards the beautiful balcony you have with the same style of railing and you have this amazing all i see is green trees
YOU1000000154_S0000171	i know
YOU1000000154_S0000172	that is insane
YOU1000000154_S0000173	yeah it is
YOU1000000154_S0000174	it feels like you are not in a city
YOU1000000154_S0000175	you can really get a good perspective of the land when you come up here as well
YOU1000000154_S0000176	is you have almost hired the architect to create light streams to give this plot
YOU1000000154_S0000177	so yeah this is cool this is like an exterior skylight out here
YOU1000000154_S0000178	it is so cool and this is the architect is style that way
YOU1000000154_S0000179	architect so this way you get a balcony overhang but you also get some additional sunlight coming in
YOU1000000154_S0000180	and it is just such a beautiful detail that ties everything together
YOU1000000154_S0000181	so we just walked into the master bathroom and i am just seeing details everywhere and i have seen this custom beautiful
YOU1000000154_S0000183	so phil tell us what it takes to get a piece like this in here
YOU1000000154_S0000184	right so we call this an integrated sink which means we take stone in this case the caeser stone quartz and we build a sink out of the extra stone
YOU1000000154_S0000185	work the seams and you also have the seams built in with the same material right
YOU1000000154_S0000186	that is building the sinks and a cabinetry underneath the drawers
YOU1000000154_S0000187	it looks so simple here but getting all these details right getting all the corners edges everything leveled it is a tremendous amount of work
YOU1000000154_S0000188	and then we will have a big mirror next to the law after we solve that
YOU1000000154_S0000189	yeah let us talk about this shower let us talk about the old .
YOU1000000154_S0000191	we put the body sprays in
YOU1000000154_S0000192	very nice
YOU1000000154_S0000194	yes exactly and then the rain shower head
YOU1000000154_S0000197	nice
YOU1000000154_S0000198	and then the drainage is down there
YOU1000000154_S0000200	back with the talons of sir graham
YOU1000000154_S0000201	exactly just look seamless your eyes are not going straight into the drain you just want it to look really natural that is the goal really
YOU1000000154_S0000202	and i do not know if that shower head is big enough to it
YOU1000000154_S0000204	so we just walked into the 1st floor space and i mean i see this countertop i have got to ask what is that code
YOU1000000154_S0000206	almost looks like it
YOU1000000154_S0000208	we have a
YOU1000000154_S0000210	panels that are built in so you can up light it and change the colors and all that stuff
YOU1000000154_S0000211	so you get any option of color
YOU1000000154_S0000213	this is more of the entertaining space you come down here we will have a bar a smoke mirror led lit shelves for the liquor we have a wine fridge fridge sink dishwasher
YOU1000000154_S0000214	seats here at the counter top and then opening up to the family room and opening up to the backyard and i want to show you guys this cool 12 person movie theater
YOU1000000154_S0000216	i mean you can already tell the sound difference
YOU1000000154_S0000217	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000218	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000219	so you better talk about the cladding that you use for the walls
YOU1000000154_S0000220	so this is acoustic paneling and then we put a wall covering on it we also did the speakers so those speakers do not
YOU1000000154_S0000222	if you actually get close to it you can see the seams but eventually it blends into the look
YOU1000000154_S0000223	yeah and then we did some wall sconces surround sounds so there is like a subwoofer there again
YOU1000000154_S0000224	buried under the paneling and then a curved projector screen
YOU1000000154_S0000226	we just stepped outside and now let us talk about this backyard
YOU1000000154_S0000227	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000228	serious
YOU1000000154_S0000229	entertainers dream 40 foot long pool hot tub 12 foot long fire pit outdoor kitchen with a beer tab
YOU1000000154_S0000230	grill trellis
YOU1000000154_S0000231	so these tiles are awesome
YOU1000000154_S0000232	0 yeah this stuff is very expensive
YOU1000000154_S0000234	they highlighted night
YOU1000000154_S0000235	yeah it will get a little shimmer to them
YOU1000000154_S0000236	if you do not mind me asking how much you paid for a square foot if you remember
YOU1000000154_S0000237	that is about $35 a foot
YOU1000000154_S0000238	to people out there you can get a tile for your pool for like 3 bucks a foot ask 10 times more
YOU1000000154_S0000239	since we are in the pool let us talk about the finish that you are going to do because i see tile but i see the remaining of the pool
YOU1000000154_S0000240	still unfinished what do you have in mind
YOU1000000154_S0000241	exactly yes so we have the tile and then what we are going to do is finish with plaster
YOU1000000154_S0000242	and pebble tack which kind of have some pebbles it will be a dark plaster so it will kind of look like the ocean
YOU1000000154_S0000243	beautiful it is going to look so great
YOU1000000154_S0000244	and the architect designed the pool to have
YOU1000000154_S0000246	so if you see he has a staircase
YOU1000000154_S0000248	and
YOU1000000154_S0000250	and this way this stays all clear to the swim lane so we will do a couple laps
YOU1000000154_S0000252	yeah
YOU1000000154_S0000253	did a pretty good job kicking this
YOU1000000154_S0000254	and then infinity edge with the water going over
YOU1000000154_S0000255	yeah water i am assuming are flowing from this into the pool
YOU1000000154_S0000256	yes and then there is a waterfall out on that side too you can see on the back side
YOU1000000154_S0000257	okay
YOU1000000154_S0000258	so now we are at the point where we are going to check out the backyard but i want my boy ed to come with me so what do you say
YOU1000000154_S0000260	well my leg is not working so i do not know what you want me to do
YOU1000000154_S0000261	well i got your back
YOU1000000154_S0000262	you want to carry me down the stairs
YOU1000000154_S0000264	okay you sure about this
YOU1000000154_S0000266	0 my god
YOU1000000154_S0000267	alright we ready just keep yourself in place
YOU1000000154_S0000268	this is where the lawsuit starts to happen
YOU1000000154_S0000270	and we have the owner here but perfect
YOU1000000154_S0000271	okay that was pretty sweet
YOU1000000154_S0000273	at least you know the stairs are built in a way you can carry something
YOU1000000154_S0000274	we can marry someone
YOU1000000154_S0000275	and i think i am going to charge him for his gym member
YOU1000000154_S0000277	giving them a good workout okay so we have just come down here to the backyard literally when we see these luxury properties it is almost like 0 yeah i have got a 20000 square foot lot but 90% of it is like that
YOU1000000154_S0000278	right
YOU1000000154_S0000279	which the problem is you can not really use it this you actually come down here thinking there is nothing down here
YOU1000000154_S0000280	you have basically got your own area you can put a foot in
YOU1000000154_S0000282	that is nuts
YOU1000000154_S0000283	this is natural
YOU1000000154_S0000284	so it was like this when you had it
YOU1000000154_S0000285	it was like this it was just a little more grown in but we kind of cleared it up getting ready to put some grass in
YOU1000000154_S0000286	we restored the creek bed because when it rains this actually is a natural flood channel that goes all the way down to san vicente and then the ocean
YOU1000000154_S0000287	so we restored the creek bed we put a little bridge
YOU1000000154_S0000288	and we are going to put some lighting in the trees and make this little magical garden area or the meadow as we call it

YOU1000000155_S0000000	real estate investing rules of thumb the 2% rule the 50% rule and the 70% rule
YOU1000000155_S0000001	there are some rules of thumb that can help investors quickly screen through deals to make a good educated guess on whether or not to pursue them
YOU1000000155_S0000002	now this is important notice that i did not say there are some rules of thumb that can help investors make purchase decisions
YOU1000000155_S0000003	because rules of thumb are not meant to be hard and fast rules they simply help an investor get a quick and dirty opinion on some valuable metrics
YOU1000000155_S0000004	always do a proper analysis but regardless these rules of thumb can come in really handy in saving you from analyzing every single deal that you come across
YOU1000000155_S0000005	my name is brandon turner and in this video i have outlined several of the most common real estate math rules of thumb
YOU1000000155_S0000006	so you can begin practicing them in your own analysis of properties
YOU1000000155_S0000008	1st the 2% rule also known as the one rule or the 2% test
YOU1000000155_S0000009	perhaps one of the most common rules of thumb used by rental property investors is known as the 2% rule
YOU1000000155_S0000010	but not because it is a rule so i say 2% test i like that better
YOU1000000155_S0000011	essentially this rule of thumb looks at the monthly rent divided by the value of the property in a percentage form
YOU1000000155_S0000012	for those who just got confused let us make this super simple if a property rents for $2000 a month
YOU1000000155_S0000013	and the value is $20 then 2000 divided by 20 equals one 
YOU1000000155_S0000014	in this example the property does not pass the 2% test but it does meet the one test exactly
YOU1000000155_S0000015	or what if a property that rents for $1500 a month and it costs $180000 to buy well $1500 divided by $180000 is .8%
YOU1000000155_S0000016	that is definitely short of the one rule or one test now what if that property rents for $1500 a month but it is worth $120000
YOU1000000155_S0000017	well 1500 divided by 120000 equals one.25% alright so you get how the math works now right but what does it mean
YOU1000000155_S0000018	well essentially the one or 2% test gives us a quick and dirty view on whether or not the property will produce positive cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000019	and of course just a rule of thumb it is not always precise but generally speaking the higher the percentage the better the cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000020	this also greatly depends on location price and how much the expenses truly are on the property
YOU1000000155_S0000021	but the rule of thumb can help an investor make some decisions on whether or not to pursue a certain property
YOU1000000155_S0000022	for example i know that most properties that fall short of one will likely never produce a positive cash flow for me
YOU1000000155_S0000023	if it is between one and 2% it probably will and if it is above 2% which is really hard to find today then i am almost positive that it will
YOU1000000155_S0000024	so if my real estate agent tells me that they have a perfect rental house for me to buy and i see that the purchase price is $125000
YOU1000000155_S0000025	and i find that it will rent for $1000 a month i can make a very quick decision and i know that most likely that deal aint going to ever provide cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000026	because it falls short of the one rule because 1000 divided by 125000 equals 0.8%
YOU1000000155_S0000027	in a case like this i probably would not even spend any more time looking at the deal if i was only interested in the cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000028	so that is the value of the 2% rule test thing while the 2% rule and the one rule or test we just mentioned
YOU1000000155_S0000029	they can help you get with a go no go decision on looking further into a rental property
YOU1000000155_S0000030	it does not really tell us how much cash flow we might expect for that investors often rely on the 50% rule of thumb
YOU1000000155_S0000031	the 50% rule states that on average and over time half of the income in a property is spent on operating expenses
YOU1000000155_S0000032	now what are operating expenses well good question operating expenses are all of the expenses involved with running a rental property
YOU1000000155_S0000033	except the loan payment so it includes taxes insurance utilities repairs vacancy and other metrics
YOU1000000155_S0000034	that leave the landlord is checking account every single month or every year depends on how you want to look at it
YOU1000000155_S0000035	the 50% rule can help an investor quickly estimate the cash flow of a rental property because it combines all of those expenses except for the loan into one easy number
YOU1000000155_S0000037	so let us work through this imagine a property rents for $2000 a month the 50% rule says half of this a 1000 will be spent on expenses
YOU1000000155_S0000038	this means we are left with a 1000 bucks but now we need to make the mortgage payment on this right unless you paid cash for the property but let us say you did not
YOU1000000155_S0000039	so with that $1000 we have left let us say the mortgage is $600 so how much do you have left 400 bucks
YOU1000000155_S0000040	because 2000 times 50% equals 1000 1000 -600 for operating expenses is $400 in cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000041	that remaining number is what you can estimate over time on average you might get in monthly cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000042	of course that 50% estimate on operating expenses can really vary wildly depending on the property
YOU1000000155_S0000043	in some areas taxes and insurance might be incredibly high but in other areas it might be much lower some properties require that the landlord pay all utilities
YOU1000000155_S0000044	where other properties allow the tenant to pay their own and while inherent weaknesses do exist
YOU1000000155_S0000045	the 50% rule does have value i mean when you are looking at a property that rents for $1200 a month
YOU1000000155_S0000047	and you know the mortgage payment would be around a 1000 you can pretty much guarantee that property will not produce a positive cash flow
YOU1000000155_S0000048	because 200 bucks a month is not a lot of room for all those expenses because 1200 times 50% equals 600
YOU1000000155_S0000049	600 minus a 1000 is -400 now the 50% rule helps keep real estate investors in check
YOU1000000155_S0000050	and to remind us that there are a lot of expenses that over time add up yeah i mean a new roof is only needed every 20 years
YOU1000000155_S0000051	but if you divide a $10000 roof into 240 months that roof is actually costing you $42 a month every single month
YOU1000000155_S0000052	these operating expenses add up over time and as most investors have seen they tend to settle around 50% given a long enough time frame
YOU1000000155_S0000053	okay on to the final rule of thumb today the 70% rule
YOU1000000155_S0000054	the last couple rules of thumb that we talked about were designed to help rental property owners but what about the house flippers the wholesalers i do not want to leave you guys out
YOU1000000155_S0000055	so for those who are flipping houses the 70% rule can be helpful in determining just how much to pay for a property
YOU1000000155_S0000056	the 70% rule states that the most you should pay for a potential flip is 70% of the after repair value like what it would sell for when it was all fixed up
YOU1000000155_S0000057	minus the repair costs so example if a home would sell for 300 grand all fixed up and the property needed 50 grand worth of work to get there
YOU1000000155_S0000058	then 30 times 70% is 210000 subtract out that $50000 and you are left with 160 k
YOU1000000155_S0000059	according to the 70% rule the most someone should pay for that property would be $160 k but of course there are problems with the 70% rule
YOU1000000155_S0000060	this rule of thumb assumes that 30% of the arv the after repair value is going to be spent on holding costs on clothing costs on the buying side the selling side
YOU1000000155_S0000061	commissions taxes attorney fees title company fees and more and the flippers profit and any other charges that come up during the deal now this works well in some markets
YOU1000000155_S0000062	but it has some severe limitations
YOU1000000155_S0000063	for example the 70% rule does not really work that well for a property with a really low arv after repair value
YOU1000000155_S0000064	such as $50000 as mentioned earlier the 30% deducted from the arv includes the holding costs and the closing costs as well as the profit
YOU1000000155_S0000065	the investor or the flipper wants to make however like 30% of 50 grand is like $15000 so following the 70% rule
YOU1000000155_S0000066	all of the fees cost and profit would only be $15000
YOU1000000155_S0000067	if the fees and holding costs were to total like 10 grand that would leave just $5000 in profit for the house flipper
YOU1000000155_S0000068	and i do not know any house flipper who is going to take on the risk of flipping a house for just 5 grand
YOU1000000155_S0000069	so following the 70% rule a flipper or wholesaler would pay far too much for the property in this example
YOU1000000155_S0000070	and investor flipping houses at this level might require far less than 70% maybe a 50% or even lower
YOU1000000155_S0000071	now a similar problem exists with the 70% rule for more expensive properties
YOU1000000155_S0000072	the 70% rule would dictate that a home with an arv of 700 grand that needs 50 grand to work
YOU1000000155_S0000073	should produce a maximum offer of $440000
YOU1000000155_S0000074	but in most markets finding a $70 property for $440000 is simply not feasible
YOU1000000155_S0000075	a person who sticks exclusively to that 70% rule are likely never going to find a good enough deal to ever flip a single property in that market
YOU1000000155_S0000076	in this case 80% or even 85% might be good enough
YOU1000000155_S0000077	furthermore some investors may spend more or less on fees and costs because of their particular life situation or location
YOU1000000155_S0000078	for example in some states purchasing a home may require 3 grand in closing costs while in other states it might be $6000
YOU1000000155_S0000079	some investors may have a real estate license which saves them 10s of 1000s of dollars in commissions
YOU1000000155_S0000080	whereas other investors well they may need to pay commissions when they actually sell the property so how should the 70% rule be valued
YOU1000000155_S0000081	well carefully it is a quick and dirty way to guesstimate the approximate amount you should pay for a property
YOU1000000155_S0000082	but as with all rules of thumb no concrete decisions should be made unless you have run a real estate analysis on the property
YOU1000000155_S0000083	and of course if you want to do that check out the biggerpockets suite of calculators you can get them at biggerpockets com forward slash calc c a l c

YOU1000000157_S0000027	so what do you want to tell me about this
YOU1000000157_S0000028	well i have been there 15 years no problem we got new neighbors that moved in and they called the cops on me they could have knocked on the door i would have turned the music down
YOU1000000157_S0000030	was it a radio or was it a .
YOU1000000157_S0000031	0 it was the radio
YOU1000000157_S0000032	radio
YOU1000000157_S0000033	you have the amplifiers
YOU1000000157_S0000034	yes sir
YOU1000000157_S0000035	yeah they are both fires
YOU1000000157_S0000036	yeah
YOU1000000157_S0000037	what time of day was it
YOU1000000157_S0000038	i think it was about 110 clock
YOU1000000157_S0000039	at night
YOU1000000157_S0000040	yes sir
YOU1000000157_S0000041	yeah
YOU1000000157_S0000043	mister crawford i have a summons before me
YOU1000000157_S0000045	that indicates that on april 27th that
YOU1000000157_S0000047	there was all music coming from your residence
YOU1000000157_S0000048	it does not say
YOU1000000157_S0000050	the time
YOU1000000157_S0000052	so the summons is incomplete
YOU1000000157_S0000054	my philosophy is that everyone should be entitled
YOU1000000157_S0000056	to the full benefit of the law whether or not they are an experienced attorney or not so if you came here with an attorney today an attorney would make a motion to dismiss
YOU1000000157_S0000057	because the summons is incomplete now you do not know that because you are not a lawyer but there is no reason why you should not have the benefit of having the law enforced on your behalf
YOU1000000157_S0000058	but i know that and it would be immoral if i find you when the summons is incomplete so i am going to dismiss it
YOU1000000157_S0000059	thank you your honor
YOU1000000157_S0000060	with the promise from you that keep the music down right
YOU1000000157_S0000061	okay

YOU1000000157_S0000067	give him the grape street slide
YOU1000000157_S0000069	there you go
YOU1000000157_S0000071	thank you your honor

YOU1000000157_S0000076	excuse me i got up at 5 a m and drove through 3 hours of boston traffic because i believe in my innocence and i plead not guilty
YOU1000000157_S0000078	by pleading not guilty what you are saying is you want to come back and have a trial
YOU1000000157_S0000079	no okay then i do not plead not guilty can you look at my summons
YOU1000000157_S0000080	yeah look at those summons

YOU1000000157_S0000082	caroline i do not hear a word you say unless you speak
YOU1000000157_S0000083	based on what i believe i heard you say earlier it is a faulty summons
YOU1000000157_S0000084	really
YOU1000000157_S0000085	well maybe i did not understand
YOU1000000157_S0000086	explain that to me
YOU1000000157_S0000087	because the because
YOU1000000157_S0000089	.
YOU1000000157_S0000091	i am
YOU1000000157_S0000092	the speed i was supposed to be driving at is not posted
YOU1000000157_S0000093	0 you earned that
YOU1000000157_S0000094	that is what i thought i heard
YOU1000000157_S0000095	you were listening
YOU1000000157_S0000096	i was listening
YOU1000000157_S0000098	every single word i said and you said i wonder if any of this applies to me
YOU1000000157_S0000099	no i still believed in my innocence before that
YOU1000000157_S0000100	well tell me about it
YOU1000000157_S0000101	well i came back and went to the school and recreated the scene and took film at night
YOU1000000157_S0000102	i used to be a school teacher and it is very very hard to see the speed limit at that location there is no speed limit in front of the school
YOU1000000157_S0000103	that is why i am here because i believe that there should be more signs
YOU1000000157_S0000105	well the 1st thing you do not want to do is stop lecturing the judge
YOU1000000157_S0000106	i am sorry
YOU1000000157_S0000107	on what should be done because some judges get very upset
YOU1000000157_S0000108	no it is not your job to do that anyway
YOU1000000157_S0000109	0 good it is not my job
YOU1000000157_S0000110	no
YOU1000000157_S0000112	be careful he is a tough guy
YOU1000000157_S0000114	okay
YOU1000000157_S0000115	he is on the swat team
YOU1000000157_S0000116	1st guys out there with the big guns
YOU1000000157_S0000117	no just concerned about the kids
YOU1000000157_S0000118	0 i see
YOU1000000157_S0000120	let me explain to you what is going on with everybody else
YOU1000000157_S0000122	they just began this system and the 1st wave of summonses that went out there were a whole bunch of them
YOU1000000157_S0000123	that did not indicate the speed limit in the small box where the print is big
YOU1000000157_S0000125	and they indicated the speed limit up at the top of the summons you can not see it you literally need a magnifying glass to see it
YOU1000000157_S0000127	so i have taken the position that the summons was inadequate for the city to prevail there is such a disparity between the power of the individual and the power of the sovereign that they should get it right the 1st time
YOU1000000157_S0000128	i take that
YOU1000000157_S0000129	thank you
YOU1000000157_S0000130	unless it is a crime of moral turpitude then i think and there are other factors involved but these are speeding tickets
YOU1000000157_S0000131	i am not condoning speeding but i think everybody should afford all of their constitutional rights
YOU1000000157_S0000132	thank you
YOU1000000157_S0000133	even though

YOU1000000157_S0000142	okay

YOU1000000159_S0000002	though of course it was not all 10s and gold stars we also rated more games in one year at a 3 or lower that is awful or worse than we have in a while
YOU1000000159_S0000003	so without further ado here are ign is best and worst reviewed games of 2020
YOU1000000159_S0000005	crusader kings 3 is a superb strategy game a great rpg and a masterclass in how to take the best parts of an existing system and make them deeper and better
YOU1000000159_S0000006	i have 1000s of hours in the previous game and i expect to spend at least that many in this 3rd installment
YOU1000000159_S0000007	all of the engrossingly flawed characters and stories of love war triumph and loss that have already dynamically emerged from my playthroughs feel like just the beginning of something legendary
YOU1000000159_S0000008	in fact if i had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life the decision would not be that difficult
YOU1000000159_S0000009	a new king of historical strategy has been crowned long live the king
YOU1000000159_S0000011	back when vr 1st became a real thing and we all started spitballing about which game worlds we would most like to be fully immersed in half life topped my list tied with bioshock
YOU1000000159_S0000012	it took a few years but half life alyx has realized that potential and it is the best vr shooter i have ever played
YOU1000000159_S0000013	with it valve has set a new bar for vr interactivity detail and level design showing what can happen when a world class developer goes all in on the new frontier of technology
YOU1000000159_S0000014	in a lot of ways it feels like a game from the future and one that the rest of vr gaming will likely take a good long while to match much less surpass
YOU1000000159_S0000016	the last of us part ii is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor taking strides forward in nearly every way

YOU1000000159_S0000019	it delivers a layered emotionally shattering story on top of stealth and action gameplay that improves the 1st game is mechanics while integrating a bit more of uncharted is greater mobility and action
YOU1000000159_S0000020	but while part 2 is a thrilling adventure it still makes time for a stunning nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit
YOU1000000159_S0000021	the playstation 4 has one of its finest exclusives in one of the generation is best games
YOU1000000159_S0000023	microsoft flight simulator is legitimately incredible it is difficult to fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and just fly to and from literally any place in the entire world
YOU1000000159_S0000024	the base game is 20 included aircraft feel like more than enough for even hardcore aviation enthusiasts

YOU1000000159_S0000026	the real world mapping data however takes flight simulator from being just an impressive game to the most
YOU1000000159_S0000028	and limitless simulation i have ever experienced

YOU1000000159_S0000031	and an absolutely unparalleled way to virtually explore our world
YOU1000000159_S0000033	overwatch is a one of a kind hero shooter that is far and away the best of its genre it offers variety depth and style that very few come close to matching

YOU1000000159_S0000038	persona 5 was already a strong frontrunner for being the best jrpg ever made and royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete
YOU1000000159_S0000039	the excellent story and its lovable multi dimensional characters along with the challenging tactical combat are all refined and back for another round with new surprises and new friends in tow

YOU1000000159_S0000042	i was not sure what i wanted out of a sequel of spelunky given how high of a pedestal i keep the original game on how do you improve upon a game like that
YOU1000000159_S0000043	but mossmouth took its time and managed to deliver a masterpiece that improves upon its predecessor in ways i never would have even imagined
YOU1000000159_S0000044	spelunky 2 takes everything that made the original great and expands upon each of those individual aspects without ever overcomplicating the elegant retro simplicity of its 2 d platforming
YOU1000000159_S0000045	the possibilities for interactions between yourself your enemies and the environment are virtually limitless
YOU1000000159_S0000046	which is a part of what makes every new run in spelunky 2 so unpredictable and exciting it does not do much to win over the people who already were not fans of the original is unforgiving difficulty but as someone who is more than 200 runs in
YOU1000000159_S0000048	and feels like he is only scratched the surface spelunky 2 is a game that i see myself playing for a long long time
YOU1000000159_S0000050	man those were great of course there is no alpha without the omega so .
YOU1000000159_S0000051	cooking mama cookstar is bogged down by monotony poor motion controls and nightmarish voice acting while also having practically nothing new to offer
YOU1000000159_S0000052	whether it is the lack of consequences for failure the incessantly obnoxious mama the bland cooking minigames the lackluster multiplayer modes or the complete absence of meaningful progression
YOU1000000159_S0000053	cooking mama cookstar is a tedious game that does almost nothing well
YOU1000000159_S0000054	going into final fantasy crystal chronicles remastered edition we expected a fair amount of old school design and were not surprised to find that the story had been altered
YOU1000000159_S0000055	but we never anticipated it would be in such a frustratingly poor technical state on playstation 4
YOU1000000159_S0000056	unacceptable load times lack of local co op and an arcane matchmaking system makes playing final fantasy crystal chronicles a chore
YOU1000000159_S0000057	a few simple quality of life improvements even if it was just the removal or shortening of load times would have gone a long way to gloss over at least some of crystal chronicles shortcomings when compared to many other dungeon crawlers you can play in 2020
YOU1000000159_S0000058	unfortunately the old school frustrations that were not addressed only serve to date everything else about it almost completely depriving it of any sort of fun
YOU1000000159_S0000059	we will be uninstalling it as soon as possible and never looking back
YOU1000000159_S0000061	aside from up to date squads this season is kits and a new start screen fifa 21 on switch is virtually unchanged from fifa 20
YOU1000000159_S0000062	which was virtually unchanged from fifa 19 before it and outrageously priced at $49.99 or £44.99 if last year is release was borderline insulting
YOU1000000159_S0000063	this year is is just plain disgraceful ea please do better
YOU1000000159_S0000065	under no circumstances should you play waking if you want guided meditation there is plenty of free apps for phones and videos on youtube
YOU1000000159_S0000066	if you want to play as souls like there is plenty out there including actual souls games if you need a game with psychic powers control is a lot of fun
YOU1000000159_S0000067	avoid this at all costs and do almost literally anything else with your time
YOU1000000159_S0000069	yeah we are going to try our best to forget about those for more good games though be sure to check out all our picks for the best games of 2020 or if you want to look ahead have a look at all the big games slated for release in 2021
YOU1000000159_S0000070	for more on gaming is good bad and everything in between you are already in the right place here at ign
YOU1000000160_S0000000	the console wars are entering a whole new era in 2020 as we move on to the next generation of gaming and a massive tech giant enters the picture
YOU1000000160_S0000001	but as a gamer what new console do you choose or do you pick them all
YOU1000000160_S0000002	well we made the choice even easier for you today as we pit the ps 5 up against the xbox 2 and the google stadia in the ultimate battle of console domination
YOU1000000160_S0000003	this is not just about brand loyalty as we break down gaming choices features graphics and online interaction to determine the ultimate winner
YOU1000000160_S0000005	graphics comparisons 4 k graphics are the new standard in gaming and this is the bare minimum that will be supplied by all 3 consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000006	the one caveat internet speed playing a detail rich game like assassin is creed origins could look very different at one home using stadia compared to another
YOU1000000160_S0000007	the google stadia uses variable graphic performance based solely on internet speed
YOU1000000160_S0000008	so if your parents are binge watching netflix while your little sister jams out to spotify you could easily find yourself playing a game at 720 p with stereo sound instead of being maxed out at 4 k graphics with hdr video and 5 one surround sound
YOU1000000160_S0000009	the ps 5 and xbox 2 will rely on disks and downloads to provide a consistent quality for a lot of the games
YOU1000000160_S0000010	besides the 4 k quality each of the 3 consoles also aim to provide 60 frames per 2nd as a standard for a majority of the game
YOU1000000160_S0000011	in simple terms character movements are going to look incredibly smooth things like car races are going to be fluid and all those 1st person shooters will be even better than you could imagine
YOU1000000160_S0000012	another way these consoles are all improving on the graphical presentation with ray tracing
YOU1000000160_S0000013	the lighting technique includes extremely vivid graphics and will make everything from reflections to shadows look even more realistic than they already are
YOU1000000160_S0000014	all in all each console is pretty much on par with each other in the graphics department with the ps 5 and xbox 2 taking a slight edge because of stadia is reliance on proper internet speeds
YOU1000000160_S0000015	the controllers what are good graphics without a good controller to enjoy those games with the ps 5 and xbox 2 both have a history of controllers their gamers are used to
YOU1000000160_S0000016	while you can expect more of the same from xbox with their pro controller sony is making vast improvements for their next entry in the dualshock controller
YOU1000000160_S0000017	one of the biggest features is a major upgrade in the rumble technology and the adaptive nature of the analog stacks
YOU1000000160_S0000018	no longer will the controller just play out a random rumble or buzz while you play
YOU1000000160_S0000019	everything reacts to the surroundings you are in if you are an undercover agent who must climb their way through a snowy mountainside you will feel the struggle of each footstep as you move the analog stick around
YOU1000000160_S0000020	driving a vehicle on a beach instead of the road you will feel the difference as you travel through sand as opposed to the paved road
YOU1000000160_S0000021	on top of that the trigger buttons on top of the newest dualshock controller are more sensitive than ever
YOU1000000160_S0000022	blasting your way through levels with a laser gun will feel very different than playing as batman and throwing a batarang and the pressure you place on the trigger will indicate the speed and force rather than just button mashing
YOU1000000160_S0000023	google stadia is not trying to reinvent the wheel with their controller either knowing what works the stadia controller features dual analog sticks the typical input buttons and multiple triggers on top
YOU1000000160_S0000024	if the dualshock controller works without any major problems or glitches then the ps 5 edges out the competition for the innovative nature of their design
YOU1000000160_S0000025	cloud game services and speaking of cloud based gaming google stadia is not the only one providing this streaming service
YOU1000000160_S0000026	besides their typical game releases and digital downloads both sony and microsoft have their own subscription based streaming game services
YOU1000000160_S0000027	the xbox game pass is priced at $10 a month and features over 100 games with a rotating title of options including console classics
YOU1000000160_S0000028	the xcloud service microsoft runs on looks to expand the game pass to all types of ios and android devices in the near future
YOU1000000160_S0000029	the playstation now service has an affordable option if players are willing to pay for a whole year up front
YOU1000000160_S0000030	while the base price starts at $9.99 per month a whole year costs around $60 which equals out to $5 a month
YOU1000000160_S0000031	the ps 5 will be one of the best ways to enjoy the service with a huge library of past games from the ps 2 ps 3 and ps 4 all rolled into one
YOU1000000160_S0000032	the cloud based service also includes pc gaming through the ps now app the pricing discounts give the playstation cloud streaming a huge plus
YOU1000000160_S0000033	but the xbox game pass does have some exclusive rights to minecraft so there is that it is a little hard to compare stadia is options until the service fully rolls out but there will be a free plan
YOU1000000160_S0000034	allowing gamers to hop on any google device and play the pro plan will include a number of free monthly gaming options as well solid state hard drives
YOU1000000160_S0000035	the insides of both the xbox 2 and ps 5 will show a major improvement with solid state hard drives
YOU1000000160_S0000036	the massive improvement was years in the making and the more affordable hard drives will be a game changer in many ways
YOU1000000160_S0000037	load times will be virtually non existent and the struggles of saving hard drive space will be gone as well with a solid state drive gamers do not need to download the whole game to play
YOU1000000160_S0000038	not interested in the single player campaign just download the multiplayer element of the game and be on your merry way
YOU1000000160_S0000039	not only will you be able to save hard drive space but the anticipation of playing a game will not take hours and hours
YOU1000000160_S0000040	on the google side of things even though the stadia platform will be available through the chromecast ultra and chromebooks there are no downloads needed everything will be cloud based
YOU1000000160_S0000041	saving some hard drive space and reducing loading times as google is high speed servers provide all the loading and space you need for a whole library of games
YOU1000000160_S0000043	game streams in today is gaming world does it even count that you have played a game if your epic skills or epic fails were not captured in some sort of game stream
YOU1000000160_S0000044	well that is pretty much the case and live game stream focus has been an emphasis for all the next general consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000045	microsoft is getting pretty serious about their online streaming platform mixer
YOU1000000160_S0000046	the newest competitor to twitch will be integrated directly into the xbox too making it easy for players to hop online and broadcast their live streams
YOU1000000160_S0000047	a picture in picture format also allows players to watch mixer streams while they play their own games plus ninja has joined the mixer party giving the whole service a lot of legitimacy and fanfare
YOU1000000160_S0000048	i will be streaming exclusively on mixer
YOU1000000160_S0000049	sony does not have their own streaming service but twitch is readily available for the console and will likely make the same transition with the ps 5
YOU1000000160_S0000050	meanwhile the powerhouse of google has one of the most popular video streaming websites at its fingertips in the form of youtube
YOU1000000160_S0000051	with a capture button featured on the stadia controller players will easily be able to sort out content
YOU1000000160_S0000052	upload footage and create all types of stadia youtube content the youtube integration is huge for stadia but the xbox mixer service may edge them all out
YOU1000000160_S0000053	ninja has garnered a ton of press for his switch and by the time the xbox 2 gets released the platform could have an even larger viewing audience
YOU1000000160_S0000054	online play with cloud based games huge downloads and an emphasis on services like xbox live and playstation plus online gaming will be bigger than ever in the next generation of consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000055	and google has announced some pretty innovative changes that will help set the stadia apart the 1st is the buddy pass sick of having a friend who does not have the online subscription you want to play with
YOU1000000160_S0000056	well just gift them one with a buddy pass anyone who signs up for stadia is founders package will be allowed to give someone a buddy pass for 3 months
YOU1000000160_S0000057	and that player can reap all the benefits another feature that helps the stadia stand out above the rest the crowd play feature
YOU1000000160_S0000058	enjoying your favorite streamer in a popular multiplayer game well the crowdplay feature allows you to hop in on their actual game giving gamers a chance to play with some of their favorites
YOU1000000160_S0000059	for ps 5 and xbox 2 expect more of the same not that it is a bad thing but google is major changes could lead to some new innovations for both microsoft and sony
YOU1000000160_S0000060	give one to the new guy because google is online play definitely piques a lot of interest enjoying the battle so far
YOU1000000160_S0000061	well be sure to check out our video 10 worst gaming injuries when you are done
YOU1000000160_S0000062	free games who does not love free games well we are here to give you a breakdown of all the best free options for each of the next general consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000063	google is on the short end of the stick here as they rely on players making full game purchases rather than offering a whole lot of free titles
YOU1000000160_S0000064	so far the only free game packaged with the stadia premiere edition is destiny 2 the collection
YOU1000000160_S0000065	meanwhile you can expect both playstation +and xbox gold to continue rolling out their free game options
YOU1000000160_S0000066	the free games have been a huge highlight paying the monthly subscriptions on both systems and removing the feature would likely result in a lot less subscribers
YOU1000000160_S0000067	the free game feature is an ideal way for 3rd party and independent publishers to showcase a variety of their games and gives players an easy way to build up their library
YOU1000000160_S0000068	google definitely has a lot of catching up to do in the free game department but the company is also working on publishing their own games
YOU1000000160_S0000069	so there could be some major changes and more access to games down the line
YOU1000000160_S0000070	backwards compatibility google is the little baby among the bunch unless they decide to connect to services like epic games or steam do not expect a huge back library of game downloads and backwards compatibility
YOU1000000160_S0000071	meanwhile microsoft and sony will continue to honor their faithful making you want to dust off some disks in the long run
YOU1000000160_S0000072	sony will allow any ps 4 disk to work on the console giving players a lot of time to stack up on games over the next year
YOU1000000160_S0000073	meanwhile the xbox 2 might as well be called the xbox legacy because the console really blows all the others out of the park with its physical disk compatibility
YOU1000000160_S0000074	the console will be able to read every single xbox game from the original console all the way up to the xbox one
YOU1000000160_S0000075	this is a huge feature and will likely have us on ebay snatching up old games we used to love
YOU1000000160_S0000076	needless to say but the xbox 2 has the major advantage in this category other forms of media
YOU1000000160_S0000077	while we all love our hours and hours of gaming marathons consoles have become a lot more than just gaming machines so let us take a look at some of the extras
YOU1000000160_S0000078	anyone who purchases the stadia premiere edition will get a chromecast ultra the hdmi device which offers streaming access to 100s of different channels along with some live tv options like sling
YOU1000000160_S0000079	naturally both the xbox and playstation will continue their wide range of streaming channels like netflix hulu and newer options like disney
YOU1000000160_S0000080	on the xbox side of things the exclusive nfl content will help draw in sports fans meanwhile sony continues to promote their live tv service playstation view
YOU1000000160_S0000081	the view is available on multiple devices making it an option for when the ps 5 is not in use
YOU1000000160_S0000082	expect the expansion of the view service on the ps 5 with some possible added features and extra content
YOU1000000160_S0000083	no matter what type of video streams you enjoy all the consoles are pretty much equal in this category release dates
YOU1000000160_S0000084	okay now that we all know about the newest consoles it is pretty much a race to the finish line to see which ones will get released 1st
YOU1000000160_S0000085	well google has a head start as the premiere edition of stadia will roll out in november although there has been some major delays due to the pre orders selling out across the globe
YOU1000000160_S0000086	that stadia is launching this year 2019
YOU1000000160_S0000088	no matter when the various forms google stadia pre orders do arrive it will be months in advance of the ps 5 and xbox 2
YOU1000000160_S0000089	the sony and microsoft consoles are set for a holiday 2020 launch date giving google plenty of time to work out the kinks build up on the hype and allow stadia to become a household name
YOU1000000160_S0000090	the latest rumor points to the sony ps 5 getting released on december 4th 2020 just in time to place a big ol box under the christmas tree
YOU1000000160_S0000091	let us just say that christmas break 2020 will be filled with a whole lot of games wow what a battle between some juggernauts
YOU1000000160_S0000092	the cloud service streaming definitely limits stadia is presence in the console wars but the ability to play on a pixel 4 also changes gaming forever
YOU1000000160_S0000093	microsoft and sony are sure making some major improvements but time will only tell when people finally get some hands on action with the consoles
YOU1000000160_S0000094	either way we are all excited for the next generation of gaming
YOU1000000160_S0000095	and now it is your turn which console has impressed you the most so far what features are you looking forward to anything great we missed
YOU1000000160_S0000096	well let us know in the comments and stick around the gamer for more great video game content

YOU1000000161_S0000091	i noticed you reacted really strongly to it i knew what was coming i am stirred up
YOU1000000161_S0000092	i am stirred up right now
YOU1000000161_S0000093	look at that
YOU1000000161_S0000094	
YOU1000000161_S0000095	love this pair
YOU1000000161_S0000096	it is like a little bit of everything they are working on and yet it looks like a complete package
YOU1000000161_S0000097	it does look like a shoe
YOU1000000161_S0000098	it looks .
YOU1000000161_S0000099	and look at this
YOU1000000161_S0000101	cardboard stick i am enjoying this
YOU1000000161_S0000102	number 5
YOU1000000161_S0000104	i like the shoe though this silver tongue though hey
YOU1000000161_S0000105	do not like this detail
YOU1000000161_S0000106	it sounds like you are not a fan of the jumpman
YOU1000000161_S0000107	it is hard to look at these
YOU1000000161_S0000109	look at this
YOU1000000161_S0000111	the lacing opportunities
YOU1000000161_S0000112	a lot of options i feel like it was in the make it your way era where everyone wanted to customize
YOU1000000161_S0000113	i think burger king led the way then have it your way yeah they were telling everyone that they could have it their way
YOU1000000161_S0000115	and this piggy backed on it
YOU1000000161_S0000117	that is probably not true do you think the pace of this is going okay
YOU1000000161_S0000118	i just feel like we are taking should we speed it up
YOU1000000161_S0000119	3 minutes per shoot times 18 that is 54 minutes we are looking at an hour long video
YOU1000000161_S0000121	i feel like i did not do that well
YOU1000000161_S0000122	things have obviously changed at this point i think the world is transitioning they want things to look more high tech
YOU1000000161_S0000123	this is the varsity red colorway leather feels nice though
YOU1000000161_S0000125	what is this is this a dryer sheet
YOU1000000161_S0000127	this is a good one
YOU1000000161_S0000128	yeah maybe the greatest year in michael jordan is career
YOU1000000161_S0000129	look at that i prefer looking at the monitor than seeing them in real life actually look at that
YOU1000000161_S0000130	i feel like they have kind of tamed a little bit from the last one with the unusual color here but that is because
YOU1000000161_S0000131	olympics
YOU1000000161_S0000132	the olympics michael wins his 3rd mvp award his 6th nba scoring title the finals mvp award his 2nd nba championship and his 2nd olympic gold medal
YOU1000000161_S0000133	that is in one year 1992 mvp of the league scoring title finals mvp nba championship and olympic gold one year
YOU1000000161_S0000135	that is a special shoe should i wear these
YOU1000000161_S0000136	i think you should put these on
YOU1000000161_S0000137	right now
YOU1000000161_S0000138	alright now push push
YOU1000000161_S0000139	i feel like i am the luckiest 12 year old right now

YOU1000000161_S0000142	i think we are back to a lot going on
YOU1000000161_S0000143	yeah yeah maybe too much
YOU1000000161_S0000144	i like them if i am in the mood for something chunky
YOU1000000161_S0000145	right that is a commitment
YOU1000000161_S0000146	this is a lot of lockdown
YOU1000000161_S0000147	look at the sparkling in there
YOU1000000161_S0000148	it does not come together
YOU1000000161_S0000149	yeah okay
YOU1000000161_S0000150	it is like you like peanut butter you like jelly but you also like lettuce and those do not go together
YOU1000000161_S0000151	i could not have said it any better number 9
YOU1000000161_S0000152	number 9 let us get it centered in the shot the cue back
YOU1000000161_S0000153	sorry i just noticed you were in the shot should we start over he was in the shoe
YOU1000000161_S0000155	stay back do we have an extra light that it is just dark are we rolling on this
YOU1000000161_S0000157	not a fan
YOU1000000161_S0000159	he is not a fan we are going to we are just going to keep moving
YOU1000000161_S0000161	things are getting better now we are back in the realm now whoa
YOU1000000161_S0000163	you can not talk about the 10 without talking about this soul talk about history you are wearing it on your feet
YOU1000000161_S0000164	92 mvp championship 93 mvp championship 94 beyond
YOU1000000161_S0000165	we are now back in the realm of that number 4
YOU1000000161_S0000166	i totally disagree i like that it is just a little bit of color kind of seeping
YOU1000000161_S0000167	yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000168	little blue teasing you on the rim and you just want to get in there and see what is down there
YOU1000000161_S0000170	nothing else they are not too flashy
YOU1000000161_S0000171	no
YOU1000000161_S0000172	i think i know what is coming next because they are numbered and we just hit 10
YOU1000000161_S0000174	this is a different unboxing experience look at this you can start to tell right away you get the little claws going on these are number 11 but they are not just any 11
YOU1000000161_S0000175	check that out looney tunes we are talking about the space jam shoot look at the reflection there on that
YOU1000000161_S0000177	i love it
YOU1000000161_S0000178	something is going to get you fired up this has got to be it
YOU1000000161_S0000179	i am so fired up right now
YOU1000000161_S0000180	something happened here
YOU1000000161_S0000181	this is the 1st carbon fiber
YOU1000000161_S0000183	i think this is the 1st sneaker in the group that i pulled out of the box and i feel like something happened
YOU1000000161_S0000184	i feel like i want to just give you a moment with me
YOU1000000161_S0000185	let me have a moment
YOU1000000161_S0000187	want any water mama
YOU1000000161_S0000189	see when you talk about telling a story you talk about a shoe that has got a something attached to it we said history earlier
YOU1000000161_S0000190	of course this one the year jordan went off to make space jam the whole baseball thing the number 45 temporarily
YOU1000000161_S0000191	when you see this sneaker there is so much more that comes to mind
YOU1000000161_S0000193	no
YOU1000000161_S0000195	i did not necessarily think i would have this type of emotional reaction to this particular shoe but it is happening right now
YOU1000000161_S0000197	a magic trick
YOU1000000161_S0000199	i had these shoes as a kid man that is something
YOU1000000161_S0000200	i love this pair
YOU1000000161_S0000201	wow
YOU1000000161_S0000203	that is a distinctive look without being overwhelming
YOU1000000161_S0000204	this comes together nicely
YOU1000000161_S0000205	you notice details but from a distance it is a package you see the complexity
YOU1000000161_S0000207	great contrast just like there
YOU1000000161_S0000209	low tops
YOU1000000161_S0000210	
YOU1000000161_S0000211	not my favorite
YOU1000000161_S0000212	looking at it on its own you can see the inside of the shoe on the other side
YOU1000000161_S0000213	that is what it looks like if your foot were in it
YOU1000000161_S0000214	that is actually that works
YOU1000000161_S0000216	rolls over easy this way but this way
YOU1000000161_S0000218	can not roll over
YOU1000000161_S0000219	i think of the jordans as tied to his career we still have one highlight left
YOU1000000161_S0000221	same model he wore for his last shot just a different colorway i love reliving that seeing him sync that shot unusual tongue
YOU1000000161_S0000222	maybe the weirdest tongue we have seen it certainly looks kind of like what they thought was futuristic at the time
YOU1000000161_S0000223	a jetson of shoes
YOU1000000161_S0000224	that is right
YOU1000000161_S0000225	like i am robot
YOU1000000161_S0000226	they are not my favorite yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000227	i do like this pair
YOU1000000161_S0000229	what happened it is like i just said it is what happened
YOU1000000161_S0000231	this one i think it is now coming into its own
YOU1000000161_S0000232	for real 16 this thing is removable right
YOU1000000161_S0000234	this is not that bad there is something happening with the this is not that bad
YOU1000000161_S0000236	i like these without the shrouds
YOU1000000161_S0000237	yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000238	i worried that i would trip over this or lose it
YOU1000000161_S0000239	17
YOU1000000161_S0000241	i do not know how to feel about these this to me feels more like a nike shoe than a jordan
YOU1000000161_S0000242	this one feels like some kind of a dress shoot to me
YOU1000000161_S0000243	this stuff on the back yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000244	he likes going from the court to the boardroom
YOU1000000161_S0000245	well said
YOU1000000161_S0000246	thank you
YOU1000000161_S0000247	i do not like this shoe actually this was the hardest one to find by the way this came from somebody is personal collection
YOU1000000161_S0000249	hardest to get open too
YOU1000000161_S0000250	no that is it that is as far as it goes
YOU1000000161_S0000251	no
YOU1000000161_S0000252	yeah
YOU1000000161_S0000253	i can get it out further
YOU1000000161_S0000255	i will do it later
YOU1000000161_S0000256	i do not even this is i do not even it is unfortunate
YOU1000000161_S0000257	
YOU1000000161_S0000258	this is the end though
YOU1000000161_S0000259	maybe we wish he retired earlier to be honest
YOU1000000161_S0000260	this is the moment right now where we each select our favorite out of the bunch i mean we just unboxed 18 different jordans here
YOU1000000161_S0000261	who better than us to tell you which is the best you go 1st
YOU1000000161_S0000262	okay michael or jordan one it is the beginning i just love this shoe in an adult size
YOU1000000161_S0000263	it is a great shoe it is a classic look i see where you are coming from the funny thing about this entire experience has been the less desirable shoes have been the hardest to find
YOU1000000161_S0000264	the collecting part of it is only half the thing like some people want to wear this history
YOU1000000161_S0000265	for me there is something about this package right here which just screams of a very particular era
YOU1000000161_S0000266	this gives me positive vibes there is a confidence here this is iconic to me
YOU1000000161_S0000267	they all are in a way
YOU1000000161_S0000268	they all are in the world that is up there too out of the destruction of that time period this emerged
YOU1000000161_S0000269	i do not know about that
YOU1000000161_S0000271	so there you have it every game warden jordan unboxed here thanks to my friend brad hall
YOU1000000161_S0000272	thank you this was fun
YOU1000000162_S0000000	so i made a video recently about the apple airpods they came back into my life i have been using the airpods and kind of enjoying it
YOU1000000162_S0000002	they are wildly successful you see them out in the world other manufacturers they are entering the space
YOU1000000162_S0000003	this is the latest incarnation of the fully wireless samsung earbud product
YOU1000000162_S0000004	it has a couple of features that have not been seen before probably my favorite one is the fact that this entire setup
YOU1000000162_S0000005	can charge from any phone that supports wireless charge sharing because this is a samsung product and this is a samsung phone
YOU1000000162_S0000006	there is also some interplay there that is a bit smoother than it might otherwise be with a 3rd party pair of earpods earpods
YOU1000000162_S0000007	but once you are into the app this is where i think they have a bit of an advantage over the airpods they are super configurable
YOU1000000162_S0000008	here we can see the battery life of each individual unit you can use one independently of the other
YOU1000000162_S0000009	you can keep one of these guys charging in the case while listening to the other one
YOU1000000162_S0000010	there is some different equalizer settings here for a bass boost soft dynamic clear and so on
YOU1000000162_S0000011	you can manage how these things deal with notifications they do have touchpads on the side unlike the airpods
YOU1000000162_S0000012	these have interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks as well look at all those options
YOU1000000162_S0000013	the airpod you have seen it before does not fit that far into the ear canal for some people this fits really well others it will not stay in their ears
YOU1000000162_S0000014	these on the other hand are going to be a bit more predictable because they sit further in the ear canal and they have that secondary rubber plasticky component
YOU1000000162_S0000015	they should just be a bit more secure in there considering the way that they are designed
YOU1000000162_S0000016	the airpod is a bit taller but also slightly less chunky than the galaxy bud
YOU1000000162_S0000017	so people want to know hey which one should i get considering that you can use either on multiple platforms
YOU1000000162_S0000018	if you work as bluetooth headsets you could use the airpods on android you could use the galaxy buds on ios
YOU1000000162_S0000019	within the app there is also a find my earbuds button so that will track these down these things could be pretty easy to lose i mean they are tiny
YOU1000000162_S0000020	also there is a pretty cool ambient sound option i can actually elevate the volume of the ambient sound the sound around me
YOU1000000162_S0000021	so it will be amplified into my ears so i can hear my surroundings while i am listening to music podcast audiobook and so on
YOU1000000162_S0000022	now you can toggle that all the way down so that it is muted and what is going on around me is muted
YOU1000000162_S0000023	you can have ambient if you are on the bike you are cycling you need to hear if a car honks its horn or something this can really amplify your surroundings
YOU1000000162_S0000024	of course it is not on the airpods there is also a voice focus feature in there so this looks for voices specifically
YOU1000000162_S0000025	and allows them to cut through that particular frequency range i find this to be useful from time to time
YOU1000000162_S0000026	now the way that the touchpad works you can tap to play or pause a track double tap to play the next track answer or end a phone call
YOU1000000162_S0000027	triple tap to play the previous track and touch and hold to use a user configurable user is choice
YOU1000000162_S0000028	you could have that launch something specifically do something specifically and that is user configurable that is nice
YOU1000000162_S0000029	now that i have it for quick ambient sound i am going to touch and hold and see if i can lighten up the surroundings here we go
YOU1000000162_S0000031	wow that is cool it toggles ambient mode while you are holding your finger on the touchpad i am in ambient right now i can totally hear my conversation hear my own voice now do i look a little strange doing this quite possibly
YOU1000000162_S0000032	but the question you all have is like how do they stack up against the airpods now as you guys know i am an s 10 user this is the device that is currently in my pocket
YOU1000000162_S0000033	so the effectiveness of either of these earbuds it has to be in correlation to this particular device
YOU1000000162_S0000034	we talked about some advantages within the app who knows i might be willing to give up those extra features in exchange for potentially better sound i am not really sure
YOU1000000162_S0000035	we will start with the galaxy buds i want to make sure i have got maximum volume okay so now i know i have got max volume a little sample
YOU1000000162_S0000036	
YOU1000000162_S0000038	okay
YOU1000000162_S0000040	now we are in soft right now dynamic clear bass
YOU1000000162_S0000042	
YOU1000000162_S0000044	okay i am wondering right now if the people that have tested these already had them in full volume or not
YOU1000000162_S0000045	cause i read some of those things that you read and that was the experience i was having until i made sure the buds themselves were max volume and the phone was max volume
YOU1000000162_S0000046	now it is a lot more thump way more bass are people doing it wrong
YOU1000000162_S0000048	it is a headphone i am hearing instruments i was gone for a minute did the trick sort of i have heard better i kinda feel like i got to do this exact same track right now on the airpods
YOU1000000162_S0000049	right now without further ado hurry up hurry up hurry up way less isolation i hear the the fan on the camera here we go beginning
YOU1000000162_S0000050	you know neither are blowing my brains out you know obviously i have tried some very expensive headphones in this spot in this seat right here
YOU1000000162_S0000051	we have done it together you and i jack kirk and whoever else happens to be behind me on any given day these are tiny dental floss situations look at them
YOU1000000162_S0000052	in terms of sound i think i can say based on that quick little test right there the buds
YOU1000000162_S0000054	there is a bit more thump to it maybe my expectations were too high
YOU1000000162_S0000055	they are probably closer to this performance than they are to like a full on pair of headphone performance
YOU1000000162_S0000056	that said the most striking difference for me between the 2 is the fit and the feel right
YOU1000000162_S0000057	and the sound seal when you put these on you feel isolated but there is a drawback to that i noticed they are in my ears a little bit more
YOU1000000162_S0000058	this i do not even feel it this is a kind of a tighter feel if i had to choose this is a bit more comfortable for my particular ear canal
YOU1000000162_S0000059	and that is part of the reason i think i keep reaching for the airpods in the 1st place not because they sound the best but because you just do not even notice you are wearing them that could be a good thing or a bad thing
YOU1000000162_S0000060	neither are going to be an amazing audio experience but really these products are about convenience
YOU1000000162_S0000061	so evaluating them on convenience you have to give certain points to the new samsung product because of the fact that it can charge wirelessly and off of the phone itself
YOU1000000162_S0000062	also the app gives you more configurability also another thing worth noting the galaxy buds are a bit cheaper than the airpods
YOU1000000162_S0000063	so that is not much of a surprise that is a hard pick i really do not know i mean it might be so simple as if you are on samsung or on android you might go for these and if
YOU1000000162_S0000064	if you are on ios you will probably go for these just for the easier pairing across devices
YOU1000000162_S0000065	0 it is a hard decision i would say if i am about to do some kind of physical activity if i am going for a jog or something i do not jog but like let us say i did
YOU1000000162_S0000066	i will probably reach for these ones it is just a bit more confidence in the fit but if it is just if it is in an environment like around the house
YOU1000000162_S0000067	i actually really like the idea of not feeling the thing in your ear as stupid as that looks you forget that it is there
YOU1000000162_S0000068	i already have so many great sounding headphones if i want to get down to business with music i think i will probably still reach for these more because of that factor
YOU1000000162_S0000069	and then also keep my sony headphones the dedicated over ear headphones with the noise cancellation and everything else
YOU1000000162_S0000070	keep those for the discerning listening but if i did not have those other headphones and i needed something that could isolate better than the airpods
YOU1000000162_S0000071	and i could only have one pair i only had 130 bucks for one pair i would probably go for these
YOU1000000162_S0000072	so only on one pair of headphones i probably would choose these over these but in conjunction with a really nice pair that you use sometimes
YOU1000000162_S0000073	this is the i do not even notice i am wearing them headset that is the bottom line
YOU1000000163_S0000000	okay so back in december 2018 we made a video on one of the best options in terms of smartwatches for android users and that was this watch the mobvoi ticwatch pro
YOU1000000163_S0000001	and what was really unique about this smartwatch was that it actually came with not one but 2 displays
YOU1000000163_S0000002	yes one of them being an fstn panel and thanks to this dual display technology the battery life was absolutely insane
YOU1000000163_S0000003	so up to 30 days on a smartwatch which was something that has never been done before
YOU1000000163_S0000004	it came with the best specs you could get on a smartwatch today
YOU1000000163_S0000005	at an incredible price of just over £200
YOU1000000163_S0000006	if you want to check out the full video on the ticwatch pro you can find it here
YOU1000000163_S0000007	but now mobvoi has released a brand new smartwatch for 2019 it is called the ticwatch e 2
YOU1000000163_S0000008	and not only comes with some extra features even over the pro but it is also even less expensive than the pro
YOU1000000163_S0000009	starting at just £145
YOU1000000163_S0000010	and mobvoi has sent one over as well as sponsored this video for me to take a look at
YOU1000000163_S0000011	so let us see how good this watch really is for just $160
YOU1000000163_S0000012	or £145 is it actually worth it i am quite curious
YOU1000000163_S0000013	so grab some snacks and let us have a look
YOU1000000163_S0000015	okay so inside the box we get the watch itself the quick start guide as well as the charger
YOU1000000163_S0000016	now with most android smartwatches the charger has those charging pins and you have to line up manually the watch with the pins which i really do not like
YOU1000000163_S0000017	now with the e 2 while the charger does have those pins the charger itself is actually magnetic so it automatically lines itself up
YOU1000000163_S0000018	with the watch okay so who is the ticwatch e 2 for and what does it do and in the end is it is it really worth it
YOU1000000163_S0000019	well starting off with who this is for while the ticwatch pro was mobvoi is highest end smartwatch made out of stainless steel and with a 30 day battery life the e 2 was actually made with fitness and swimming in mind
YOU1000000163_S0000020	okay so it has weaker specs than the pro but it is better for swimming and fitness right
YOU1000000163_S0000021	well to my surprise the e 2 actually has the exact same specs as the more expensive ticwatch pro and in some cases it even offers more than the pro does
YOU1000000163_S0000022	for example even though the e 2 does not offer the same dual display technology as the pro does it does have the exact same display the main display as the pro
YOU1000000163_S0000023	so this is a one.4 inch amoled display at 400 x 400 pixels in resolution which at the moment is actually the highest resolution display on any android smartwatch so text is razor sharp on this
YOU1000000163_S0000024	colors just pop so everything is very vibrant on this display and since this is an amoled panel you do not just get those perfect black levels but you also get
YOU1000000163_S0000025	yes and always on display which if you are coming from something like an apple watch this is a very very welcome addition
YOU1000000163_S0000026	you know being able to see the time all the time on your display
YOU1000000163_S0000027	and the brightness is really good as well so i have not had any issues reading this in bright sunlight outdoors so yeah overall this is a great display
YOU1000000163_S0000028	in fact this is the best panel that you can get at the moment on any android smartwatch today
YOU1000000163_S0000029	and the ticwatch a 2 actually has it at just $160
YOU1000000163_S0000030	and interesting enough it is not just the display that is great the specs are really good as well
YOU1000000163_S0000031	we get a qualcomm snapdragon wear 2100 processor which yes it is unfortunately not the newly released 3100 processor
YOU1000000163_S0000032	but considering its price points and the fact that there are almost no smartwatches using the 3100 processors yet
YOU1000000163_S0000033	aside from 3 watches the montblanc summit ii the fossil general 4 sport and the louis vuitton tambour horizon 2nd general
YOU1000000163_S0000034	so yeah the 2100 is the best you could ask for at this price the a 2 also comes with 512 mb of ram
YOU1000000163_S0000035	as well as 4 gb of internal storage so add this to the 2100 processor and the 400 x 400 pixel one.4 inch amoled display and there you go you have flagship level specs
YOU1000000163_S0000036	on an android smartwatch and something that is actually priced extremely extremely competitive
YOU1000000163_S0000037	and performance wise i personally have not had any issues at all with yee 2 so menus were fluid risk detection happened in pretty much an instant
YOU1000000163_S0000038	apps opened very quickly and activating the google assistant was very fast
YOU1000000163_S0000039	as well so yeah performance wise the e 2 gets my seal of approval
YOU1000000163_S0000040	and since the 2 comes with google is operating system so wear os 2 out of the box you get the exact same features as you would with all the other premium android smartwatches
YOU1000000163_S0000041	you get access to google is full wear os play store you get access to 1000s of 3rd party watch faces and you can even make your own
YOU1000000163_S0000042	if you have not found one that you really like so yeah you can create your own custom watch faces if you choose to do so so i really really like this feature which is missing from you know something like the apple watch
YOU1000000163_S0000043	and speaking of watch faces there are 3 of them that were made by mobvoi and come pre installed on the ticwatch e 2 and i really really love the way they look so they have this minimalistic look
YOU1000000163_S0000044	with red black and white so yeah they are really nice nicely designed and i do love all of them
YOU1000000163_S0000045	navigating through the menus is also very easy by the way and intuitive so you swipe up to access your notifications you swipe down to access your control toggles for things such as brightness
YOU1000000163_S0000046	low battery mode airplane mode and so on do not disturb so yeah pretty much just like on your smartphone then you swipe right to access the google assistant cards
YOU1000000163_S0000047	so things such as the current weather your plane tickets your latest news all that will be there so yeah very similar experience to google now
YOU1000000163_S0000048	then you swipe left to open up the fitness panel that shows you your steps and calories that you have burned
YOU1000000163_S0000050	from the day and tapping on this opens up a dedicated ticwatch workouts app
YOU1000000163_S0000051	and finally pressing on the crown opens up the app menu so this is where you can access your 3rd party apps and system settings
YOU1000000163_S0000052	and then holding on the crown activates the google assistant which you can also activate by using your voice by you know saying just the commands ok google
YOU1000000163_S0000053	i am not going to hopefully i have not activated your devices but yeah you can start asking questions or ask for directions
YOU1000000163_S0000054	wetter all that so it is just like using google assistant on your smartphone
YOU1000000163_S0000055	okay so great display great performance but what does the e 2 do more over other android smartwatches aside from the very low price
YOU1000000163_S0000056	well many other android smartwatches today are water resistant for example the ticwatch pro was ip 68 certified so up to one.5 meters submersion up to 30 minutes
YOU1000000163_S0000057	but the e 2 is a bit of a special one because this is one of the very very few smartwatches that are actually waterproof not water resistant but waterproof
YOU1000000163_S0000058	so the e 2 is waterproof up to 5 atmospheres of pressure which is about 50 meters of depth
YOU1000000163_S0000059	so same as with an apple watch series 2 or newer you can take this with you when you are swimming or even snorkeling yes up to 50 meters
YOU1000000163_S0000060	so that is pretty impressive especially at this price and e 2 even comes with its own built in exercise app the workouts app that i mentioned before
YOU1000000163_S0000061	which does include a swimming mode so now you can track your pace the duration the laps and even the number of strokes that you have taken
YOU1000000163_S0000062	the e 2 also features a built in gps which not a lot of smartwatches do especially not at this price point
YOU1000000163_S0000063	so if you just want to go out for a run and take d 2 with you this one is perfectly capable of doing that so you will be able to track your path exactly where you run your run time
YOU1000000163_S0000064	and speaking of heart rate tracking the e 2 now comes with mavoy is heart rate monitor 2
YOU1000000163_S0000065	which actually measures your heart rate continuously so 24 7 until obviously the battery dies
YOU1000000163_S0000066	so most smartwatches only measure every hour or every 10 minutes or when you are doing a workout but the e 2 constantly measures your heart rate and then shows you graphs on how your heart rate was at different times
YOU1000000163_S0000067	and speaking of the battery how is it well my voice says that the e 2 would last you for up to 48 hours which is pretty good now personally
YOU1000000163_S0000068	it lasted me for about a day a day and a half but it does depend on how you use it and you know what exactly you do with your smartwatch
YOU1000000163_S0000069	because for example if you go out on a run and have the gps on and you are also tracking your workout then the battery life would only last you for a few hours and this applies to any smartwatch including the apple watch
YOU1000000163_S0000070	okay so so far so good the ticwatch e 2 seems like it cannot exist at its price point
YOU1000000163_S0000071	so what is the catch well it does not have nfc so if you are into google pay then you will not be able to use google pay with the ticwatch e 2
YOU1000000163_S0000072	and then the design is indeed quite chunky so it is quite a thick smartwatch
YOU1000000163_S0000073	but aside from these 2 things you get a large amoled display with no notch or cutouts you get a highest resolution display on any android smartwatch you get a qualcomm snapdragon wear 2100 processor
YOU1000000163_S0000074	512 mb of ram and 4 gb of internal storage so all of these are flagship specs and the fact that it comes with a 24 hour heart rate monitor
YOU1000000163_S0000075	a 50 m water resistance and it only costs $160 at the moment so it might even get cheaper as time goes on
YOU1000000163_S0000076	i honestly think that this is the best bang for the buck in terms of any smartwatch
YOU1000000163_S0000077	if you use the coupon code zonoftech you actually get a 10% discount on both amazon and the mobvoi official website both of them linked in the description below
YOU1000000163_S0000078	and probably the best part about the e 2 is that well it actually works on ios as well so if you have an iphone you can give this a try you can use it because it works
YOU1000000163_S0000079	so if you ever wanted an alternative to the apple watch well the e 2 is half the cost while offering features such as an always on display which the apple watch even lacks
YOU1000000163_S0000080	but no matter if you are team ios or team android if you need an affordable smartwatch that can literally do anything this is honestly the best option at the moment
YOU1000000163_S0000081	so yeah this was a really interesting video to do and it is honestly a really interesting product so yeah thanks to mavoy for sponsoring this video as always all opinions are my own
YOU1000000163_S0000082	as in any of our sponsored videos but yeah feel free to check it out i highly recommend it

YOU1000000164_S0000014	the lego batman movie not long ago the idea of a movie based on legos seemed too silly for words
YOU1000000164_S0000015	but then the lego movie racked up nearly $470 while making us all root for plastic bricks
YOU1000000164_S0000016	and play everything is awesome on endless repeat

YOU1000000164_S0000022	the great wall of china was built to keep out more than just unwanted human neighbors
YOU1000000164_S0000023	from everything we have seen so far the great wall will at least be a spectacular showcase of effects heavy cinematography
YOU1000000164_S0000024	logan
YOU1000000164_S0000025	hugh jackman has played wolverine for so long that it is nearly impossible to imagine anyone else in the role

YOU1000000164_S0000036	what could possibly go wrong
YOU1000000164_S0000038	beauty and the beast
YOU1000000164_S0000039	like disney is earlier beauty this version draws inspiration from the classic fairy tale about a prince played here by dan stevens
YOU1000000164_S0000040	who is cursed with a grotesque appearance yet he finds love with a pure hearted maiden played by emma watson
YOU1000000164_S0000041	who is imprisoned in his castle after her father offers her up in a deal to spare his own life

YOU1000000164_S0000044	plus a cast that includes ewan mcgregor and sir ian mckellen
YOU1000000164_S0000045	power rangers
YOU1000000164_S0000046	the forthcoming power rangers is not the 1st movie to capitalize on the mighty morphin 90s craze of course
YOU1000000164_S0000047	however director dean israelite is take on the story offers a much more serious and emotionally charged counter story
YOU1000000164_S0000048	of how these misfit teens managed to become a band of unlikely world saviors battling back the forces of evil
YOU1000000164_S0000049	if the film does manage to renew even a little bit of the power rangers frenzy that the series enjoyed in the 90s it is going to be massive
YOU1000000164_S0000050	ghost in the shell

YOU1000000164_S0000052	is expected to be a visual spectacular that chronicles an epic chase between a cyborg policewoman and a dangerous hacker
YOU1000000164_S0000053	it promises to offer the same kind of gnarly effects and existential futurism
YOU1000000164_S0000055	that captivated audiences in films like the matrix
YOU1000000164_S0000056	scarlett johansson is own turn in lucy and the 5th element sign us up

YOU1000000164_S0000062	guardians of the galaxy vol 2
YOU1000000164_S0000063	initially it seemed like a hilariously dumb idea for marvel to turn a relatively obscure comic about a ragtag team of intergalactic do gooders
YOU1000000164_S0000064	whose ranks included a raccoon like creature and an alien resembling a sentient tree into a $20 movie
YOU1000000164_S0000065	nearly $7750 in box office for sates later
YOU1000000164_S0000066	the guardians of the galaxy could be the start of an avengers style franchise for the studio
YOU1000000164_S0000067	while we do not have many details regarding what they will be up to this time around it is pretty much a given that it will be tons of fun

YOU1000000164_S0000077	pre production on the 5th installment in the pirates of the caribbean saga

YOU1000000164_S0000079	and its path through development has been strewn with script difficulties and budget induced delays
YOU1000000164_S0000080	still any new chapter in a franchise that is grossed nearly $40 counts as a promising development for the studio
YOU1000000164_S0000081	and disney has stood by while producer jerry bruckheimer steered pirates of the caribbean dead men tell no tales to its destination
YOU1000000164_S0000082	wonder woman

YOU1000000164_S0000085	whatever actually happens in the movie
YOU1000000164_S0000086	it is a long overdue victory for comics fans who have waited years for the amazonian warrior to get a shot at her own big screen franchise
YOU1000000164_S0000087	world war z 2
YOU1000000164_S0000088	the 1st world war z turned out to be surprisingly entertaining as well as extremely commercially successful
YOU1000000164_S0000089	that brings us to the inevitable sequel world war z 2 in which brad pitt returns to battle the zombie plague
YOU1000000164_S0000090	we do not know much about the plot at this point
YOU1000000164_S0000091	but director juan antonio bayona will be working from a screenplay by stephen knight

YOU1000000165_S0000138	my name is charles brunson
YOU1000000165_S0000140	and all my life i have wanted to be famous
YOU1000000165_S0000141	in 2008 this english actor caught the attention of cinephiles and critics with his powerful performance in the indie biopic bronson
YOU1000000165_S0000142	he then proceeded to kick off the new decade with a breakout role in inception
YOU1000000165_S0000143	at which point there was seemingly no stopping him warrior the dark knight rises the revenant mad max fury road and that is not even including his television work
YOU1000000165_S0000144	an incredibly physical actor who is able to convey complex and intense emotion even when saying few words tom hardy shines in blockbusters and smaller films alike
YOU1000000165_S0000145	one need only look at his polar contrasting roles in warrior and locke the latter set entirely in a car to appreciate his versatility if only the academy would pay attention more often
YOU1000000165_S0000146	i just got your message
YOU1000000165_S0000148	it is a joke is it
YOU1000000165_S0000150	look i know it is a shock but it will be okay
YOU1000000165_S0000151	the early 2010s were truly a mcconaissance it was matthew mcconaughey is world everyone else was just living in it
YOU1000000165_S0000152	after too often being dismissed as a rom com hunk for some of the previous 2 decades mcconaughey started demanding respect anew with 2011 is the lincoln lawyer
YOU1000000165_S0000153	you think you are the 1st one to regret me or my family huh
YOU1000000165_S0000154	all i said was she is pretty
YOU1000000165_S0000156	are you scared louis
YOU1000000165_S0000158	is where you are right now
YOU1000000165_S0000160	you are in a very dangerous place
YOU1000000165_S0000161	it was a great performance but few could have predicted just how much stellar acting lay on the horizon killer joe mud and dallas buyers club followed soon after
YOU1000000165_S0000162	with the latter earning him the academy award for best actor add to that his performance in true detective among many others and his immense talent becomes undeniable
YOU1000000165_S0000163	had we been making this list in 2015 he likely would have been in the top 5 but some of his more recent films have admittedly been less well received
YOU1000000165_S0000164	number 7 emma stone
YOU1000000165_S0000165	after her roles in superbad and zombieland emma stone was fairly recognizable though not necessarily destined for the a list just yet
YOU1000000165_S0000166	then in 2010 she starred in a little teen comedy called easy a and everything changed
YOU1000000165_S0000167	let me just begin by saying that there are 2 sides to every story and this is my side the right one
YOU1000000165_S0000168	stone was absolutely magnetic as all of pendergast and like that a star was born one that would rapidly rise over the course of the decade
YOU1000000165_S0000169	the help followed in 2011 for which she earned critical praise before really hitting her stride with birdman la la land and the favorite
YOU1000000165_S0000170	which were all released between 2014 and 2018
YOU1000000165_S0000171	you had a career dad before the 3rd comic book movie before people started to forget who was inside that bird costume
YOU1000000165_S0000172	you are doing a play based on a book that was written 60 years ago for a 1000 rich old white people whose only real concern is going to be where they go to have their cake and coffee when it is over
YOU1000000165_S0000173	the aforementioned films earned stone 3 academy award nominations and 5 golden globe nods
YOU1000000165_S0000174	with a best actress oscar and a golden globe to her name she is a force to be reckoned with
YOU1000000165_S0000175	number 6 ryan gosling speaking of la la land that is just one of the many great performances this talented heartthrob and former child star turned in over the 2010s
YOU1000000165_S0000176	i want you to know you are looking at a new man a man that is happy to be here excellent very easy to work with
YOU1000000165_S0000177	after distinguishing himself with his performance in the 2006 film half nelson gosling really hit his stride in 2010 with blue valentine
YOU1000000165_S0000178	i am being a man now come here hold on this is what magic is like i am tired of talking to you i am fucking tired of talking to you
YOU1000000165_S0000180	from that point on the great roles just kept on coming 2011 saw him starring in drive and the ides of march followed by the place beyond the pines in 2012
YOU1000000165_S0000181	and while there have been some misfires the big short la la land blade runner 2049 and 1st man round out a decade of uncompromising performances from this star
YOU1000000165_S0000182	his 2016 golden globe was well earned but an oscar is overdue
YOU1000000165_S0000183	many an actor has committed life and limb to a role
YOU1000000165_S0000184	but there is arguably no actor who invests more of themselves in a character than christian bale
YOU1000000165_S0000185	and i am a kid brother
YOU1000000165_S0000187	his life is pretty face in the road you can not get used to losing it is a mental thing but we are going to break that with mamby right
YOU1000000165_S0000188	want him to be deathly thin no problem overweight you can do that in peak physical shape with enough notice consider it done while he is famous for radically changing his body to suit a role
YOU1000000165_S0000189	that should not be allowed to overshadow his incredible acting ability
YOU1000000165_S0000191	as it so often does his supporting role in the fighter was absolutely captivating the golden globe and oscar simply could not have gone to anyone else
YOU1000000165_S0000192	and throughout the decade he is continued to deliver in a very consistent manner
YOU1000000165_S0000193	including standout performances in american hustle the big short vice and ford v ferrari
YOU1000000165_S0000194	this american actress often flies under the radar
YOU1000000165_S0000195	even while turning in some of the best performances of the decade because based on her filmography she should be at the center of attention pretty much always
YOU1000000165_S0000196	adams kicked off the decade with a best supporting actress nomination for the fighter and got the same nod in 2013 for her role in the master
YOU1000000165_S0000197	the next year she was nominated best actress for her role in american hustle
YOU1000000165_S0000198	before landing yet another best supporting actress oscar nod for vice
YOU1000000165_S0000199	so can you change
YOU1000000165_S0000201	can you change or am i wasting my goddamn time
YOU1000000165_S0000202	though she is yet to win the academy award she deserves she does have 2 golden globes for best actress and quite frankly the lack of recognition for her role in arrival is criminal
YOU1000000165_S0000203	number 3 jake gyllenhaal
YOU1000000165_S0000204	not unlike amy adams this acclaimed actor tends to keep a relatively lower profile for someone of his status but his filmography reveals just how talented an actor he really is
YOU1000000165_S0000205	especially over the last decade he kicked off the 2010s with the critically lauded but underrated source code
YOU1000000165_S0000206	before blowing critics away in a wide variety of films including end of watch prisoners wildlife and more
YOU1000000165_S0000207	the academy has not shown him much love since brokeback mountain which is quite frankly shocking considering his performance in nightcrawler was among the year is best
YOU1000000165_S0000208	i am looking for a job
YOU1000000165_S0000210	in fact i have made up my mind to find a career that i can learn and grow into who am i i am a hard worker i set high goals and i have been told that i am persistent
YOU1000000165_S0000211	he is just about the last actor we expected to see battling spidey but would not you know it he is just as good in a massive blockbuster as in a gritty drama or a psychological thriller
YOU1000000165_S0000212	to peter parker
YOU1000000165_S0000214	poor kid
YOU1000000165_S0000216	let us get to work
YOU1000000165_S0000217	number 2 leonardo dicaprio many have called him the greatest actor of his generation
YOU1000000165_S0000218	no one needs to be reminded of the many award winning films he starred in over the years but since we are talking about the last decade .
YOU1000000165_S0000219	let us review his astonishing feature filmography
YOU1000000165_S0000220	7 films mostly of the highest quality and even when any of his films falter this master of his craft never fails to turn in a solid performance
YOU1000000165_S0000221	as the revenant and the wolf of wall street remind us he is also very versatile when he steps into a character he truly brings them to life
YOU1000000165_S0000222	the show goes on
YOU1000000165_S0000224	this is my home
YOU1000000165_S0000225	so i guess what we are saying is if some of these people do not already have oscars they will soon has your favorite actor appeared on this list so far if not he or she might soon
YOU1000000165_S0000226	let us look at the honorable mentions and then we will see who clocks in at number one actor of the last decade
YOU1000000165_S0000228	what
YOU1000000165_S0000230	it was perfect
YOU1000000165_S0000231	i have been right here with you troy i got a life too i gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you

YOU1000000165_S0000250	number one joaquin phoenix
YOU1000000165_S0000251	in 2008 phoenix announced he was retiring from acting thankfully it was an elaborate ruse for the 2010 mockumentary i am still here
YOU1000000165_S0000252	though the divisive film was a misstep that could have permanently derailed a career
YOU1000000165_S0000253	phoenix promptly recovered beginning with paul thomas anderson is the master in 2012 which earned him a best actor oscar nomination
YOU1000000165_S0000254	there have been precious few roles since for which he has not been heaped with praise be it in a smaller indie film or a box office smash like joker
YOU1000000165_S0000255	my whole life i did not know if i even really existed
YOU1000000165_S0000257	but i do
YOU1000000165_S0000259	and people are starting to notice
YOU1000000165_S0000260	like leo whatever role phoenix takes on he fully inhabits
YOU1000000165_S0000261	whether a muddled stoner a paralyzed alcoholic cartoonist or a villainous loner he makes them all feel fully realized

YOU1000000166_S0000022	force choking
YOU1000000166_S0000024	are joking i always hated that song
YOU1000000166_S0000026	hello internet welcome to film theory the show that takes the internet is most adorable meme obsession .
YOU1000000166_S0000027	and then turns it into cold hard emotionless learning as much as we all badmouth the empire heading up an intergalactic government
YOU1000000166_S0000028	it has got to be a hard job set the retirement age to 55 and yoda gets to retire before he can barely string a sentence together backwards
YOU1000000166_S0000029	do or do not there is no try
YOU1000000166_S0000030	but if you set the retirement age to like i do not know 550 han solo is never going to see his pension
YOU1000000166_S0000032	i wonder there was a rebellion against these guys now in case you are not hip with the kids lately or did not trample your loved ones in your rush to sign up for disney
YOU1000000166_S0000033	i am talking about baby yoda the tiny cuddly wobbly bubbakins of the new disney plus show the mandalorian
YOU1000000166_S0000034	the baby version of a member of yoda is species who is in one episode already the most endearing character in this franchise
YOU1000000166_S0000035	move aside porgs get the boot ewoks baby yoda filled the void that you never could
YOU1000000166_S0000036	baby yoda is like cute ception but the kicker is that by our standards he is not even a baby the mandalorian depicts him as a 50 year old toddler
YOU1000000166_S0000037	their age that is all you can give me
YOU1000000166_S0000038	yes they are 50 years old
YOU1000000166_S0000039	by star wars standards that would make baby yoda part of the silent generation and by that i mean the one that came before the baby boomers which of course in star wars were all the babies that were born right after alderaan went .
YOU1000000166_S0000040	boom okay boomers there is one less planet in the galaxy
YOU1000000166_S0000041	and listen this topic hits really close to home for me because i currently own a toddler
YOU1000000166_S0000042	you will hear parents saying stuff like i wish they could stay little forever but half a century of diaper changes is something no one is signing up for
YOU1000000166_S0000043	but all those diapers and memes got me thinking 50 years is a really long time to be a baby a relatively helpless baby
YOU1000000166_S0000044	and i am saying that as a human the species with the longest adolescence on the planet so how does this insanely long childhood happen
YOU1000000166_S0000045	and is there any way that 50 years of tummy time could be remotely plausible scientifically well i started researching as i do it
YOU1000000166_S0000046	and it turns out that it is not just scientific precedent but an explanation here for almost everything that we know about the entire yoda species
YOU1000000166_S0000047	that is right understanding the biology of baby yoda is not just a fun fact from the mandalorian or me overthinking a sci fi franchise
YOU1000000166_S0000048	but it is the single key to understanding the most beloved character in star wars history
YOU1000000166_S0000049	and why he yoda by the time we get to the main series of movies is pretty much the only one of his species left
YOU1000000166_S0000050	i got to say between this theory and the last one i did over on game theory about star wars force being pretty much scientifically accurate which if you have not watched it
YOU1000000166_S0000051	you absolutely should after this episode i am starting to think that george lucas might secretly be a scientific genius almost let us not give him too much credit
YOU1000000166_S0000052	so join me as i take a look into the evolutionary biology of baby yoda and finally figure out why they are so cool and also why they are practically extinct
YOU1000000166_S0000053	before we open your biology textbooks to chapter 5 we need to clear the air on one thing no i do not know the actual name of the species yoda comes from
YOU1000000166_S0000054	but you know what i am in good company because george lucas did not either george lucas specifically did not want yoda is species to have a name
YOU1000000166_S0000055	and rarely sanctioned work that revealed information about their lore so even though the yoda species existed in places like knights of the old republic the video game information about them does not appear in anything
YOU1000000166_S0000056	that is officially canon anymore so instead of spending this entire episode saying the word yoda and having to clarify between whether i am talking about yoda the species or yoda the individual member of that species
YOU1000000166_S0000057	i will instead be referring to the yoda species as the tridactyls
YOU1000000166_S0000058	because their extremities have 3 digits right but bear in mind that is really just a fan made designation for all the members of the yoda species that we are currently aware of which are just 3
YOU1000000166_S0000059	honestly you got original yoda you got yaddle from the phantom menace who just appears for a couple seconds and baby yoda whatever his name ends up being from the mandalorian
YOU1000000166_S0000060	so with that bit of housekeeping out of the way and with the very short list of actual known members of the yoda species what do we know about tridactyls
YOU1000000166_S0000061	we know that yoda lived to the ripe old age of 900 in return of the jedi which everyone else is surprised about but he is not seeming to indicate that it is not really that big of a deal for him
YOU1000000166_S0000062	baby yoda who is just stuck with that name for this episode i guess is 50 but functionally he is about a 10 month old
YOU1000000166_S0000063	if my kid is any indication he is nonverbal but he is capable of walking and getting into trouble so we know
YOU1000000166_S0000064	as a tridactyl you get 900 years in the galaxy on the high end but at least the
YOU1000000166_S0000066	the 1st 50 of them are spent as a baby which i guess leaves like a 100 to make it through high school
YOU1000000166_S0000067	another 200 years of living in your parents basement before finally getting your own apartment at the tender age of 300
YOU1000000166_S0000068	now because we are working in outer space and in a fictional franchise it is worth double checking when they say that baby yoda is 50 years old in the mandalorian
YOU1000000166_S0000069	does that translate to years as we understand them here on earth and it appears like it does according to wikipedia the republic standardized its time based on coruscant
YOU1000000166_S0000070	which conveniently rotates its sun exactly once every 365 coruscantian days which are broken down themselves into 24 hour increments
YOU1000000166_S0000071	and then minutes that are incredibly close to our own minutes so when yoda says that he is 900 years old it is pretty close to what we think 900 years is
YOU1000000166_S0000072	and the mandalorian has every reason to be surprised that his 50 year old mark was still a baby
YOU1000000166_S0000073	so knowing that it is time to talk about the biology having such a long development period is more than just an interesting evolutionary quirk
YOU1000000166_S0000074	it actually tells us a lot about how tridactyls may have evolved over time mostly because it parallels a lot of our own human evolution
YOU1000000166_S0000075	you see most animals evolved to shorten the amount of time between birth and reproductive maturity so that they can go on and grow their population as fast as possible
YOU1000000166_S0000076	but that is not the only successful evolutionary strategy you may have noticed that us humans have incredibly long and particularly vulnerable childhoods
YOU1000000166_S0000077	when a baby giraffe is born it can stand almost almost almost right away 0 they are so cute humans on the other hand not so much
YOU1000000166_S0000078	it is taking months if not a year for a baby human to actually get up on its feet so why do humans the smartest animals on the planet
YOU1000000166_S0000079	come out so useless
YOU1000000166_S0000080	well turns out that the whole issue comes down to our brains you see our brainy heads and the fact that they are so fat have changed our entire course of human evolution
YOU1000000166_S0000081	our ancestors who many believe emerged from sub saharan africa were among the 1st species of animals to stop walking around on 4 legs
YOU1000000166_S0000082	and start walking up on 2 our brains were big enough that we were able to logic out the idea that it took less energy to walk on 2 legs
YOU1000000166_S0000083	and it minimized our bald skin is exposure to the extremely hot ground temperatures in those african deserts
YOU1000000166_S0000084	as newly bipedal people our evolution started favoring other members of our species who could also walk upright good for us natural selection at its finest
YOU1000000166_S0000085	but there is always a price to pay for innovation you see as we evolve to be more and more capable of walking
YOU1000000166_S0000086	and running around on 2 legs our bodies evolve to facilitate that and compensate for our changed center of gravity primarily doing this by narrowing our hips
YOU1000000166_S0000087	this in turn helped us to walk upright like champs but now all of a sudden we had a problem that big fat head of ours was literally too big to be born
YOU1000000166_S0000088	sure we had ourselves a big brain but now there was nowhere for it to go because our hips were too narrow to accommodate birthing ahead that huge
YOU1000000166_S0000089	so human evolution had to change again as the theory goes we started having babies earlier in their gestational period
YOU1000000166_S0000090	earlier at a time when the baby was still tiny and smushy and helpless which would be pretty darn bad for our survival except for one thing
YOU1000000166_S0000091	the heads were still small enough to squeeze up on out of there still a very painful process but now at least it was doable
YOU1000000166_S0000092	and then once the baby was on the other end there would be what is known as the 4th trimester
YOU1000000166_S0000093	an extra trimester of development that happens outside in the real world where we as parents would have to take care of that helpless newborn
YOU1000000166_S0000094	because technically it still should have been developing in the womb it just needed to be you know evicted from its home before it was too big to leave its door
YOU1000000166_S0000095	now let us take a look at our friendly yoda what features do we see well he is bipedal he is small with a disproportionately huge head for his highly evolved brain
YOU1000000166_S0000096	he has got a short highly efficient body with diminutive narrow features including his hips even looking at the basic character model
YOU1000000166_S0000097	you can see how in order to procreate the tridactyls would have to have themselves radically different proportions
YOU1000000166_S0000098	you can also see how having a big brain is a huge evolutionary advantage humans are so far at the top of the food chain that we protect other members of the food chain
YOU1000000166_S0000099	tridactyls in the star wars universe are the wisest and most powerful force users in the galaxy
YOU1000000166_S0000100	but the downside is that they like us are essentially born too early helpless for months if not years or until at least their dad makes them pay rent
YOU1000000166_S0000101	and their mom stops doing their laundry this theory continues to hold water if we look at infancy for humans versus infancy for tridactyls in their 1st 2 years
YOU1000000166_S0000102	human baby brains grow to 75% of their full adult size we do not know if this is the same for tridactyls
YOU1000000166_S0000103	but we do know that the proportions of human babies parallel the proportions of baby yoda enormous head adorably tiny body
YOU1000000166_S0000104	besides making babies hilariously top heavy these proportions also serve a function in infancy
YOU1000000166_S0000105	human brains command up to 87% of the total energy that the body uses at rest
YOU1000000166_S0000106	meaning that even while sleeping the body is diverting a massive amount of energy to growing the brain
YOU1000000166_S0000107	because of this the rest of the baby is growth lags behind the head where the brain is this according to the expensive tissue hypothesis
YOU1000000166_S0000108	we can see that baby yoda is an extreme version of this principle with a wildly huge and merchandisable head
YOU1000000166_S0000109	and a teeny tiny body making me think that baby yoda is an extremely evolved version of what the human race could look like someday
YOU1000000166_S0000111	the process of evolutionarily elongating the development period is called niat d
YOU1000000166_S0000112	and after humans benefited from it surviving when our relatives did not well evolution did not stop its roll
YOU1000000166_S0000113	humans are actually still experiencing longer development periods now than we even did 10000 years ago
YOU1000000166_S0000114	the shape of our faces and heads are continually becoming less like our neanderthal cousins by becoming flatter less hairy less oblong
YOU1000000166_S0000115	again we share a lot of these same features with yoda who is small flat faced with an enormous head but if human evolution continues to make our childhoods longer and longer
YOU1000000166_S0000116	the question of course becomes where does it stop well it stops at yoda
YOU1000000166_S0000117	the problem with a long childhood is that a lot can happen when you are tiny and helpless
YOU1000000166_S0000118	eventually there is an evolutionary tipping point where childhood becomes so long that it actually leaves the species too vulnerable to survive into adulthood
YOU1000000166_S0000119	tridactyls could very well be the extreme end point of a species like ours
YOU1000000166_S0000120	as the mandalorian clearly shows baby tridactyls even 50 year old baby tridactyls are not capable of taking care of themselves
YOU1000000166_S0000121	sure they have impressive force powers but very little control over them
YOU1000000166_S0000123	human children similarly are pretty darn helpless and it means that we have to do things like baby proof the house and make up all kinds of safety rules for kids
YOU1000000166_S0000124	imagine having to worry about that sort of stuff for 50 or even 100 years it becomes extremely hard for the species to get their offspring to a place of self sufficiency
YOU1000000166_S0000125	and that is just the tip of the iceberg natural disasters plagues drone attacks from the empire
YOU1000000166_S0000126	all of those things are going to be pretty darn hard to avoid but they become a lot easier to bounce back from if suddenly your species can repopulate quickly
YOU1000000166_S0000127	but if all of a sudden you are spending a 100 years or more to reproduce a single generation
YOU1000000166_S0000128	i mean you are just begging for the next death star to give you a little zap which brings us to yoda
YOU1000000166_S0000129	we know so little about his history but what we are able to theorize is pretty darn incredible he is practically the last of his species
YOU1000000166_S0000130	because of the evolutionary double edged sword that he is dealing with on one hand he is one of the most highly evolved beings in the galaxy
YOU1000000166_S0000131	but he is so evolved that his species can no longer survive they are completely obscure
YOU1000000166_S0000132	it is incredibly tragic and no we do not have any of the details about how the tridactyls were wiped out but that elongated childhood
YOU1000000166_S0000133	that extended neoteny to the extremes of 50 plus years of childhood that is certainly a massive contributor
YOU1000000166_S0000134	as to why so incredibly star wars the series often derided as being space fantasy
YOU1000000166_S0000135	and not science fiction turns out to be scientifically plausible yet again so got to hand it to you lucas i am pretty stunned
YOU1000000166_S0000136	no i have tried to help you out with this and the whole midichlorians powering the force thing but i got to admit still have some quibbles to level at you about the jedi is recruitment practices
YOU1000000166_S0000137	that one will be coming up pretty soon we have some bones to pick on that front okay friend in the meantime if you did not see the real life equivalent of midichlorians
YOU1000000166_S0000138	and how they are actually powering the real life force in your day to day life click the video that you see on screen right now
YOU1000000166_S0000139	that will take you to my other science of star wars episode over on game theory looking at midichlorian is mitochondria
YOU1000000166_S0000140	and how we are all just a little bit jedi in the meantime remember that is just a theory a film theory and cut
YOU1000000167_S0000000	winnie the pooh and the royal birthday inspired by a a milne and e h shepard with decorations by mark burgess
YOU1000000167_S0000002	read by jim broadbent
YOU1000000167_S0000004	you could tell christopher robin had something important to say from the way he clasped his knees tightly and wriggled his toes
YOU1000000167_S0000006	everybody gathered round and looked at him expectantly
YOU1000000167_S0000008	i have heard that her majesty christopher robin began squeaked piglet in a state of great excitement
YOU1000000167_S0000009	a royal highness he went on quite so quite so agreed rabbit the queen of england he said quickly before anyone else could interrupt him
YOU1000000167_S0000010	0 the queen said pooh bear much relieved the other people you mentioned sounded much too tall and fearsome but the queen is quite different
YOU1000000167_S0000011	pooh had once sent a letter and was told to stick on a small picture of the queen it stuck more to his nose than to the letter
YOU1000000167_S0000012	but it told the postman that it was most urgent and that the queen says it must be sent and so he was sure it had been
YOU1000000167_S0000014	as i was saying said christopher robin passing pooh a honey sandwich so that he might continue speaking
YOU1000000167_S0000015	her majesty the queen is celebrating an important birthday her 90th birthday and we should too celebrate it
YOU1000000167_S0000016	that is by giving her a present
YOU1000000167_S0000018	i had a present once sighed eor wistfully
YOU1000000167_S0000020	2 in fact if i may boast a little
YOU1000000167_S0000022	one was rather small and damp and the other somewhat larger and sticky
YOU1000000167_S0000024	but i do not like to complain
YOU1000000167_S0000026	the present is something and to have 2 is something else
YOU1000000167_S0000028	both pooh and piglet blushed slightly they had a memory of a wonderful balloon and a large jar of the best honey
YOU1000000167_S0000029	that had begun as exceedingly good presents and then
YOU1000000167_S0000030	due to various mishaps had become rather disappointing presents
YOU1000000167_S0000031	but which were presents nevertheless and as eor had said that was something
YOU1000000167_S0000033	the question is said rabbit importantly what do queens like best
YOU1000000167_S0000035	the honey i should think sighed pooh looking at the small sticky crumb where the honey sandwiches had once been
YOU1000000167_S0000037	i have heard said christopher robin who knew a great deal about faraway places like the other side of the forest and london
YOU1000000167_S0000038	that the queen has a grand tea every day in her palace with buttered toast and crumpets
YOU1000000167_S0000039	so i should not think we would need to give her anything to eat a present should be something to treasure
YOU1000000167_S0000041	i have never had much luck finding treasure sighed pooh
YOU1000000167_S0000043	but i did once find the north pole do you suppose the queen might like that
YOU1000000167_S0000045	the friends thought this an excellent idea but it was not long before they realized that finding the north pole once was a very fine thing
YOU1000000167_S0000046	but that finding it again was an altogether different thing
YOU1000000167_S0000048	suddenly the forest seemed to be full of sticks that could or could not be the north pole
YOU1000000167_S0000050	this will never do announced rabbit
YOU1000000167_S0000052	do mumbled pooh that brings to mind a little hum which i would like to hum
YOU1000000167_S0000053	if it was felt that a hum was called for at such a time of thoughtfulness and without waiting for a reply he began
YOU1000000167_S0000055	the queen lived in her palace as queens often do
YOU1000000167_S0000057	doing all those busy things busy queens do
YOU1000000167_S0000059	but the queen could never know as you and i do
YOU1000000167_S0000061	that doing nothing much can be the best thing to do
YOU1000000167_S0000063	to from a forest far away for your special day
YOU1000000167_S0000065	we are sending you some quiet and a little time to play
YOU1000000167_S0000067	and quiet there was
YOU1000000167_S0000069	the sort of quiet that makes the tip of your nose turn a sunset shade of pink
YOU1000000167_S0000071	baa
YOU1000000167_S0000073	announced christopher robin solemnly
YOU1000000167_S0000075	that hum is fit for a queen that hum shall be the queen is present al shall write it out and you and i
YOU1000000167_S0000076	and eeyore will deliver it to buckingham palace and piglet must come too because london is a very big place indeed
YOU1000000167_S0000077	and even small animals if they are very good friends can make everything all right
YOU1000000167_S0000079	and so it was decided and owl was called for owl fussed here and fussed there
YOU1000000167_S0000081	and used up a good deal of time paper and ink but at last it was done and everyone admired it
YOU1000000167_S0000082	kanga who knew how important presentation was especially for queens took the hum rolled it
YOU1000000167_S0000083	and tied a thick vine round it into the vine she twisted wild heather columbine buttercups meadow sweet thyme
YOU1000000167_S0000084	and lastly a thistle kindly donated by eeyore
YOU1000000167_S0000086	christopher robin also found a beautiful bright red balloon which he thought the queen might enjoy on gray days
YOU1000000167_S0000087	piglet you should hold it he said that way we will not lose you in the crowd
YOU1000000167_S0000089	piglet held on very tightly to the balloon he was not quite sure what a crowd was something like a dark cloud perhaps
YOU1000000167_S0000090	but in any case he did not want to get lost in it and was pleased the balloon would help
YOU1000000167_S0000092	so the presents were ready and side by side winnie the pooh edward bear bear of very little brain brave adventurer
YOU1000000167_S0000093	and loyal friend his small companion piglet eeyore and christopher robin set off for london
YOU1000000167_S0000095	of course london is on quite the other side remarked christopher robin as they were walking
YOU1000000167_S0000097	of the sea asked pooh somewhat alarmed
YOU1000000167_S0000099	not the sea i should not think replied christopher robin whose geography lessons so far had been mostly spent coloring in edgy bits
YOU1000000167_S0000100	but certainly the country or county i am not quite sure which in any case it is very far off when we shall have to catch a train
YOU1000000167_S0000102	i do hope it wants to be caught said poo who was already a little out of puff from the walk but the train was good enough to stop for them in the station
YOU1000000167_S0000103	so there was no catching to be done at all and there was plenty of time to climb aboard and find 4 comfy seats
YOU1000000167_S0000104	and then they were off
YOU1000000167_S0000106	would you be so kind as to stay very close by asked an anxious piglet as they got off the train at victoria station
YOU1000000167_S0000107	he had not expected london to have quite so many legs
YOU1000000167_S0000109	there were pin striped legs big booted legs and some legs balanced on pointy shoes which seemed to have a little stick stuck to the bottom of each sole
YOU1000000167_S0000111	and they were all in a terrible rush and seemed to know exactly where they were going
YOU1000000167_S0000113	christopher robin pooh piglet and eeyore launched themselves into this vast forest of legs and hoped they would come out all right
YOU1000000167_S0000115	they emerged into a busy street
YOU1000000167_S0000117	christopher robin told them that the large black vehicles rushing past were called traffic
YOU1000000167_S0000119	who thought that traffic looked like giant shiny beetles and thinking of them as beetles made it less worrying
YOU1000000167_S0000121	the friends walked and they walked
YOU1000000167_S0000122	but eeyore is size that had started out as small puffs were now growing so large and loud
YOU1000000167_S0000123	that they were worried he would run out of puff altogether and winnie the pooh is legs were known for their stoutness not their brisk walking
YOU1000000167_S0000124	and piglets legs were so short that they were hardly worth speaking of at all
YOU1000000167_S0000126	so christopher robin suggested they ride on a bus the rest of the way to buckingham palace
YOU1000000167_S0000128	most considerate i am sure sighed eor
YOU1000000167_S0000130	although slightly less puffily this time
YOU1000000167_S0000132	the friends had never been on a bus before and this was a most unusual one it had winding stairs
YOU1000000167_S0000133	and up at the top there was no roof at all
YOU1000000167_S0000135	as the bus began to move the wind did its best to blow piglet is ears right off and he nearly lost hold of the balloon
YOU1000000167_S0000136	we will call this the blustery bus laughed christopher robin
YOU1000000167_S0000138	the bus took the friends past a great many important buildings
YOU1000000167_S0000140	and christopher robin did not know all the names
YOU1000000167_S0000142	there was one very grand old shop which pooh found strangely familiar but he told himself he was being silly
YOU1000000167_S0000143	as this was surely his 1st visit to london
YOU1000000167_S0000145	at the next stop they were able to get out and stretch their legs a little
YOU1000000167_S0000147	this is trafalgar square said the driver look out for the lions
YOU1000000167_S0000149	lions gasped piglet in some alarm and there were indeed lions
YOU1000000167_S0000150	but thankfully not the furry ones with hot breath and hungry eyes that they were imagining
YOU1000000167_S0000152	these lions were cold and majestic and their backs were shiny from where many people had sat upon them
YOU1000000167_S0000156	0 how i would love to have a lion christopher robin sighed
YOU1000000167_S0000158	but pooh thought that bears were best and pulled christopher robin back to the bus
YOU1000000167_S0000160	the tour then took them past an enormous clock in a high up tower christopher robin told them that this clock is largest bell was called big ben
YOU1000000167_S0000162	i feel sure said pooh that with this clock i could really learn to tell the time with smaller clocks i do try to tell it but it just does not listen
YOU1000000167_S0000163	the numbers jump about so and the little hand chases the big hand just to tease it and 0 clock is not an 0 at all
YOU1000000167_S0000164	and seconds are not a little something more to eat and everything gets so terribly muddled
YOU1000000167_S0000166	a clock like this though is sure to behave itself
YOU1000000167_S0000168	but the friends could not stay to learn to tell the time because the next stop for the bus was buckingham palace
YOU1000000167_S0000170	0 pooh whispered piglet as they climbed off the bus is not it grand
YOU1000000167_S0000172	and it certainly was behind golden gates windows rose up in every direction rows and rows of windows
YOU1000000167_S0000173	and above it all the royal standard flag waved proudly in the sky
YOU1000000167_S0000175	the flag means that the queen is at home announced christopher robin who knew a great deal about queens and suchlike because he had come to buckingham palace once before many years ago
YOU1000000167_S0000177	well it is all very well for some complained eor i have never had a flag myself
YOU1000000167_S0000179	but then i am always at home one boggy place is much like another and i do not hold with all this packing up
YOU1000000167_S0000180	and farewell and see you soon pallava
YOU1000000167_S0000182	at that moment a bugle sounded piglet gave a startled jump and then continued jumping in time with the marching band
YOU1000000167_S0000183	to show that it had not been a startled jump at all
YOU1000000167_S0000185	the queen is guard marched past they were splendid in their bright red uniforms shiny buttons and tall furry hats
YOU1000000167_S0000187	what do you think they keep under their hats pooh asked biglet a little out of breath after all his jumping
YOU1000000167_S0000189	perhaps a little something to nibble on just a smackerel of something sticky perhaps
YOU1000000167_S0000191	sweet certainly
YOU1000000167_S0000193	whose voice faded off into a happy dream
YOU1000000167_S0000195	but all at once there was a stirring in the crowd and the murmur rose up it is the queen the queen is coming
YOU1000000167_S0000197	pooh and piglet squeeze their way to the front of the crowd
YOU1000000167_S0000199	and then they saw a sight that they had always secretly hoped for but had never dared imagine might really happen
YOU1000000167_S0000201	the queen herself was out for a stroll and she was greeting the crowd as she went
YOU1000000167_S0000203	she was just as queenly and smiley and wonderful as they had expected her to be
YOU1000000167_S0000205	the queen was so close that they could have reached out and touched her fine coat
YOU1000000167_S0000207	winnie the pooh knew that it was now or never
YOU1000000167_S0000209	boldly he stepped forward
YOU1000000167_S0000211	and recited his hum in the loudest bravest voice he could manage in the circumstances
YOU1000000167_S0000213	the queen smiled warmly at them all
YOU1000000167_S0000215	behind the queen ran a little boy he was much younger than christopher robin and almost as bouncy as tigger he caught sight of piglet and the balloon
YOU1000000167_S0000216	and he jumped up and down in delight
YOU1000000167_S0000218	the little boy patted piglet fondly and tickled winnie the pooh is ears
YOU1000000167_S0000220	piglet handed him the beautiful balloon and he giggled and skipped away with it
YOU1000000167_S0000222	where is eeyore asked christopher robin anxiously as the queen walked on to greet other people in the crowd
YOU1000000167_S0000224	with all the excitement they had quite forgotten about him
YOU1000000167_S0000226	and then they saw him with his back to them staring up at the palace
YOU1000000167_S0000228	i believe i saw the queen at one of the windows he announced proudly
YOU1000000167_S0000229	we must be heading home now interrupted christopher robin who could not bear to disappoint dear old eeyore who had missed the whole thing
YOU1000000167_S0000231	later when the story had been retold over and over again winnie the pooh was sure that the queen had said 0 charmy
YOU1000000167_S0000232	but what was certain was that the hum had been shared and the queen had gone
YOU1000000167_S0000234	she was back behind the tall golden gates of buckingham palace where no bear could go
YOU1000000167_S0000237	do you think the queen liked my hum christopher robin asked pooh as they walked down the mall
YOU1000000167_S0000239	silly old bear i am sure of it he replied squeezing his paw a little tighter
YOU1000000167_S0000241	it must be a very great thing to be 90 years old mused pooh
YOU1000000167_S0000243	pleased to be on his way back home where a little smackerel of something was sure to be awaiting them
YOU1000000167_S0000245	what the friends did not realize
YOU1000000167_S0000247	that pooh bear had arrived in the forest in the very same year that princess elizabeth was born
YOU1000000167_S0000249	but time is a tricky thing years begin by lazing along slowly and then suddenly up they jump and off they trot as quickly as ever they can
YOU1000000167_S0000251	to winnie the pooh it felt like just yesterday that he had come bumping down those stairs bump bump bump

YOU1000000168_S0000009	10 the capybara on 1st sight you may confuse this large cuteness for one big guinea pig and you would actually be right
YOU1000000168_S0000010	the south american capybara is one of the largest rodents in the world it can weigh up to £140 not to worry
YOU1000000168_S0000011	you will not be needing a huge cage because capybaras are semi aquatic rodents so scratch the dog sized hamster wheel off your list
YOU1000000168_S0000012	because this animal definitely needs access to a body of water in order to swim around like your pool
YOU1000000168_S0000014	although mostly adorable and sweet capybaras can be a challenging pet especially because they are extremely social animals
YOU1000000168_S0000015	so if you are planning on owning one it is best to make room for a couple more this rodent is legal to own in most parts of the world
YOU1000000168_S0000016	although some countries and states may require a separate license but those cute and furry snouts are well worth the extra paperwork
YOU1000000168_S0000017	9 the serval now we can not all adopt a royal bengal tiger as mike tyson once did
YOU1000000168_S0000018	but most cat lovers would surely love to settle for this wild beauty servals can even be litter trained if you start early enough
YOU1000000168_S0000020	these medium sized african cats are accustomed to warm climates and wide open spaces
YOU1000000168_S0000021	for you pet owners it means you will need a moderate amount of space for your exotic cat to feel at home
YOU1000000168_S0000023	servals require lots of daily exercise and love to play so a spacious garden is probably your best bet
YOU1000000168_S0000025	8 the fennec fox as if foxes were not cute enough we give you the fennec fox
YOU1000000168_S0000026	have a look at those ears they are phenomenal
YOU1000000168_S0000027	these foxes come from the african continent and are the smallest breed of fox in the world
YOU1000000168_S0000029	only reaching about £4 when fully grown but the same cannot be said about the size of those adorable ears
YOU1000000168_S0000030	if you never quite figured out whether you are a cat or a dog person the fennec fox may become your favorite 4 legged companion
YOU1000000168_S0000031	tim what are you doing
YOU1000000168_S0000033	boop
YOU1000000168_S0000035	this fox is behavior can best be described as a crossway between that of a dog and a cat
YOU1000000168_S0000037	they are usually playful and energetic like a dog but just as equally independent like a cat so you will be fine leaving them home alone for a few hours
YOU1000000168_S0000039	what sets them apart though is that they do not really favor dog nor cat toys this exotic animal can live up to 15 years
YOU1000000168_S0000040	and is legal to own in most of america with the exception of a few states but hey if you are dying to own one you can always just move to another state
YOU1000000168_S0000042	0 my god
YOU1000000168_S0000044	7 box turtles
YOU1000000168_S0000046	although they can be tricky to care for box turtles make some cute and seriously long term reptilian companions like most turtles
YOU1000000168_S0000048	they carry their homes on their backs and this species can live for up to 50 years
YOU1000000168_S0000050	which may seem like a lot for a household pet but is laughable when compared to jonathan the world is oldest turtle at 189 years old
YOU1000000168_S0000052	box turtles like to soak in water from time to time to rehydrate and cool down
YOU1000000168_S0000054	but that does not necessarily make them pro swimmers in fact they are actually land turtles
YOU1000000168_S0000056	and look pretty clumsy while doing it so despite their sharp beaks rough scaly skin and tiny pointed claws
YOU1000000168_S0000057	a box turtle can make a pretty darn cute addition to your terrarium
YOU1000000168_S0000059	6 the chinchilla from hamsters to gerbils rodents have a reputation as one of the cutest household pets
YOU1000000168_S0000060	but on the more exotic end of the spectrum and perhaps 10 times more adorable is the chinchilla
YOU1000000168_S0000062	the south american chinchilla can bond very closely with its caretaker
YOU1000000168_S0000064	but unfortunately is one of the more destructive rodents
YOU1000000168_S0000066	that is not to say they are dangerous or anything they just do not like to be cuddled
YOU1000000168_S0000067	ow ow ow you bit me hard
YOU1000000168_S0000068	at least not nearly as much as they love to run around and play they are quite active and get bored pretty easily
YOU1000000168_S0000070	so you will need more than a plain old hamster wheel to keep these little guys busy
YOU1000000168_S0000072	but we are sure you will agree those gigantic ears and that fluffy tail are well worth the extra effort
YOU1000000168_S0000074	5 the sugar glider
YOU1000000168_S0000076	if you have ever wondered what it is like to own a flying squirrel
YOU1000000168_S0000078	then you should purchase a sugar glider while squirrels can not be domesticated sugar gliders are the next best thing and many would agree a lot cuter
YOU1000000168_S0000080	just look at those eyes
YOU1000000168_S0000082	although the 2 look similar sugar gliders are actually part of the marsupial family just like kangaroos
YOU1000000168_S0000084	the female is glider doubles as a pouch where they raise their young until they are old enough to fly off
YOU1000000168_S0000086	i mean glidoff on their own
YOU1000000168_S0000088	if you are wondering where they got the name it is because they love to eat almost anything that is sweet especially fresh fruit and vegetables
YOU1000000168_S0000090	the best part about these australian natives is that they love playdates with their caregivers and get along great with other animals
YOU1000000168_S0000092	4 the kinkajou
YOU1000000168_S0000094	kinkajous are small golden brown honey bears that are native to rainforests and have become increasingly popular as pets
YOU1000000168_S0000095	celebrities such as paris hilton is known to own a kinkajou and a sugar glider but the rich and famous are not the only ones who find these animals adorable
YOU1000000168_S0000096	no no do not eat that no
YOU1000000168_S0000098	take it just grab it
YOU1000000168_S0000099	making the decision to care for a kinkajou is not to be taken lightly though as these nocturnal animals like to get into things and can be pretty messy
YOU1000000168_S0000101	3 the crested gecko
YOU1000000168_S0000103	creepy crawly but still kind of cute despite their preferred diet of crickets and mealworms
YOU1000000168_S0000105	the crested gecko has a pretty goofy smile and tiny hands
YOU1000000168_S0000107	just look at them they are so tiny and the eyes well we will leave it up to you to decide
YOU1000000168_S0000109	but one thing is for sure the crested gecko is one of the cutest reptiles you can own
YOU1000000168_S0000111	their low maintenance care and funny personalities have made them extremely popular pets
YOU1000000168_S0000113	because they are so simple to care for crested geckos make excellent pets for kids and beginner reptile parents
YOU1000000168_S0000115	it is now time for today is subscriber pick we asked our subscribers to send in their pictures for their cutest exotic animals and today is thumbnail pick was sent to us by a subscriber wondering about
YOU1000000168_S0000116	this incredible picture of a small monkey hanging with a human finger so we looked into it and it turns out that it is a finger monkey
YOU1000000168_S0000117	pygmy marmoset that is the smallest primate in the world very close to our number 2 pick for the list their babies are 5 to 6 inches tall in length
YOU1000000168_S0000118	and weighs around 100 grams these smallest monkeys are indeed the cutest animals in today is video but we cannot include them in our list
YOU1000000168_S0000119	because they are illegal to own in most parts of the world
YOU1000000168_S0000121	2 the capuchin monkey
YOU1000000168_S0000123	the cute capuchin monkey is a primate that is often seen in movies and television it is famous for its small size and known for its playful mischievous attitude
YOU1000000168_S0000124	remember jack sparrow is monkey and pirates of the caribbean
YOU1000000168_S0000126	they are highly intelligent territorial and will live up to 40 years that is 40 years of diapers unless you can teach your monkey to use the toilet
YOU1000000168_S0000128	before we reveal number one be sure to check out other amazing videos on our channel and give us a like if you enjoyed this video so far
YOU1000000168_S0000129	tell us in comments which one of these you like the most and why
YOU1000000168_S0000131	one the hermit crab
YOU1000000168_S0000133	if your definition of a pet is sweet and fluffy then underwater crawlers probably are not the 1st thing that come to mind
YOU1000000168_S0000135	but here is one little critter that can make your aquarium just a little bit cuter not just for its bulging eyes but because of its distinct personality
YOU1000000168_S0000137	unlike most crabs hermits have a smaller soft abdomen
YOU1000000168_S0000139	which they adorably protect by living in an empty snail shell
YOU1000000168_S0000141	they must continue to find larger shells as they grow in size so the owners of these pets must provide progressively larger shells over their lifetime
YOU1000000168_S0000143	creating a very special bond between caregiver and animal
YOU1000000169_S0000001	her eyes and ears that were closed for the 1st 2 weeks of her life are now opening
YOU1000000169_S0000003	and with this comes a whole new world of sensory stimulation
YOU1000000169_S0000005	she uses her vision to move around
YOU1000000169_S0000007	but does she see the world the same way we do
YOU1000000169_S0000009	well dogs are colorblind
YOU1000000169_S0000011	but that does not mean that everything is black and white
YOU1000000169_S0000013	she does see color but mostly just blues and yellows
YOU1000000169_S0000015	it is because she only has 2 types of color receptors compared to humans who have 3
YOU1000000169_S0000017	and it is also why your dog will often ignore an orange toy in the green grass
YOU1000000169_S0000019	as those colors look the same to them
YOU1000000169_S0000021	better to give them something blue
YOU1000000169_S0000023	but it is when things are moving that her vision comes into its own
YOU1000000169_S0000025	dogs eyes process what they see more quickly than we do
YOU1000000169_S0000027	it is almost like they see in slow motion
YOU1000000169_S0000029	that is why they are always in the right place to catch the frisbee
YOU1000000169_S0000031	psychology professor john pilley was interested in finding out how many words a dog could learn
YOU1000000169_S0000033	and 7 years ago he found the perfect student jason
YOU1000000169_S0000035	using crate loads of toys john and his colleagues devised a groundbreaking study of canine intelligence
YOU1000000169_S0000037	the toys all have names that chaser has learned throughout her life and john picks 8 at random
YOU1000000169_S0000039	chase let us play some chase find punt go get punt brain pop pop punt do it go do it
YOU1000000169_S0000040	yeah good girl chase find roach
YOU1000000169_S0000042	i am roach i want roach good girl
YOU1000000169_S0000043	john never looks at the toys on the mat so to pick the right object chaser has to actually understand what he is saying
YOU1000000169_S0000045	yeah there is wow hint up hint up
YOU1000000169_S0000047	in 3 years of intensive training chaser has learned an astounding 1022 words
YOU1000000169_S0000048	that is 116 balls 26 frisbees and over 800 cloth animals but how does she do it
YOU1000000169_S0000050	on the mat are 5 items chase her nose and one new one she is never seen a cat that john calls meow
YOU1000000169_S0000051	chase find meow find meow find meow do it girl do it do it do it girl bring it to papa
YOU1000000169_S0000052	wow very well done
YOU1000000169_S0000053	that it might refer to an unfamiliar object
YOU1000000169_S0000055	chase get meow i want meow do it girl do it right now
YOU1000000169_S0000057	the way to solve the puzzle is by a process of elimination
YOU1000000169_S0000059	get meow do it do it
YOU1000000169_S0000061	there is meow come here
YOU1000000169_S0000062	after only one trial the new toy and the sound meow are lodged in her brain
YOU1000000169_S0000063	watch meow catch meow good girl
YOU1000000169_S0000065	and it just goes to show that you can teach an old dog new tricks to see african wild dogs in the flesh is a real privilege
YOU1000000169_S0000066	it is thought there may only be 3000 left in the wild making them one of the most endangered mammals in africa
YOU1000000169_S0000068	aladdin the alpha male wears the rager collar
YOU1000000169_S0000070	it really is quite fascinating to watch the alpha pair always together always together
YOU1000000169_S0000071	the male is constantly tailing behind her wherever she goes
YOU1000000169_S0000073	aladdin and feather have only been together for 4 months but they are already off to a flying start feather is visibly pregnant
YOU1000000169_S0000076	but even though he is now done the job she is pregnant with his pups he does not leave her side for one minute
YOU1000000169_S0000078	it is unusual for an alpha male to be so attentive at this stage aladdin seems to be a particularly devoted partner
YOU1000000169_S0000080	taryn has been monitoring feather and aladdin is progress from the start so tell me a little bit about how aladdin and feather behave with each other as the alpha pair
YOU1000000169_S0000081	we have often seen him with his chin resting on her rear end and just following her around he has been observed sleeping with his paw on her at night
YOU1000000169_S0000082	it is typical it is what we call mate guarding behavior he is looking after her he is making sure that she is fed and healthy
YOU1000000169_S0000083	once she is pregnant he continues to follow her even though he is already done his job and fathered her litter
YOU1000000169_S0000084	and i think that is his way of ensuring that his litter of pups survives and is healthy
YOU1000000169_S0000086	aladdin and feather look like a solid couple
YOU1000000169_S0000088	and that is good news for everyone else in the group
YOU1000000169_S0000090	because as the alpha pair it is their job to provide the pack with new pups
YOU1000000169_S0000092	so is that it are they completely established and their roles are determined and everything is hunky dory with the whole pack
YOU1000000169_S0000093	well so far so good the key will be how successful they are at raising that litter of pups as a pack
YOU1000000169_S0000094	the success of a pack always depends on their reproductive success so how well they work together to successfully rear their young
YOU1000000169_S0000095	so they are not home free
YOU1000000169_S0000096	not at all not at all
YOU1000000169_S0000097	so whenever you get a new alpha pair it does not mean anything until they have successfully reared their 1st litter their 1st litter 0 gosh no pressure
YOU1000000169_S0000099	fortunately for aladdin and feather the rest of the group will be there to lend a helping hand
YOU1000000169_S0000100	the other adult females are feather sisters and the males come from different packs
YOU1000000169_S0000102	here come the rest behind us
YOU1000000169_S0000103	it is one big happy family where everyone pitches in
YOU1000000169_S0000105	there are a few places on svalbard where people live year round one of them is the polish research station at hornisund
YOU1000000169_S0000107	they have had bears visit them this year but no fatal run ins thanks to a tried and tested polar bear warning system
YOU1000000169_S0000109	lola that is my daughter is name
YOU1000000169_S0000110	liliana kizlinka navrat has worked at the base for almost a year
YOU1000000169_S0000111	she is the bravest one
YOU1000000169_S0000112	so if a polar bear walks in the dogs start barking and they scare it off most times yes
YOU1000000169_S0000114	dogs like lola bark as soon as they get a whiff of a bear
YOU1000000169_S0000116	this gives the researchers time to come out with a flare gun and scare it off
YOU1000000169_S0000118	for lola here how close has she been to a polar bear
YOU1000000169_S0000119	well she was attacked 3 years ago
YOU1000000169_S0000120	was she
YOU1000000169_S0000121	yes she had some stitches on her here over here on the leg
YOU1000000169_S0000123	after she was attacked by the polar bear did her attitude change towards him was she more scared
YOU1000000169_S0000124	no she just got a lot braver
YOU1000000169_S0000125	she has got on with her job from the polar bears that you have seen come through here have you noticed that some are more curious that they do have different personalities
YOU1000000169_S0000127	yes yeah some are scared once and they go away but some are really just .
YOU1000000169_S0000129	so starving so hungry
YOU1000000169_S0000131	i do think it is great the way that the dog senses are used to keep people safe from polar bears they have got an excellent hearing fantastic sense of smell
YOU1000000169_S0000132	and there is absolutely no technology in the world that can detect polar bears as good as a dog can
YOU1000000169_S0000134	it is a small sign of hope there are ways to keep both people and polar bears safe
YOU1000000169_S0000136	max is a red collie cross normally full of energy and enthusiasm
YOU1000000169_S0000137	but in 2008 his owner maureen burns noticed that something was wrong
YOU1000000169_S0000139	i thought at the time max was fading he was 9.5
YOU1000000169_S0000141	and i was preparing myself for losing him because he just was not happy would not come with me would not sit by me would not sit on my lap
YOU1000000169_S0000143	and the odd signs he would come up
YOU1000000169_S0000145	and touch my breast with his nose
YOU1000000169_S0000147	and back off so desperately unhappy that there is such a sad look in his eyes
YOU1000000169_S0000149	maureen had a small lump in her breast but her latest mammogram was clear so she presumed all was okay
YOU1000000169_S0000151	initially i thought it is just another lumpy breast as people get
YOU1000000169_S0000153	but then .
YOU1000000169_S0000155	i sort of connected it with the dog with his odd behavior and one day i was looking in the mirror in the bedroom here
YOU1000000169_S0000157	and i looked across in the mirror at max is eyes he was on the bed as he is now and i knew it was cancer
YOU1000000169_S0000159	maureen went to her local hospital but both a scan and a mammogram came back negative
YOU1000000169_S0000161	it took a surgical biopsy to finally detect the cancer
YOU1000000169_S0000163	maureen had it removed and the change in max is behavior was instant
YOU1000000169_S0000165	the day i was picked up from the hospital
YOU1000000169_S0000167	he was his old hyper self again
YOU1000000169_S0000169	he put his nose across my breast to check where the operation had been and he was wagging his tail and his eyes were happy and
YOU1000000169_S0000170	it was unbelievable the change in him instant
YOU1000000169_S0000172	i love mac so much and i owe him so much
YOU1000000169_S0000174	and even before i go for a check up now i get him to check me out and if he is happy and wagging his tail i am happy
YOU1000000169_S0000175	and i know i am okay
YOU1000000169_S0000177	we now know that dogs like max are smelling the tiny volatile chemicals given off by cancerous tumors
YOU1000000169_S0000179	most dogs can do this they just do not know that we are interested
YOU1000000169_S0000181	but with a little training dogs can accurately pick out a cancerous patient from a selection of urine samples
YOU1000000169_S0000182	good girl good girl
YOU1000000169_S0000184	they can even be taught to let diabetics like stephen know that his blood sugar levels are smelling low long before he can feel it
YOU1000000169_S0000185	and definitely before he passes out
YOU1000000169_S0000187	dogs like stephen is are now transforming lives all over the country
YOU1000000169_S0000188	they are being trained to detect the early warning signals for severe allergic reactions epileptic fits and narcolepsy
YOU1000000170_S0000001	i worked at this place cwi
YOU1000000170_S0000002	and for my then current project which was the amoeba operating system which i was working under sapo mellander
YOU1000000170_S0000003	one of our projects was to write application level utilities
YOU1000000170_S0000004	for this new amoeba operating system
YOU1000000170_S0000005	and so there was an operating system kernel and it was very good at talking to the network
YOU1000000170_S0000006	and it was very good at managing processes but there was not much user level software
YOU1000000170_S0000007	there was barely a shell i think there was a ported very old unix shell something like the original unix version 6 shell
YOU1000000170_S0000008	but because the file system model on amoeba was so very different
YOU1000000170_S0000009	we could not take an existing suite of unix utilities
YOU1000000170_S0000010	and so we wanted it to be self hosting
YOU1000000170_S0000012	and in order to do that we realized we needed a large amount of user level sort of applications utilities tools
YOU1000000170_S0000013	whatever you call it from an editor to a mail program to a login utility and a backup tool
YOU1000000170_S0000014	and one of the things i realized as we had a small team of people sort of working on those things
YOU1000000170_S0000015	that it was very slow going writing all that stuff in c and it was not particularly interesting or sort of novel
YOU1000000170_S0000016	or difficult and often we also did not really care how fast the code ran
YOU1000000170_S0000017	all the reasons why you would write a piece of software in c did not really apply
YOU1000000170_S0000018	the only reason left was that c was the only language for which we had a compiler
YOU1000000170_S0000019	there was this abc language that i had in the back of my mind that would be a much better language to write
YOU1000000170_S0000020	a whole bunch of utility application tools for amoeba
YOU1000000170_S0000021	except that abc was so high and abstract that it really
YOU1000000170_S0000023	it was not a good language to talk to servers and file systems and processes
YOU1000000170_S0000024	the whole operating system was abstracted away from abc
YOU1000000170_S0000025	it was almost something like i do not know in an alternate universe abc could have become the language of spreadsheets
YOU1000000170_S0000026	it was very good for talking about a user is data
YOU1000000170_S0000027	and doing all sorts of clever stuff with that data
YOU1000000170_S0000028	it did that using very general all purpose data structures like lists and dictionaries
YOU1000000170_S0000029	and of course it had very nice code structuring devices
YOU1000000170_S0000030	like a small number of simple statements that could be combined in any way you wanted to create other constructs
YOU1000000170_S0000031	the usual function and procedure abstractions
YOU1000000170_S0000032	it was not at all an object oriented language although the implementation had some objects shining through
YOU1000000170_S0000033	anyway abcs .
YOU1000000170_S0000035	as it existed still was not usable
YOU1000000170_S0000036	but since i had worked on the abc project i knew exactly how it was built
YOU1000000170_S0000037	and i had this idea in my head that .
YOU1000000170_S0000039	given how much time we had available for our project i could actually build a whole new language design and implement it from scratch
YOU1000000170_S0000040	given what i learned about both the design and the implementation of abc and start using it to implement our suite of tools
YOU1000000170_S0000041	and still be ahead of the game compared to a situation where we would just have sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000043	clunked on writing the things we wanted to write in c
YOU1000000170_S0000044	for 3 months
YOU1000000170_S0000046	i did my day job and at night and whenever i got a chance i kept working on python
YOU1000000170_S0000047	i believe that within 3 months i was to the point where i could tell people look here this is what i built
YOU1000000170_S0000048	and it had an interactive interpreter loop
YOU1000000170_S0000049	so the 1st demos were all let us assign an expression to a variable and print it back
YOU1000000170_S0000051	and let us define a small function and call it and let us put some let us put some things in an array and iterate over the array
YOU1000000170_S0000053	and all those things worked
YOU1000000170_S0000055	and
YOU1000000170_S0000057	somehow and i do not exactly know how fast this happened but
YOU1000000170_S0000059	certainly my 2 office mates were almost instantly taken with it and started helping out
YOU1000000170_S0000061	and they and a few others within the institute were very excited about this thing that i built
YOU1000000170_S0000063	and started sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000065	we did not use it on amoeba because it was not mature enough to write the amoeba utilities we wanted
YOU1000000170_S0000066	but it was already instantly useful enough to run on our unix system
YOU1000000170_S0000067	people within cwi even outside my own department started using it
YOU1000000170_S0000068	and recognizing that it was fun and productive to use and they used it for small scripts
YOU1000000170_S0000069	and people started contributing things like
YOU1000000170_S0000071	bug fixes somehow things went very quickly during that 1st year
YOU1000000170_S0000072	by the end of 1990 a year after i started we developed a plan to do an open source release of this language
YOU1000000170_S0000074	and this was before the word open source had even been coined
YOU1000000170_S0000075	so we did not call it that but we did have some models we had like
YOU1000000170_S0000077	x 11 the windows system at the time
YOU1000000170_S0000078	had a distribution that was one of the sort of open source examples
YOU1000000170_S0000079	with 2 colleagues i worked on building a distribution
YOU1000000170_S0000080	actually it turned out to be very simple
YOU1000000170_S0000081	to get management to sign off on this release
YOU1000000170_S0000083	that was an incredibly lucky stroke
YOU1000000170_S0000084	i just sort of .
YOU1000000170_S0000086	i asked my manager is manager what shall we do about this
YOU1000000170_S0000087	and he said 0 you got to talk to this and this person in the administrative branch of the institute
YOU1000000170_S0000088	and i talked to this woman and she was in charge of all legal affairs i believe
YOU1000000170_S0000089	and i said well i have written this source code and i would like to release that and i have sort of .
YOU1000000170_S0000090	made up a license that is like identical to the mit license i could say mit releases software under exactly this license
YOU1000000170_S0000091	and we just put the formal name of our institute in there instead of the regions of the institute
YOU1000000170_S0000092	she asked me some questions like .
YOU1000000170_S0000094	did someone pay for this to be developed and my answer was no i started this all in my own time
YOU1000000170_S0000095	and it was for this research project that sort of
YOU1000000170_S0000097	my manager is fine with it
YOU1000000170_S0000099	and so she said sure go ahead and we did it
YOU1000000170_S0000101	and that is so that in february 91 we did the 1st python release
YOU1000000170_S0000103	and it felt like at the time like an incredible milestone we needed to post it to usenet
YOU1000000170_S0000104	there was this usenet news group that would receive source code for random free projects
YOU1000000170_S0000105	i got immediately started getting useful positive feedback from well initially just from random people
YOU1000000170_S0000106	who picked up free software from usenet
YOU1000000170_S0000107	we quickly sort of got into a routine of doing new python releases
YOU1000000170_S0000108	and every time
YOU1000000170_S0000110	i mean there were the obvious improvements to the language and the library and bug fixes a very important category of things that were often contributed
YOU1000000170_S0000111	were ports or porting fixes where people had different architectures different compilers
YOU1000000170_S0000112	the unix world was much less homogeneous at the time there were lots of small unix vendors that had their own compilers or their own hardware
YOU1000000170_S0000113	all sorts of things so the big things that happened
YOU1000000170_S0000114	during say the 1st half of the 90s was a community of python users and developers self organized
YOU1000000170_S0000115	then came the invitation to come to the united states for a couple months
YOU1000000170_S0000117	from nist the national institute for standards and technology so i spent 2 months there
YOU1000000170_S0000118	we organized the 1st python workshop which was hosted by nist
YOU1000000170_S0000119	through that python workshop i met people who offered me a job and from 1995 i mean i went back to the netherlands for a few months and then from 1995 to 2000
YOU1000000170_S0000120	i worked in the us in northern virginia at cnri
YOU1000000170_S0000122	and so there we worked through a lot of growth of the community and the infrastructure we created the python website
YOU1000000170_S0000123	i got in touch with a bunch of people who are still active in the python community like barry warsaw
YOU1000000170_S0000124	i think when i started there python one.3 was about to be released
YOU1000000170_S0000126	and then while i was there we released several subsequent versions leading up to one.5.2
YOU1000000170_S0000127	which for some reason 150 was nothing
YOU1000000170_S0000128	but 152 remained the gold standard of python for a very long time afterwards
YOU1000000171_S0000001	but get back to the standardization we are standardizing c under iso rules which are very open process
YOU1000000171_S0000002	people come in there is no requirements for education or experience
YOU1000000171_S0000003	so you started to develop c and there is a whole what was the 1st standard established what is that like
YOU1000000171_S0000004	the iso standard is their committee that you are referring to there is a group of people what was that like how often do you meet what is the discussion
YOU1000000171_S0000005	i will try and explain that so sometime in early 1989
YOU1000000171_S0000006	2 people one from ibm one from hp turned up in my office and told me i would like to standardize c
YOU1000000171_S0000008	this was a new idea to me and i pointed out that it was not finished yet and it was not ready for formal standardization
YOU1000000171_S0000009	and they say no bjarne you have not gotten it you really want to do this our organizations depend on c
YOU1000000171_S0000010	we cannot depend on something that is owned by another corporation that might be a competitor of course we could rely on you
YOU1000000171_S0000011	but you might get run over by a bus
YOU1000000171_S0000013	we really need to get this out in the open it has to be standardized under formal rules
YOU1000000171_S0000014	and we are going to standardize it under iso rules
YOU1000000171_S0000015	and you really want to be part of it because basically otherwise we will do it ourselves
YOU1000000171_S0000017	and we know you can do it better so through a combination of arm twisting and flattery
YOU1000000171_S0000019	so in late .
YOU1000000171_S0000021	in late 89 there was a meeting in dc at the actually no it was not iso then it was ansi
YOU1000000171_S0000022	the american national standard we are doing
YOU1000000171_S0000024	we met there we were lectured on the rules of how to do an nc standard there was about 25 of us there
YOU1000000171_S0000025	which apparently was a new record for that kind of meeting and some of the old c guys that has been standardizing c was there so we got some expertise in
YOU1000000171_S0000026	so the way this works is that it is an open process anybody can sign up if they pay the minimal fee
YOU1000000171_S0000027	which is about a $1000 a little bit more now
YOU1000000171_S0000028	and i think it is $1280 it is not going to kill you and we have 3 meetings a year
YOU1000000171_S0000029	this is fairly standard we tried 2 meetings a year for a couple of years that did not work too well so 3123
YOU1000000171_S0000031	week meetings a year
YOU1000000171_S0000033	and you meet and you have technical discussions and then you bring proposals forward for votes
YOU1000000171_S0000034	the votes are done one person per
YOU1000000171_S0000036	one vote per organization so you can not have say ibm come in with 10 people and dominate things that is not allowed
YOU1000000171_S0000037	and these are organizations that extends to the uc
YOU1000000171_S0000039	or individuals
YOU1000000171_S0000040	or individuals i mean it is a bunch of people in a room deciding the design of a language based on which a lot of the world is systems run
YOU1000000171_S0000041	that is right well i think most people would agree it is better than if i decided it
YOU1000000171_S0000042	or better than if a single organization like at t decides it
YOU1000000171_S0000043	i do not know if everyone agrees to that by the way bureaucracies have their critics too
YOU1000000171_S0000044	yes they are the look standardization is not pleasant it is horrifying
YOU1000000171_S0000045	it is like democracy
YOU1000000171_S0000046	but we exactly as churchill says democracy is the worst way except for all the others right
YOU1000000171_S0000047	and it is i would say the same with formal standardization but anyway so we meet and we have these votes
YOU1000000171_S0000049	and that determines what the standard is a couple of years later we extended this so it became worldwide
YOU1000000171_S0000050	we have standard organizations that are active in
YOU1000000171_S0000052	currently 15 to 20 countries and another
YOU1000000171_S0000054	15 to 20 are sort of looking and voting
YOU1000000171_S0000056	based on the rest of the work on it and we meet 3 times a year next week i will be in cologne germany
YOU1000000171_S0000057	spending a week doing standardization and we will vote out the committee draft of c 20
YOU1000000171_S0000059	which goes to the national standards committees for comments and requests for changes
YOU1000000171_S0000060	improvements then we do that and there is a 2nd set of votes where hopefully everybody votes in favor this has happened several times
YOU1000000171_S0000061	the 1st time we finished we started in the 1st technical meeting was in 1990 the last was in 98
YOU1000000171_S0000062	we voted it out that was the standard that people used till 11 or a little bit past 11 and it was an international standard
YOU1000000171_S0000063	all the countries voted in favor it took longer with 11 and i will mention why
YOU1000000171_S0000064	but all the nations voted in favor and we work on the basis of consensus
YOU1000000171_S0000065	that is we do not want something that passes 60 40 because then we are getting dial ins and opponents and people complain too much
YOU1000000171_S0000066	they will not complain too much but basically it has no real effect the standards have been obeyed
YOU1000000171_S0000067	they have been working to make it easier to use many compilers many computers and all of that kind of stuff
YOU1000000171_S0000069	and so the 1st it was traditional with iso standards to take 10 years we did the 1st one in 8 brilliant
YOU1000000171_S0000071	and we thought we were going to do the next one in 6 because now we are good at it
YOU1000000171_S0000072	right
YOU1000000171_S0000073	it choked
YOU1000000171_S0000075	13
YOU1000000171_S0000076	yeah it was named ox
YOU1000000171_S0000077	the
YOU1000000171_S0000078	i thought we would get 67 or 8 the confidence of youth
YOU1000000171_S0000079	yes right well the point is that this was sort of like a 2nd system effect that is we now knew how to do it and so we are going to do it much better
YOU1000000171_S0000080	and we got more ambitious and it took longer furthermore there is this tendency because it is a 10 year cycle
YOU1000000171_S0000082	or age does not matter
YOU1000000171_S0000084	just before you are about to ship somebody has a bright idea
YOU1000000171_S0000086	yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000087	and so we really really must
YOU1000000171_S0000089	get that in
YOU1000000171_S0000091	we did that successfully with the stl
YOU1000000171_S0000093	stl stuff that basically i think it saves you
YOU1000000171_S0000094	it was beautiful
YOU1000000171_S0000095	yes and then people tried it with other things and it did not work so well they got things in but it was not as dramatic
YOU1000000171_S0000096	and it took longer and longer and longer
YOU1000000171_S0000098	so after c 11 which was a huge improvement and basically what most people are using today
YOU1000000171_S0000100	we decided never again
YOU1000000171_S0000102	and so how do you avoid those slips and the answer is that you ship more often
YOU1000000171_S0000103	so that if you have a slip on a 10 year cycle
YOU1000000171_S0000105	by the time you know it is a slip there is 11 years till you get it
YOU1000000171_S0000106	yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000107	now with a 3 year cycle there is about 4 years till you get it
YOU1000000171_S0000108	like yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000109	the delay between feature freeze and shipping so you always get one or 2 years more
YOU1000000171_S0000110	and so we shipped 14 on time we shipped 17 on time and we will ship 20 on time
YOU1000000171_S0000112	it will happen and furthermore this gives a predictability that allows the implementers the compiler implementers the library implementers
YOU1000000171_S0000113	so they have a target and they deliver on it 11 took 2 years for most compilers were good enough
YOU1000000171_S0000115	most compilers were actually getting pretty good in 14 17 everybody shipped in 17
YOU1000000171_S0000116	wow
YOU1000000171_S0000117	we are going to have .
YOU1000000171_S0000119	at least almost everybody ship almost everything in 20 and i know this because they are shipping in 19
YOU1000000171_S0000121	predictability is good delivery on time is good and so yeah
YOU1000000171_S0000122	that is great
YOU1000000171_S0000123	that is how it works
YOU1000000172_S0000001	okay i am going to unbox our own plants
YOU1000000172_S0000002	i just got them and not this dog brush my husband just gave me that but i figured let me just do this and show you the reality
YOU1000000172_S0000003	0 i can not show you my address i am going to have to do it in a way that wait a minute this actually might be some of my clothing
YOU1000000172_S0000005	this is some of my clothing this is clothing that i shipped back from when i was in florida so that is not a plant but this is a plant this is a plant
YOU1000000172_S0000006	so i do not use scissors i use my fingernails maybe it is cringy for you but that is how i open up tape i just kind of rip it open like that
YOU1000000172_S0000007	you know i still get excited opening up plants even though i ship a lot of plants ooh ooh i am excited
YOU1000000172_S0000009	like i need more plants i do need more plants i was just thinking to myself i need quite a few more plants because when i was not here i was not here for quite a long time during the pandemic i was in florida and i really could not come back home
YOU1000000172_S0000010	so it was a really difficult time but at the same time i gave a lot of my plants to friends and family because it was not fair that my husband was taking care of them
YOU1000000172_S0000011	so i got rid of them and now i regret it so i have see this is these are 4 plants in one box and i am going to show you what we have
YOU1000000172_S0000012	i am excited i kind of know what they are but they were shipped to me because i need to have them here because i need plants i need plants
YOU1000000172_S0000013	need more flats you can cut the string if you want but i would like to not cut the string because i like to use it
YOU1000000172_S0000014	so i just gently release
YOU1000000172_S0000016	the
YOU1000000172_S0000018	cord edge
YOU1000000172_S0000019	and then do that
YOU1000000172_S0000020	and so i just want to reuse these sleeves too so i try to be as careful as i can and pull it from the bottom like this
YOU1000000172_S0000022	let us see okay come on come on you can do this do not rip it and i use my hand and i just 0 this is a morgan hair fern
YOU1000000172_S0000023	it is little it is cute and i have some wrap around it that keeps the soil down
YOU1000000172_S0000024	for now we are trying to work on having just all natural materials and we are getting to that point but you can recycle that and then you just take the paper away
YOU1000000172_S0000025	yeah shredded paper is what really helps keep the soil down and this came this showed up pretty nicely look at that it is just a couple of little leaves a couple of little leaves did not do so well
YOU1000000172_S0000026	but the soil is nice and moist it still looks pretty good there is just 11 little stem that did not make it that happens sometimes when you get plants in the mail
YOU1000000172_S0000027	but look at that i cleaned it up a little bit to show you the maidenhair fern it traveled pretty well i am pretty excited about that

YOU1000000174_S0000029	it is completely full right now as soon as one goes out another one comes in they are all covid positive every single one of them
YOU1000000174_S0000030	so 12

YOU1000000174_S0000033	i need 3 more dividers then right
YOU1000000174_S0000035	everyone is getting sick with covid at the same time so our staff are calling out faster than we can get staff in
YOU1000000174_S0000036	we have received a couple traveler nurses from the state of california recently which is wonderful but the hard part is that everyone is fighting for the same resources at the same time
YOU1000000174_S0000038	all of the hospitals in california are struggling
YOU1000000174_S0000040	we have the medications we need that the fda has approved we have convalescent plasma for patients
YOU1000000174_S0000041	we have all the things that we did not have previously and patients still it is effective but these patients are just sicker i do not even know how to explain it it seems that once we get folks on a ventilator it is really hard to get them off
YOU1000000174_S0000043	where is the a line straight over in the center
YOU1000000174_S0000045	just keep it up
YOU1000000174_S0000047	he is a person happens to be a neighbor of mine we have had family friends here we have had people that i have known some people succeed and some people you know
YOU1000000174_S0000048	unfortunately covid is a tragic process
YOU1000000174_S0000050	i have seen approximately 10 people that i know or that are family friends or neighbors 33 unfortunately have passed
YOU1000000174_S0000051	so on 3 it is tough it is tough seeing all that
YOU1000000174_S0000053	there is a lot of weight on the shoulders that we all carry it is depressing but we are all hopeful that is the thing i think that we all cling on to hope
YOU1000000174_S0000055	i am a religious man so i pray while i can i go home to my family and i look at them and that is what brings me happiness that is what gets me out of my little depression
YOU1000000174_S0000059	i am very tired today i do not even know what day in a row we have been working
YOU1000000174_S0000060	i have been working 12 15 hours every day as we all have been we are here on weekends we are here on nights
YOU1000000174_S0000061	we are watching over each other but you know we are pouring our hearts out to the patients and the staff it is hard i am tired
YOU1000000174_S0000063	there is still a lot of misunderstanding potentially in the community about how it spreads how people are getting it
YOU1000000174_S0000064	i do not think they realize how hard it is for the families when you see them come in here and hold the hand of their loved one that is about to die
YOU1000000174_S0000066	we have done a lot of work around vaccine planning but also realistically it is not going to be available to community members right away
YOU1000000174_S0000067	this is going to take months it is going to take months for it to get better
YOU1000000174_S0000069	you need to wear your mask you need to social distance you need to wash your hands
YOU1000000174_S0000070	you really need to follow the science and the guidelines that are being put forward
YOU1000000174_S0000071	we as health care workers and caregivers are doing everything we can to keep people safe to take care of them while they are here in the hospital
YOU1000000174_S0000072	but if so many people come in and keep coming in like this it worries me that we are not going to be able to keep you or any of your loved ones safe any longer
YOU1000000175_S0000000	myths and rumors circulate in a very similar way to the way that microbes spread they can be contagious in that one person hears something
YOU1000000175_S0000001	they pass it on to another person and another and suddenly a rumor becomes really well established and i think we have always had this problem
YOU1000000175_S0000002	but with the internet and social media just the scale the scope and the speed of it is really amped up i am doctor seema yasmin and i am a doctor
YOU1000000175_S0000003	a professor at stanford school of medicine and director of the stanford center for health communication and i am going to debunk some illness and disease myths
YOU1000000175_S0000005	people kind of want to know exactly how much water should i be drinking but there is not that magic number
YOU1000000175_S0000006	i think this myth has been circulating for a long time and somehow 8 glasses of an 8 ounce glass specifically is what is circulated
YOU1000000175_S0000007	it depends on your body size and how active you are at a given time
YOU1000000175_S0000009	there is no reason to eat your placenta i do hear from people that they want to eat their placenta
YOU1000000175_S0000010	because monkeys or other wild animals do it but the reason that those animals are doing it is because they do not want to attract predators
YOU1000000175_S0000011	there is no reason for a human to eat a placenta
YOU1000000175_S0000013	your heart does not skip a beat when you sneeze i think a lot of us grow up hearing things about sneezing that your eyes close
YOU1000000175_S0000014	and your heart skips a beat and you are like dead for a millisecond or something yeah clearly not true
YOU1000000175_S0000016	adults have fewer bones than babies and that is actually true because babies are born with some bones that fuse to become a bigger bone
YOU1000000175_S0000018	there is a phenomenon known as the july effect which wonders and asks this question that if you have massive turnover
YOU1000000175_S0000019	new residents starting new faculty starting around july then is not that a more dangerous time to be in hospital and there have been 300 studies looking into this
YOU1000000175_S0000020	and it turns out that it depends on what kind of hospital it is who you are being looked after like how experienced they are but also what kind of illness you are and how seriously sick you are
YOU1000000175_S0000021	the take home from this is that if you are sick in july you still need to go to a hospital and by and large you are in good hands
YOU1000000175_S0000023	so your body makes toxins as it metabolizes different things but the thing is your body also flushes those things out
YOU1000000175_S0000024	you do not need to be doing anything or taking anything to cleanse yourself flat tummy tea is most of them are not good for you
YOU1000000175_S0000025	they kind of go under this umbrella of 0 well it is natural or it is herbal but those herbs are no joke sometimes flat tummy teas contain senna
YOU1000000175_S0000026	which yes it is a herb but it is also a laxative so if you want to crap the way out i mean all you are doing is emptying your bowels and becoming dehydrated
YOU1000000175_S0000028	your body does have waste products in it that is why you pee and that is why you poop and even when you breathe you are exhaling carbon dioxide which is a waste product
YOU1000000175_S0000029	but your body is perfectly primed to do that to get rid of what you do not need people do ask about colonics you do not need them
YOU1000000175_S0000030	you do not need to put coffee up your butt you do not need to be shoving liquids up there to get anything out unless of course you have constipation and the doctor prescribes an enema but if you are healthy and functioning fine then you do not need to do a colonic
YOU1000000175_S0000032	people are making 10s of dollars off dietary supplements that many of us do not need and that includes vitamins
YOU1000000175_S0000033	if you are eating a well balanced diet you are getting the vitamins that you need and you do not need to be popping a pill to stay healthy
YOU1000000175_S0000034	you need to take a vitamin if your health care provider tells you you have a deficiency and you need to top up and take a pill or take a liquid that boosts your level of that vitamin
YOU1000000175_S0000036	msg is not addictive it is not unsafe and the thing that i was fascinated with when i was writing this was that those myths that you have heard about msg
YOU1000000175_S0000037	that it is addictive that it is really bad for you are all tied to racism and the fact that it was chinese people owning chinese restaurants that were using it and that is how it got labeled as something that was dirty and toxic
YOU1000000175_S0000038	in moderation it is no worse for you than regular salt
YOU1000000175_S0000040	people have asked me if genetically modified food is safe whether it should pay more for non gmo food pay more for organic food but gmo food is safe
YOU1000000175_S0000041	and the definition of organic honestly can be so broad and vague and different from one place to another that most doctors will say
YOU1000000175_S0000042	just eat a healthy balanced varied diet and you do not necessarily need to pay more for organic for most foods
YOU1000000175_S0000044	i do get asked about artificial sweeteners a lot because a lot of my friends like to chug diet sodas the thing to bear in mind here is that some of the studies are not that robust
YOU1000000175_S0000045	so you might have seen headlines saying diet sodas cause alzheimer is disease or diet soda causes stroke
YOU1000000175_S0000046	and they are not necessarily true and the thing that i worry about then is will people ditch the diet soda and just start drinking sugary soda when we know that those are linked to diabetes and other illnesses
YOU1000000175_S0000047	artificial sweeteners the kind that you find in diet sodas do not cause alzheimer is disease
YOU1000000175_S0000049	stroke and cancer you may have seen headlines that say that but i think that they are misconstruing what the scientific studies are really showing
YOU1000000175_S0000050	there have been studies showing some harmful effects of artificial sweeteners in rats
YOU1000000175_S0000051	but then you have to take that with a large grain of salt to say that well just because it did something in a rodent is body will that translate into happening in a human is body
YOU1000000175_S0000052	but if you want to be really careful you can just drink water
YOU1000000175_S0000055	that is a great message
YOU1000000175_S0000057	you are a little bit taller 1st thing in the morning probably no more than a centimeter though and that is just because gravity compresses your joints during the course of the day
YOU1000000175_S0000058	it is also why when astronauts come back to earth after a space mission they are a little bit taller than when they left earth
YOU1000000175_S0000060	there are studies showing that bad teeth especially bad gums can lead to heart disease and make you more susceptible and that is because of the bacteria
YOU1000000175_S0000061	that causes gum disease can circulate through the blood and cause illness elsewhere it is certainly something that makes us look at the patient holistically
YOU1000000175_S0000062	so it is important to get your blood pressure checked and it is important to eat well but it is also really important to get good dental hygiene and get routine checkups to make sure your gums are as healthy as everything else
YOU1000000175_S0000064	there are some studies that are quite exciting that show that aspirin which we already recommend for a number of things might lower the risk of cancer
YOU1000000175_S0000065	but there is still more research being done and there are not a ton of medical organizations saying hey everyone should take an aspirin pill every day to prevent cancer
YOU1000000175_S0000066	what we are learning is that it is certain types of cancer in particular and that there might be something about aspirin that prevents metastatic cancer that prevents cancer cells from moving around the body
YOU1000000175_S0000067	but even in that case it might be that the aspirin works for that only in some people and not in everyone
YOU1000000175_S0000068	i get so many questions about aspirin because it feels like every year we discover a new use for it it is an incredible incredible drug
YOU1000000175_S0000069	but the jury is still out on aspirin preventing cancer
YOU1000000175_S0000071	please do not stop taking an antibiotic the moment you feel better if you still have more to complete the course it is really important that if you have 10 days of pills
YOU1000000175_S0000072	but you feel better on day 4 or day 3 even you still have to finish that course of antibiotics so that the bug does not become resistant to the medicine
YOU1000000175_S0000074	antibiotics cannot help with a cold most colds most sore throats are caused by viruses and antibiotics will not do anything to those
YOU1000000175_S0000075	antibiotics fight bacteria very specifically so if you have a virus circulating in your blood taking an antibiotic will not help
YOU1000000175_S0000077	it has been circulating for ages that you should starve a fever and feed a cold you just need to eat well and stay hydrated when you are not well
YOU1000000175_S0000078	it is dangerous to starve yourself like that is a thing that we know that is proven so if you have a fever stay hydrated and eat well
YOU1000000175_S0000080	the flu shot can definitely not cause the flu the flu shot might make you achy but for the vast majority of us getting the flu shot is a fantastic idea
YOU1000000175_S0000081	you will not get the flu from it and it will keep you safe
YOU1000000175_S0000083	i think we all grew up hearing that you should never go outside in the cold when your hair is wet or like make sure you bundle up and our mothers love doing that to us
YOU1000000175_S0000084	during cold times is when there are more cold bugs circulating anyway and also there is some research that shows that cold weather might impact the immune system
YOU1000000175_S0000085	but i do not know if it is that robust i think it is still a good idea though to wrap up very warm
YOU1000000175_S0000087	you do not lose more heat from your head than anywhere else on your body
YOU1000000175_S0000089	you can tell a little bit about what is making somebody sick from looking at the color of their sputum which is the disgusting thing that you cough up
YOU1000000175_S0000090	for example if it is very clear that is less likely to be an infection usually if it is green or yellow more likely to be a bacterial or viral infection
YOU1000000175_S0000091	i think doctors are good at assessing the color of sputum when people are coughing up out of their lungs if you are emptying your nose into a tissue
YOU1000000175_S0000092	probably looking at the color to try and figure out exactly what bacteria is causing it that is not going to be something you can assess
YOU1000000175_S0000094	people wonder if their ears stop growing when the rest of them stops growing and actually your ears carry on growing forever
YOU1000000175_S0000096	so the current guidelines in the us are that men who have sex with men can only donate blood if they have been celibate for 12 months which is ludicrous and stupid and unscientific
YOU1000000175_S0000097	it was not until 2015 30 years after we had a test for hiv aids
YOU1000000175_S0000098	that gay men and bisexual men were told yes you can donate blood but there was a major caveat
YOU1000000175_S0000099	and that caveat was that men who have sex with men could only donate blood if they had been celibate for 12 months
YOU1000000175_S0000101	vaccines do not cause autism i may get that tattooed on my face at some point in 2020 i am kind of being sarcastic here
YOU1000000175_S0000102	that if a patient was to ask me that i would take their concerns really seriously and not be dismissive because i want to know why they think that and i want to make sure that i reassure them
YOU1000000175_S0000103	that vaccines are safe and what they cause is a long life and good health
YOU1000000175_S0000105	the best way to disinfect your hands is to wash them very well with water and soap and then to rub them clean
YOU1000000175_S0000107	hand sanitizer is good if you are in a bind but it is nowhere near as good as washing your hands with soap and water i get asked a lot of questions about alcohol gel
YOU1000000175_S0000108	hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes and they are really useful they do disinfect surfaces
YOU1000000175_S0000109	but nothing is equivalent to disinfecting your hands as washing them with soap and water
YOU1000000175_S0000111	it is true that many patients cared for by a female doctor have better health outcomes there have been a number of studies that show that the patients do better
YOU1000000175_S0000112	they live longer they are less likely to be readmitted to the hospital if they are cared for by a doctor who is a woman
YOU1000000175_S0000113	and at the same time women doctors face lots of discrimination and get paid less than our male counterparts
YOU1000000175_S0000115	it is hard to avoid misinformation sometimes there is so much false health news circulating
YOU1000000175_S0000116	and sometimes you can just feel overwhelmed even with the correct information i think the important thing to do is to talk to a health care provider that you feel like you can trust
YOU1000000175_S0000117	who has an open mind and someone that gives you the time and space to talk about what is really concerning you
YOU1000000176_S0000001	cells are the smallest living units of an organism
YOU1000000176_S0000003	all cells have 3 things in common no matter what type of cell they are
YOU1000000176_S0000005	all cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of the cell from its environment
YOU1000000176_S0000007	cytoplasm which is a jelly like fluid and dna which is the cell is genetic material
YOU1000000176_S0000009	there are 2 broad categories of cells
YOU1000000176_S0000011	the 1st category is eukaryotic cells they have organelles which include the nucleus and other special parts
YOU1000000176_S0000013	eukaryotic cells are more advanced complex cells such as those found in plants and animals
YOU1000000176_S0000015	the 2nd category is prokaryotic cells
YOU1000000176_S0000016	they do not have a nucleus or membrane enclosed organelles
YOU1000000176_S0000017	they do have genetic material but it is not contained within a nucleus
YOU1000000176_S0000018	prokaryotic cells are always one celled or unicellular organisms such as bacteria
YOU1000000176_S0000020	so what are organelles
YOU1000000176_S0000021	organelle means little organ
YOU1000000176_S0000023	organelles are the specialized parts of a cell that have unique jobs to perform
YOU1000000176_S0000025	let us start with the nucleus the control center of the cell
YOU1000000176_S0000027	the nucleus contains dna or genetic material
YOU1000000176_S0000028	dna dictates what the cell is going to do and how it is going to do it
YOU1000000176_S0000029	chromatin is the tangled spread out form of dna found inside the nuclear membrane
YOU1000000176_S0000031	when a cell is ready to divide dna condenses into structures known as chromosomes
YOU1000000176_S0000033	the nucleus also contains a nucleolus
YOU1000000176_S0000035	which is a structure where ribosomes are made
YOU1000000176_S0000037	after ribosomes leave the nucleus they will have the important job of synthesizing or making proteins
YOU1000000176_S0000039	outside the nucleus the ribosomes and the rest of the organelles float around in cytoplasm which is the jelly like substance
YOU1000000176_S0000041	ribosomes may wander freely within the cytoplasm
YOU1000000176_S0000043	or attach to the endoplasmic reticulum sometimes abbreviated as er
YOU1000000176_S0000044	there are 2 types of er rough has ribosomes attached to it
YOU1000000176_S0000045	and smooth does not have ribosomes attached to it
YOU1000000176_S0000047	the endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane enclosed passageway for transporting materials such as the proteins synthesized by ribosomes
YOU1000000176_S0000049	proteins and other materials emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum in small vesicles
YOU1000000176_S0000051	where the golgi apparatus sometimes called the golgi body receives them
YOU1000000176_S0000053	as proteins move through the golgi body they are customized into forms that the cell can use
YOU1000000176_S0000055	the golgi body does this by folding the proteins into usable shapes
YOU1000000176_S0000056	or adding other materials onto them such as lipids
YOU1000000176_S0000058	or carbohydrates
YOU1000000176_S0000060	vacuoles are sac like structures that store different materials
YOU1000000176_S0000061	here in this plant cell the central vacuole stores water
YOU1000000176_S0000063	going back to the animal cell you will see an organelle called a lysosome
YOU1000000176_S0000064	lysosomes are the garbage collectors that take in damaged or worn out cell parts
YOU1000000176_S0000065	they are filled with enzymes that break down this cellular debris
YOU1000000176_S0000067	the mitochondrion is an organelle that is the powerhouse for both animal and plant cells
YOU1000000176_S0000069	during a process called cellular respiration the mitochondria make atp molecules that provide the energy for all of the cell is activities
YOU1000000176_S0000071	cells that need more energy have more mitochondria
YOU1000000176_S0000073	meanwhile the cell maintains its shape through a cytoskeleton
YOU1000000176_S0000075	the cytoskeleton includes the thread like microfilaments which are made of protein
YOU1000000176_S0000077	and microtubules which are thin hollow tubes
YOU1000000176_S0000079	some organisms such as plants that are photoautotrophic
YOU1000000176_S0000081	meaning they capture sunlight for energy
YOU1000000176_S0000083	have cells with an organelle called a chloroplast
YOU1000000176_S0000085	the chloroplast is where photosynthesis happens
YOU1000000176_S0000087	it is green because it has a green pigment called chlorophyll
YOU1000000176_S0000089	plant cells also have a cell wall outside of their cell membranes that shape support and protect the plant cell
YOU1000000176_S0000091	animal cells never have a cell wall
YOU1000000176_S0000093	there are many other unique structures that only some cells have
YOU1000000176_S0000095	here are just a few in humans for example the respiratory tract is lined with cells that have cilia
YOU1000000176_S0000096	these are microscopic hair like projections that can move in waves
YOU1000000176_S0000097	this feature helps trap inhaled particles in the air and expels them when you cough
YOU1000000176_S0000099	another unique feature in some cells is flagella some bacteria have flagella
YOU1000000176_S0000100	a flagellum is like a little tail that can help a cell move or propel itself
YOU1000000176_S0000102	the only human cell that has a flagellum is a sperm cell
YOU1000000176_S0000104	in summary remember .
YOU1000000176_S0000105	eukaryotic cells are plant and animal cells with a nucleus and membrane enclosed organelles
YOU1000000176_S0000107	while prokaryotic cells are unicellular organisms without these things
YOU1000000176_S0000109	all cells have a cell membrane cytoplasm and genetic material
YOU1000000176_S0000111	and even though only plant cells have chloroplasts both plant and animal cells have mitochondria
YOU1000000177_S0000000	coffee did you know that over 40 cups of coffee are consumed every year

YOU1000000177_S0000028	these overall studies show that coffee is good for your heart brain and your body the best time of day to drink coffee is around one hour after waking up or 30 minutes before your workout
YOU1000000177_S0000029	use a drip coffee maker if possible other popular machines use plastic cups that are unrecyclable and are very damaging to our planet
YOU1000000177_S0000030	how much per day is okay a short rule of thumb is 2 cups a day is fine 3 cups a day is good and 4 cups a day should be the absolute max
YOU1000000177_S0000031	finally drink your coffee black most of the specialty drinks at coffee shops are calorie nightmares and are basically glorified milkshakes
YOU1000000177_S0000032	drinking it black takes some time to get used to but just like an acquired taste to wine it gets better with time
YOU1000000177_S0000033	got a topic you want the health nerd to cover just put it in the comment section below and according to the latest research for every new subscriber i get an adorable baby sloth is born

YOU1000000178_S0000000	we use the pouring technique to create a lovely pattern on the surface of the drink
YOU1000000178_S0000002	and i am not even going to give you guys a chance to get a picture of this because it does not match our standards
YOU1000000178_S0000004	hello my name is michael phillips i am the 2010 world barista champion and the director of education for blue bottle coffee internationally
YOU1000000178_S0000005	and today we are going to talk about how to make a cappuccino
YOU1000000178_S0000006	now for cappuccino you have got some core ingredients we have got some wonderful coffee today we are using the hayes valley espresso
YOU1000000178_S0000007	you have delicious ice cold milk you have got of course water being plumbed into your equipment and you will have all the tools you need to make that same delicious drink that we make for you in our shops
YOU1000000178_S0000008	one of the defining characteristics of a cappuccino is that it is about a 5 to 6 ounce beverage so it is usually nice and proper that keeps the ratio nice and tight
YOU1000000178_S0000009	so the very 1st step
YOU1000000178_S0000011	because we want to make sure that our cup is nice and hot
YOU1000000178_S0000013	i am going to add a little water off the machine here this is going to keep it at a high temperature
YOU1000000178_S0000015	so that it maintains all of the heat and we do not have to take our milk to such a high temperature which lets us keep a little bit more of the sweetness out of it
YOU1000000178_S0000017	the next step we want to get our puck ready so this is referred to as a portafilter you got the basket right here
YOU1000000178_S0000019	this is where you are going to put your coffee that you have ground and are preparing to extract
YOU1000000178_S0000020	you want to make sure it is nice and clean and dry which is what we use our portafilter towel for
YOU1000000178_S0000021	and we are really precise about this so we actually use digital scales to measure the weight to make sure we are super specific on it down to the 10th of a gram
YOU1000000178_S0000023	got our grinder here i am going to run just a little bit through to make sure everything we are getting is nice and fresh
YOU1000000178_S0000025	so our grinder is going to dose a timed out version of coffee into here
YOU1000000178_S0000026	but it is probably not as precise as we want so we double check so right now i am at 19.5 i want to add a little bit more
YOU1000000178_S0000028	and there we go now i am at 26 so i have to use this process this next step is called leveling
YOU1000000178_S0000029	and that is where we shift the coffee grounds around the top of the basket to try and get a nice and even surface
YOU1000000178_S0000030	so the next step you want to compress this bed of coffee down just a little bit
YOU1000000178_S0000031	to do that we use this right here this is a tamper
YOU1000000178_S0000032	it is like a chef is knife everybody has one that fits their hand just right
YOU1000000178_S0000033	you want to make sure your portafilter is nice and level you want a line coming straight up from that through your elbow
YOU1000000178_S0000034	and then you compact it
YOU1000000178_S0000036	nice and evenly
YOU1000000178_S0000037	the most important part is you want to make sure it is nice and level
YOU1000000178_S0000039	because that is going to affect how fast the water goes through the various parts of the puck
YOU1000000178_S0000040	so now that we have the portafilter tamped we are ready to lock it in and start pulling your shots
YOU1000000178_S0000042	so we want to get the water out of that cup
YOU1000000178_S0000043	again we have got another scale up here
YOU1000000178_S0000044	the 3 big variables we pay attention to is the dose so the amount of coffee the yield the amount of espresso going into the cup
YOU1000000178_S0000045	and the time that it takes i have got a little timer right here
YOU1000000178_S0000046	so flush a little water through the group head
YOU1000000178_S0000048	we will lock it in nice and tight and then we are going to pull that shot
YOU1000000178_S0000049	now for the hayes valley this is a very very tight extraction right
YOU1000000178_S0000050	20 grams of coffee in for 20 grams of coffee out that is what we would refer to as a reasonably short shot
YOU1000000178_S0000051	but we want to slow that extraction process down so we are aiming for about 30 to 35 seconds overall time to get it to taste just right
YOU1000000178_S0000052	now the time it takes for that to happen is what is really going to affect the flavor
YOU1000000178_S0000053	a low 22nd shot is going to be a very sour unbalanced shot
YOU1000000178_S0000054	for the haze we tend to like something between 30 and 35 seconds to get that nice chocolatey really clean flavor
YOU1000000178_S0000055	if you go a little bit longer than that say 40 seconds or even higher than that the shots can start to taste excessively bitter
YOU1000000178_S0000057	33 seconds right in the pocket
YOU1000000178_S0000058	so as you can see that is a really nice lovely shot that we have there
YOU1000000178_S0000059	so now that we have got a well prepared shot that falls into the parameters just the way we want we are going to steam up some milk and finish up this cappuccino
YOU1000000178_S0000061	now when you are steaming you want to take this steam on tip that has a few little holes in it that that hot air jets out through
YOU1000000178_S0000062	and you want to have it right at the surface of the milk in your pitcher because that is going to let it whip in the air to create the texture that you are looking for
YOU1000000178_S0000063	once you have added the desired amount of texture you are going to lift that pitcher up so that it is not whipping in any more air but it is still bringing that temperature up right into the zone that you want
YOU1000000178_S0000064	steaming is going to be really quick it is going to take about 5 to 6 seconds on this machine
YOU1000000178_S0000065	home machines may take a little bit longer but overall this is one of those experiences where most people you know you blink and it is done you wonder what happened so we have it adjusted right there i have got that tip at the surface
YOU1000000178_S0000067	and turn that on
YOU1000000178_S0000068	you hear that air whipping in you do not want to do too much
YOU1000000178_S0000069	and then
YOU1000000178_S0000071	that quick you want to make sure you wipe off your steam wand and give it a little purge at the end
YOU1000000178_S0000072	i am going to give my espresso one more little swirl a really great thing to do after you have steamed your milk
YOU1000000178_S0000073	tap it
YOU1000000178_S0000075	on the counter
YOU1000000178_S0000076	and give it a nice swirl we call that polishing
YOU1000000178_S0000077	that is going to take what was a rougher texture and give it a nice shine so it has got that that white gold that cadillac milk
YOU1000000178_S0000078	and then you are going to combine the 2 with latte art
YOU1000000178_S0000079	there is a lot to be said about this and it takes some baristas a lifetime to learn really well
YOU1000000178_S0000080	so i am not going to try and describe it to you too much i am just going to show it to you and act like it is a mystical talent that only professionals can develop
YOU1000000178_S0000082	after years of practice
YOU1000000178_S0000084	and that right there is the finished cappuccino
YOU1000000178_S0000086	ugh
YOU1000000178_S0000088	
YOU1000000179_S0000001	we are going to explore the concept of charitable giving to see the ways in which you can help make an impact while also taking advantage of some of the financial and tax benefits
YOU1000000179_S0000003	charitable giving does not have to be complicated
YOU1000000179_S0000004	it can be as simple as making donations to your church alma mater or volunteering your time like helping out at the local mission
YOU1000000179_S0000005	giving is most fulfilling when you donate your money or time to a cause you are passionate about
YOU1000000179_S0000006	and studies have shown that when we give it triggers the same chemical reactions in our brains as falling in love or bonding with a newborn child
YOU1000000179_S0000007	besides the obvious emotional benefits you could also end up saving on taxes by giving
YOU1000000179_S0000009	now that you have your mission it is time to think about what goals you want to accomplish
YOU1000000179_S0000010	once you have some in mind put together an action plan on paper that is focused on the different steps you will take to create an impact
YOU1000000179_S0000012	some things you can include in your plan to help your giving have more of an impact would be to volunteer not just money but skills you may have
YOU1000000179_S0000013	it can also help to commit to a consistent donation over time and to focus on the less glamorous but essential needs the charity may have
YOU1000000179_S0000015	there are over 180 nonprofits in the united states so you will have a lot of choices
YOU1000000179_S0000016	make sure to evaluate the organizations that share your cause to make sure they have strong leadership procedures that will guide their operations and will benefit from your assistance
YOU1000000179_S0000018	giving can be more fun and more effective by connecting with others who share your goals
YOU1000000179_S0000019	getting family and friends involved helps to also reinforce shared values and create stronger connections
YOU1000000179_S0000020	besides benefiting the organizations of your choice your charitable giving can also impact your finances
YOU1000000179_S0000021	it is important to discuss your mission with your financial advisor to understand the role charitable giving can play in tax planning

YOU1000000180_S0000001	mister chief justice ladies and gentlemen we are gathered here today for a ceremony in which we will have sworn in the 1st head of a new agency i think we have here the best man for this new job that we could find
YOU1000000180_S0000003	and there was a necessity for the government at the time to show that it was serious about dealing with pollution problems
YOU1000000180_S0000004	that the federal government was willing to step in where obviously the almost total delegation of the states and local governments up prior to 1970 had not gotten the job done
YOU1000000180_S0000006	i came in mid 1973 was the oil embargo the arab oil embargo and energy was it
YOU1000000180_S0000007	and during my entire time it was the environmental energy
YOU1000000180_S0000009	conflict if you will in terms of policy within the administration in the congress that was pretty crucial and i think the major epa accomplishment of those years was to keep our programs on track
YOU1000000180_S0000011	in the area of health and safety you have to have regulation it is important that it be sensible and well managed the legislative job in terms of putting basic authority on the books is done what we now need is the science the information and the follow through
YOU1000000180_S0000012	if you will to get the job done
YOU1000000180_S0000014	the mission for which the agency was established is the protection of the health the welfare and the environment of the american people that is our priority it is a mission to which we are dedicated to which the president is dedicated
YOU1000000180_S0000016	the one that stands out to me was concluding the montreal protocol as a treaty that dealt with an extraordinarily significant environmental issue
YOU1000000180_S0000017	but also a treaty that i think established a framework for dealing with international environmental concerns
YOU1000000180_S0000019	the clean air act obviously has to stand very high on the list of things that i think we will be proud of and will stand the test of time it was a time when we
YOU1000000180_S0000021	dealt with very high expectations when we crafted a law a lot of the ideas had been in the agency were conceptually developed in the agency they were successfully integrated with the views of other agencies and coordinated very closely with the white house
YOU1000000180_S0000023	who better than your government to protect your air your water and your land it is something that every american should expect of its government that we would do these things
YOU1000000180_S0000024	for you setting tough standards setting standards that protect the people most at risk and then allowing for flexibility in how those standards are met which will allow us to build on the innovation and the creativity that exists in this country
YOU1000000180_S0000026	what we do the methods we discover the solutions we come up with will be prototypes for others
YOU1000000180_S0000027	we will look for ways to work with agriculture and business to find out how we can reach our shared goals of a clean environment in ways that will allow them to continue to supply us with what we need to enjoy our quality of life
YOU1000000180_S0000029	the job is never done we have to get even better at it
YOU1000000180_S0000030	and that has been made even more evident by the fact that we now live in a global economy where our country is competing with nations that are not nearly as environmentally conscious as we have become
YOU1000000180_S0000032	our country has made great strides in cleaning our air water and land in a way that allows our nation to continue to grow and prosper
YOU1000000180_S0000033	by expanding the roles of technology collaborative partnerships and flexible policies we will be able to engage broad interests and deliver results quicker and more effectively than ever before to provide the next generation
YOU1000000180_S0000034	a cleaner safer environment in which to live work and play
YOU1000000180_S0000036	we began by reaffirming the core values of this agency and its mission and we have shown the american people that devotion to science to transparency and the law are paramount in protecting human health and the environment
YOU1000000180_S0000038	while the world continues to change epa is mission continues to endure our mission is to protect public health and to safeguard the precious natural resources that we all need to survive and to thrive
YOU1000000180_S0000039	epa is here because the american people demanded it we will be here because they continue to demand it because we stand between pollution and our people
YOU1000000180_S0000041	those that we regulate ought to know what is expected of them
YOU1000000180_S0000043	so that they can plan and allocate resources to comply and the process that we engage in in adopting regulations is very very important because it sends a message it sends a message that we take seriously
YOU1000000180_S0000044	our role of taking comment and offering response and then making informed decisions on how it is going to impact those in the marketplace
YOU1000000180_S0000046	since the early 1970s epa is job has been pretty straightforward clean up america and the agency has done just that
YOU1000000180_S0000047	we can focus our attention and resources on helping communities help themselves
YOU1000000180_S0000048	doing this will strengthen this country from its foundation up
YOU1000000180_S0000049	and start to solve the environmental problems of tomorrow
YOU1000000180_S0000050	environmental protection is the forerunner the prerequisite for economic growth and job creation if we can solve this problem we can give many americans a much better future in the next 50 years
YOU1000000181_S0000001	i am living in a tai chi school in the wudang mountains which is the heart of taoism in china and my teacher is master gu who is a taoist tai chi master
YOU1000000181_S0000002	so sometimes in the afternoons we talk about daoism so hence this series
YOU1000000181_S0000003	daoism is an ancient chinese philosophy and religion dating back 2500 years to the writing of the daode qing by lao tzu
YOU1000000181_S0000005	you can think about it as the bible for taoism now the main thrust of taoism is to follow the tao or the path or way
YOU1000000181_S0000006	welcome to wudang mountain
YOU1000000181_S0000008	1000
YOU1000000181_S0000009	if you observe the chinese character 道 dao
YOU1000000181_S0000011	the 1st 3 strokes that is yin yao and yang yao that represents the yin yang balance
YOU1000000181_S0000012	then zi which means oneself
YOU1000000181_S0000014	that means dao is not far from you dao is within you
YOU1000000181_S0000015	the last part is zou zhi which means to go to move to act
YOU1000000181_S0000017	this is a pretty powerful idea we do not have to rely on an external god through our own actions we can find balance
YOU1000000181_S0000018	now the obvious question is great tell me what is this way but the tao does not refer to a thing instead it is the underlying order that governs the universe
YOU1000000181_S0000019	so defining it is a fruitless exercise what is instead is important is to be sensitive to how the universe works and then try and live in harmony with it
YOU1000000181_S0000020	that is what is meant by following the tao and taoist teachings have many guidelines on how to do so
YOU1000000181_S0000021	i have been reading the tao te poo which argues the children is character winnie the pooh is in fact a taoist
YOU1000000181_S0000022	it is a really fun way of getting into the taoist teachings and if you ever read winnie the pooh when you are younger check out the books again i did it recently it is a real nostalgia trip
YOU1000000181_S0000023	in it is a nice story that illustrates what it means to be a daoist
YOU1000000181_S0000024	around a large pot of vinegar crowd 3 men these are not any ordinary men in fact they are the 3 founders of the great asian philosophies
YOU1000000181_S0000025	confucius buddha and lao tzu
YOU1000000181_S0000026	each takes a taste of the vinegar and for confucius it was sour the world was full of degenerate people and corruption and the world was out of step with the way of heaven
YOU1000000181_S0000027	as a result the world was sour and what was needed was rules and rituals in order to retain order
YOU1000000181_S0000028	buddha then tasted the vinegar and he had a bitter expression for life was bitter because man is wants and desires led to mass suffering
YOU1000000181_S0000029	and happiness could only be found in leaving this world and entering nirvana
YOU1000000181_S0000030	for lao tzu however he had a smile on his face for a taoist bitterness and soundness only come from the unappreciative and inattentive mind
YOU1000000181_S0000031	i asked master gu how it could be possible lao tzu could keep on smiling when tasting this horrible vinegar
YOU1000000181_S0000032	human beings come from nature we must follow nature is path
YOU1000000181_S0000033	nature itself there is nothing about sour or bitter
YOU1000000181_S0000034	in nature the cosmos there is its own natural rhythm path
YOU1000000181_S0000035	never to be too fast not too slow there is you know he has his rhythm his pace we human beings also must find
YOU1000000181_S0000036	find it recognize it and follow this heavenly way
YOU1000000181_S0000037	so it only depends on you erwin
YOU1000000181_S0000039	attitude to life
YOU1000000181_S0000040	as the saying goes if you are frozen life is like a mirror you are frozen the mirror froze at you you smile the mirror smiles at you that is life
YOU1000000181_S0000041	a typical doll is never rich in their sense because they are mixed with the whole universe the whole universe is boundless
YOU1000000181_S0000042	so that is why they are very consented about life and wear a smile
YOU1000000181_S0000044	would not that be awesome to be able to keep on smiling when life sometimes turns sour
YOU1000000181_S0000045	and that is the prospect that taoist philosophy offers us it is a set of guidelines for living a contented and happy life
YOU1000000181_S0000046	as many of you will know i started this youtube channel after finishing university i found the time quite difficult i found my mood to be variable
YOU1000000181_S0000047	and my brain was just overactive so if you are like me and your brain is just a little bit too active or if you have had depression or anxiety or if you are like anyone and you just want to live a contented life
YOU1000000181_S0000048	then my role in these videos is to see how we can apply taoist philosophy to our own lives i do not want this to be me boring you each week i would love this to be a 2 way dialog
YOU1000000181_S0000049	where you guys tell me what you think about the concepts as well as if you have any questions or issues that are personally bothering you master gu and i can see if taoist philosophy can help you
YOU1000000181_S0000050	if you prefer to keep that private then of course you can message me on instagram or facebook but it would also be awesome to start a youtube discussion as well because then you guys can help each other out
YOU1000000181_S0000051	master gu embodies what it means to be a taoist he is a joyous man he laughs and smiles a lot
YOU1000000181_S0000052	i am not a selling cloth
YOU1000000181_S0000054	and despite being 50 plus he is full of energy
YOU1000000181_S0000058	so i am excited to be able to share with you some of the teachings that are in part responsible for these wonderful qualities
YOU1000000181_S0000060	and the 1st question for this week is what your knowledge or impressions of daoism is today do you guys know anything about it i am also starting from almost 0 so it is going to be a learning experience for both of us
YOU1000000181_S0000061	okay that is it guys thanks for watching
YOU1000000183_S0000000	one thing you are trying to say of all these public companies out there here is the company i really like the fundamentals are terrific their earnings are doing well their competitors are doing poorly
YOU1000000183_S0000001	i think this company is doing terrific and all of a sudden the stock might have gone from 40 to 30 because of this decline that would say wow here is a chance to buy it
YOU1000000183_S0000002	so you are trying to say some companies might have been overpriced at 60 and all they did was go to 50 and say big deal so you are trying to find companies you liked anyway right now you like them and now they have had a haircut
YOU1000000183_S0000003	that is what you would do not a stock that went from overpriced to fairly priced some of those fairly priced at the start of this exercise and then had a very you know a 5 for 4 sale
YOU1000000183_S0000005	hey guys welcome back to the channel in this video we are going to be talking about some investing lessons that we can learn from peter lynch
YOU1000000183_S0000006	that we can apply for our own investing in 2021
YOU1000000183_S0000007	so we are going to have a look at an interview from way back in 1997 a charlie rose interview that peter lynch did and i do have to say apologies
YOU1000000183_S0000008	some of the cuts in this interview are going to be quite abrupt it is because i do not understand like charlie rose he just interrupts peter all the time in this interview
YOU1000000183_S0000009	so i apologize i have tried to do the best i can to get to the meat of the argument because i think the whole interview is about 25 minutes so i have tried to chop it down into the best bits
YOU1000000183_S0000010	so with that said let us get stuck into it
YOU1000000183_S0000011	glad to be here
YOU1000000183_S0000012	explain to me what is going on
YOU1000000183_S0000013	well we had a huge run i mean the market was $4000 just you know 2.5 years ago and it ran up to $8300 in august
YOU1000000183_S0000014	and you know like any big rally sometimes it backs off i mean it is healthy
YOU1000000183_S0000015	everything is overpriced
YOU1000000183_S0000016	yeah and that does not help anything the market since world war ii has sold between 10 times earnings and 20 times earnings if you look at the dow jones or the s p 500 you add up all the companies and take the earnings
YOU1000000183_S0000017	you see there is a relationship and it follows mcdonald is earnings have been terrific the last 30 years and the stock has been terrific there is a direct relationship so the earnings of the s p 500 have been between this range of 10 and 20
YOU1000000183_S0000018	we were just about to go over the 20 which is the high end of the p range there was not a lot of
YOU1000000183_S0000019	so what do you want to use to is is it that the top of high high it should ever be
YOU1000000183_S0000020	right it has been over there only a few times ever over 20 and that is when usually inflation is about 0
YOU1000000183_S0000021	so this clip kind of just sets the scene because what peter lynch is describing in this clip is actually what we see today he is talking about how the p ratio of the market
YOU1000000183_S0000022	generally sits between 10 and 20 with 20 really being that upper end well now these days we have discovered what the ultra upper end of that number looks like
YOU1000000183_S0000023	and it seems to be
YOU1000000183_S0000025	about 30 now that is kind of scary because what we currently see is a pe ratio for the market at 35
YOU1000000183_S0000026	it is only been over 30 in 3 times in history 1929 1999 and right now
YOU1000000183_S0000027	so there is no question that the market is certainly hot just like the market was hot back when peter lynch did this interview
YOU1000000183_S0000028	back in 1997 but the question we have got to ask ourselves is well how do we go about our investing in this environment
YOU1000000183_S0000029	the decline yesterday in a sense it let off some of this overvaluation the market was even overvalued where it was and by letting it off then we got back to what was reasonable
YOU1000000183_S0000030	yeah i would say fairly priced maybe for the larger companies they are now okay there might be some small companies we have had 3000 companies come public the last 4 years that is 2 a business day
YOU1000000183_S0000031	some of those companies have gone down dramatically and that is sort of a research zone that average people in the stock shop that we can find some people know a lot about this 10000 public companies
YOU1000000183_S0000032	a lot of them are very attractive and no one is following them and there is lots of people following ibm
YOU1000000183_S0000034	companies that nobody else followed
YOU1000000183_S0000035	right i would like to go to see companies with unions or companies in trouble or companies that no one looks at
YOU1000000183_S0000036	that had night that is not
YOU1000000183_S0000037	yeah you have to look at a lot of them
YOU1000000183_S0000038	you know kennel is your wife or that is still out
YOU1000000183_S0000039	you have got pier one imports my wife found that one too but you have to look at 20 to find one it is just you do not go to the mall and find the stock i mean you have to say my god this sounds like it is good then you have to do some steps you have to do an organized method
YOU1000000183_S0000040	now that method we will get to in a 2nd but in this clip peter inadvertently describes exactly how we should be approaching our investing right now
YOU1000000183_S0000041	because today even though the market is really high we are in an environment where actually a lot of businesses are going down
YOU1000000183_S0000042	and what we see is that an index like the s p 500 is actually propped up
YOU1000000183_S0000043	by literally 5 to 10 really high performing massive behemoth companies
YOU1000000183_S0000044	now what peter is telling us in this clip is to be a great investor even when the market is really overvalued you have to get away from looking at just those massive behemoth companies
YOU1000000183_S0000045	everybody is following these big companies everyone is investing in them and the prices for these big companies are all sky high
YOU1000000183_S0000046	so we should be broadening our horizons and looking maybe at the companies that come after the 50th largest stock in the s p 500
YOU1000000183_S0000047	or maybe beyond the 20th largest stock in the asx 200 because that is where you are more likely going to find value
YOU1000000183_S0000048	and then the other secret is that of course you just have to keep looking at a lot of businesses
YOU1000000183_S0000049	the best investors are the ones that turn over the most stones right as peter lynch said in this interview you have to look at 20 to find one
YOU1000000183_S0000050	alright with that said now let us have a look at the actual steps that we should all be taking to go ahead and make an investment in this sort of environment
YOU1000000183_S0000051	then you have to do some steps you have to do an organized method people are careful when they buy a toaster
YOU1000000183_S0000053	careful they are careful they do they do some research
YOU1000000183_S0000054	but they do not do it with stock they call up the broker they see somebody at lunch and they say man i got this hot stock and you run right out and you spend $5000 small investors
YOU1000000183_S0000055	yeah even worse they put an option in the international data wacc they do not even own international data wacc they have a 90 day claim
YOU1000000183_S0000056	but it was a good in the make a lot of my yet
YOU1000000183_S0000057	and it is like a casino so it is like a casino you get the same results except there is more paperwork
YOU1000000183_S0000058	so this morning you get up and you go in and you look at at those companies that that you
YOU1000000183_S0000059	that you know something about you have to have an itch let us say the cement industry goes from crummy to semi crummy to fairly good the stocks are going north
YOU1000000183_S0000060	you are going to make money that is the industry you know what if you know the publishing industry you have an edge you work i mean what if you last 30 years
YOU1000000183_S0000061	you work in the restaurant industry you would have seen taco bell you would have seen sambarro is you would have seen pizza hut you would have seen chili is you would have seen these companies doing very well you should have bought those instead of trying to buy biotechnology stocks you know nothing about
YOU1000000183_S0000062	i mean i know nothing about local area networking a lot of people are buying the cisco they are buying the equipment saying we are going to root together all these peripherals and put together the servers
YOU1000000183_S0000063	but but that is not a bad by the way on a huge percentage of their market
YOU1000000183_S0000064	you know what that was their saying only a few people had that my god if it works for us other people will try it then colleges will try it high schools will try it then they will go overseas they knew they were early in the ballgame
YOU1000000183_S0000065	and they should have been buying that company instead of out buying something they do not know anything about some oil drilling company i mean people have this tendency to always buy something they do not
YOU1000000183_S0000066	all you need is a few good stocks
YOU1000000183_S0000067	this is your song this has been your song for a long time only by what you know
YOU1000000183_S0000068	no but people wake up in the morning and say there is 5000 companies out there which one should i buy the average person ought to be able to follow 4 or 5 companies they ought to be able to lecture on them they understand the companies
YOU1000000183_S0000069	and this forces you this tool says to you right down the .
YOU1000000183_S0000070	all right but you keep saying this
YOU1000000183_S0000071	so that makes sense you have to start with obviously going ahead and doing some research you know he says people do a lot of research when they go to buy a toaster
YOU1000000183_S0000072	why is not it that people do a lot of research when they go to buy a stock do not treat the stock market like a casino
YOU1000000183_S0000073	and then when you actually do sit down to learn about some companies look at the companies that are really relevant to you
YOU1000000183_S0000074	warren buffett would use the phrase stick within your circle of competence peter lynch is example here is you know if you are someone that works in the restaurant industry
YOU1000000183_S0000075	look at pizza hut look at taco bell they are companies that you probably already understand to quite a high level
YOU1000000183_S0000076	and do not go messing around with these biotechnology companies that nobody understands so once you find those companies that resonate with you then you go in you do that research
YOU1000000183_S0000077	and as peter lynch says you only need 4 to 5 good stocks in like a decade warren buffett would argue you need even less than that
YOU1000000183_S0000078	but you should know those companies well enough to be able to give a lecture on their business
YOU1000000183_S0000079	so that is really the 1st step 1st step is to stay within your kind of circle of competence 2nd step go in and understand those businesses in depth
YOU1000000183_S0000080	and then after that what happens next well let us listen in
YOU1000000183_S0000081	one thing you try to do is say of all these public companies out there here is a company i really like the fundamentals are terrific their earnings are doing well their competitors are doing poorly
YOU1000000183_S0000082	i think this company is doing terrific and all of a sudden the stock might have gone from 40 to 30 because of this decline that would say wow here is a chance to buy it
YOU1000000183_S0000083	so you are trying to say some companies might have been overpriced at 60 and all they did was go to 50 and say big deal so you are trying to find companies you liked anyway
YOU1000000183_S0000084	right now you like them and now they have had a haircut that is what you would do not a slight one from overpriced to fairly priced send it to a fairly priced at the start of this exercise
YOU1000000183_S0000085	and then had a very you know a 5 for 4 sale
YOU1000000183_S0000086	if you had been managing the magellan fund this morning you would have been buying like crazy
YOU1000000183_S0000087	i would have been researching like crazy i would have been saying which companies are the same story is there anything really happening this is a non event for them they are still doing well even if we have a recession
YOU1000000183_S0000088	is nothing to do with them and that is the kind of kinds i am trying to buy but let us say if a company just think of this as being you say to yourself i think this company is going to earn something in the future
YOU1000000183_S0000089	it is already discounted at the time a huge multiple you say it is already has to work and that is only mislead
YOU1000000183_S0000090	so you have to say to yourself if i am right how much am i going to make if i am wrong how much am i going to lose that is the risk reward ratio in stock shop we talk about if i am right i hope i am going to double trip my money if i am wrong
YOU1000000183_S0000091	may all lose 30 40% that is a favor ratio we say if i am right the stock is not going to go up it is already discounting terrific things if discounting terrific things are already in the stock i do not want to own it
YOU1000000183_S0000092	so 1st step is to find a company where you have got the edge the 2nd step is to really understand the business understand the financials understand the fundamentals
YOU1000000183_S0000093	but then what peter lynch talks about in this environment where basically everything is overvalued what you want to do is you want to try and find companies that are just fairly valued
YOU1000000183_S0000094	even in this extreme overvalued environment because as investors what we do is we buy undervalued stocks right we always buy at a discount to intrinsic value
YOU1000000183_S0000095	and that is how we know we make money in the long run now if you find a company that is really great but it is also really expensive in this environment
YOU1000000183_S0000096	and then there is some sort of 10 15% market dip and it brings the stock back down to fair value well then remember it is still like paying
YOU1000000183_S0000097	full retail for that stock so what we are looking for is great businesses that in this overvalued environment are just fairly value
YOU1000000183_S0000098	so if anything does happen suddenly in the market something causes a 10% dip or a 15% dip then all of a sudden that business goes from being a fair value
YOU1000000183_S0000099	to now being undervalued so they are the kind of situations we are looking for imagine this the new xbox one x console full retail
YOU1000000183_S0000100	price i think is 750 australian dollars if you went into say
YOU1000000183_S0000102	eb games and they were selling that xbox for you know it was $1000 and now it is dropped down to $750
YOU1000000183_S0000103	you are not getting excited by that deal because it is just come back down to full price but if that same store was offering you know it started at $750 full retail
YOU1000000183_S0000104	and then it dropped down to 500 well obviously that is a much better deal exactly the same thing with businesses in the stock market
YOU1000000183_S0000105	and just quickly the other thing to note from what peter lynch said in this little clip was when he said if a stock is trading at a huge multiple it basically has to work
YOU1000000183_S0000106	right and if it does work out then you are still just even now even today what we are seeing is some companies they might be great companies but they are trading at p ratios in the 100s
YOU1000000183_S0000107	if not literally the 1000s like some companies for instance like tesla i think has a p ratio of 1300
YOU1000000183_S0000108	now what this means is it means that the price that investors are paying today this is already they are expecting flawless continued growth
YOU1000000183_S0000109	for years and years and years to come that is what the share price is telling us now if you invest in a company like this at these prices
YOU1000000183_S0000110	then there is very little room for upside and there is a whole lot of room for downside because investors right now are already expecting years and years and years of perfection
YOU1000000183_S0000111	right of absolutely perfect execution as peter lynch says you have to factor in if i am right how much am i going to make
YOU1000000183_S0000112	and if i am wrong how much am i going to lose and that is a very important couple of questions to ask yourself before buying into a stock
YOU1000000183_S0000113	and that is where you go back to your discounted cashflow analysis and you look at the growth rates to figure out what that risk ratio is for the company that you are looking at
YOU1000000183_S0000114	what you are saying to people today about the future of the market over the near term is what what is your feeling
YOU1000000183_S0000115	we can take a look by business we can take a coin out and flip it i have no idea what the next 1000 points
YOU1000000183_S0000116	the next 6000 points can be up the next 14000 points can be up the next 20000 points can be up
YOU1000000183_S0000117	but you do not know what the next 1000 is going to be
YOU1000000183_S0000118	nobody has to be a nobody does
YOU1000000183_S0000119	and it is futile to try and guess it corporate profits will be a lot higher 10 years from now it will be a lot higher 20 years from now that is what you can rely on
YOU1000000183_S0000120	the 3rd key step that peter lynch highlights in this clip is to always focus on the long term
YOU1000000183_S0000121	do not be worried about what the market will do next week next month or even next year what you should be really focused on is what is this company going to look like in 5 years from now
YOU1000000183_S0000122	in 10 years from now always focus on the long term because if you can do that then short term market fluctuations they really do not matter
YOU1000000183_S0000123	and you just do not stress about them at all in fact when prices go down you get excited you do not get scared
YOU1000000183_S0000124	as peter lynch says you know corporate profits will be a lot higher in 10 years from now they will be a lot higher in 20 years from now and that is what you have to rely on
YOU1000000183_S0000125	we rely on the fact that yes businesses are going to continually improve maybe not over the next year or 2 maybe there is something like what we saw with the lockdown where businesses impaired for like a whole year or 2
YOU1000000183_S0000126	it still does not matter to us because we look for situations where what is going to happen over 5 years what is going to happen over 10 years
YOU1000000183_S0000127	and if that situation is favorable that is when we invest
YOU1000000183_S0000128	what about all the criticism of derivatives and the impact they have had
YOU1000000183_S0000129	that is a little complicated for me
YOU1000000183_S0000130	all i know is i mean i do not know about this it is complicated for you it is way over my head i have never bought an option in my life i never bought a time is on your side when you own a stock you know i do not know about putting you know 3% down and buying a future in a strap and a straddle that is way over my head
YOU1000000183_S0000132	all right so you are optimistic about the future of the american economy earnings potential for most well run companies will do all right
YOU1000000183_S0000133	but people have to understand we have had 9 recessions since world war ii
YOU1000000183_S0000134	we will have other recessions
YOU1000000183_S0000135	not in one nail
YOU1000000183_S0000136	but we may have one in the future and do not get worried about it we will have one sometime it will happen and no one will tell you when it is going to happen
YOU1000000183_S0000137	well will not the fundamentals tell you
YOU1000000183_S0000138	no you will find out after the fact all of a sudden you will notice orders slowing prices get more competitive then earnings are down usually you find out after the fact everybody has been saying we are going to have a recession for 5 years it just has not happened
YOU1000000183_S0000139	it is great to see you i hope you will come back anytime peter
YOU1000000183_S0000140	you know i really like this last clip from peter lynch it is just a lesson you do not have to get too fancy right you do not have to drift into things that you do not understand like a lot of stock investors
YOU1000000183_S0000141	they are just all over options peter lynch is the 1st to put his hand up and says look i love investing in companies i do not have a clue what is going on when it comes to options never bought an option in my life
YOU1000000183_S0000142	so you know step one find the businesses you understand
YOU1000000183_S0000143	step 2 you know make sure that you can make sure you are looking at fairly valued businesses that can go undervalued
YOU1000000183_S0000144	step 3 focus on the long run find solid businesses with low debts high cash flows and just keep focused on that stuff because that is the winning formula you know
YOU1000000183_S0000145	we are going to see recessions in the future we have seen recessions in the past it could happen tomorrow it could happen next week it could happen in a year is time or 5 years from now
YOU1000000183_S0000146	but the main thing is that strong companies with solid cash flows that you understand that you are going to hold for a long period of time
YOU1000000183_S0000147	they are the ones that are going to make it through and they are the ones we should be ultra focused on in any stock market environment so
YOU1000000183_S0000148	anyway guys i hope that you enjoyed this video i always like listening to what peter lynch has to say even in these really really old interviews like this from 1997 and yet
YOU1000000183_S0000150	just because market was high then market is high now everything that he is saying is almost directly applicable into what we are doing with our investing today
YOU1000000183_S0000151	and i love it i love it when we can draw those kind of parallels it is like poetry
YOU1000000183_S0000153	anyway guys hope you enjoyed the video
YOU1000000183_S0000154	leave a like on it if you did subscribe to the channel if you have not done so already

YOU1000000183_S0000156	you know a lot of key points in peter lynch is strategy in much more detail and kind of like step by step
YOU1000000183_S0000157	then feel free to check out introduction to stock analysis but that will do me for today guys thank you guys very much for watching and i will see you all in the next video
YOU1000000184_S0000001	i am bob klein from los angeles i wonder if you could give us a glimpse into your investment process the way you approach looking at a particular industry and i wonder if you could use real estate as an example
YOU1000000184_S0000002	i know real estate has not been a big huge part of berkshire is portfolio over the years and i wonder if that is because you view real estate as a commodity business
YOU1000000184_S0000003	or maybe the cash flows from real estate tend to be more predictable than perhaps from some other industries
YOU1000000184_S0000005	it tends to be less likely to be mispriced and therefore less likely to find terrific bargains in real estate
YOU1000000184_S0000006	so
YOU1000000184_S0000007	go ahead
YOU1000000184_S0000008	so just wondering if we could if we were watching a discussion between you and charlie hashing out the merits of real estate how would we go
YOU1000000184_S0000009	well it would go like all our other conversations he would say no for about 15 minutes
YOU1000000184_S0000011	and i would gauge by the degree to which he the emotion he put into his nose whether he really liked the deal or not
YOU1000000184_S0000013	yeah
YOU1000000184_S0000015	we both had a fair amount of experience in real estate and charlie made his early money in real estate
YOU1000000184_S0000016	the 2nd point is the more important point real estate is not a commodity
YOU1000000184_S0000018	i think it tends to be more accurately priced
YOU1000000184_S0000019	pretty developed real estate more accurately priced most of the time
YOU1000000184_S0000020	during the rtc period when you had huge amounts of transactions and you had an owner that did not want to be an owner in a very big way and they did not know what the hell they owned and all of that sort of thing
YOU1000000184_S0000021	i mean you had a lot of mispricing then
YOU1000000184_S0000023	under
YOU1000000184_S0000025	most conditions it is hard to find real estate that is really mispriced i mean when i look at the transactions that reits engage in currently and you get a lot of information on that sort of thing
YOU1000000184_S0000026	you know they are very summer
YOU1000000184_S0000028	but it is a competitive world and .
YOU1000000184_S0000029	and you know they all know about what a class a office building in chicago or wherever it may be is going to produce at least they have they may all be wrong as it turns out because of some unusual events
YOU1000000184_S0000030	but it is hard to argue with the current conventional wisdom most of the time in the real estate world
YOU1000000184_S0000031	but occasionally there could be big opportunities in the field but if they exist
YOU1000000184_S0000033	it will certainly be because there is probably going to be a lot of chaos in real estate financing for one reason or another we have done some real estate financing
YOU1000000184_S0000035	you have to have the money shut off
YOU1000000184_S0000037	to quite a degree probably to get any big mispricing across the board charlie
YOU1000000184_S0000039	yeah we do not have any
YOU1000000184_S0000041	competitive advantage over experienced real estate investors in the field
YOU1000000184_S0000043	and we would not have if we were operating with our own money as a partnership
YOU1000000184_S0000045	and if you operate as a corporation such as ours which is taxable under
YOU1000000184_S0000047	chapter c of the internal revenue code you have got a whole layer of corporate taxes
YOU1000000184_S0000048	between the real estate income and the use of the income by the people who own the real estate
YOU1000000184_S0000050	by its nature real estate tends to be a very lousy investment for people who are taxed under subchapter c of the code relating to corporations so the combination of having a
YOU1000000184_S0000052	generally allows the activity for people with our tax structure and having no special competence in the field
YOU1000000184_S0000053	means that we spend almost no time thinking about anything in real estate and then such real estate as we have actually
YOU1000000184_S0000055	done like holding surplus
YOU1000000184_S0000057	i would say we have a poor record at it
YOU1000000184_S0000059	c corps really does not make any sense i mean i know there are c corps around that are in real estate but there are other structures that are more attractive there really are not other structures
YOU1000000184_S0000060	i mean lloyd is is an attempt at it to some degree but there are other structures that work well for big insurance companies i mean you can not have a walmart very well that does not exist in a c corp
YOU1000000184_S0000061	so they are not subject to s corp or partnership competition that determines the returns on capital in the discount store field
YOU1000000184_S0000062	but if you are competing with the equivalent of s corps
YOU1000000184_S0000064	or partnerships or individuals
YOU1000000184_S0000065	you have just got an economic disadvantage as a c corp which is for those of you who do not love reading the internal revenue code
YOU1000000184_S0000067	corporation that you think of all of the dow jones companies all of the s p companies and so on
YOU1000000184_S0000069	and the
YOU1000000184_S0000071	as charlie says it is unlikely that the disadvantage of our structure combined with the competitive nature of people with better structures buying those kinds of assets will ever lead to anything
YOU1000000184_S0000072	really interesting although i would say that we missed the boat to some extent during the rtc days
YOU1000000184_S0000074	it was a sufficiently inefficient market at that time and there was a lack of financing that we could have made a lot of money if we had been geared up for it at that time
YOU1000000184_S0000075	we actually had a few transactions that were pretty interesting but nothing that was significant in relation to our total capital
YOU1000000184_S0000076	we thought significantly about buying the irvine corporation when it became available
YOU1000000184_S0000078	but that is the only big one i can remember that we seriously thought about
YOU1000000184_S0000080	yeah that was in 1977
YOU1000000184_S0000082	yeah mobil oil was interested and don brennan ended up putting together a group for it
YOU1000000184_S0000084	could conceivably happen but it is unlikely
YOU1000000185_S0000001	hello everyone and welcome to a very special edition of the us chamber foundation is path forward series
YOU1000000185_S0000002	if you have been a regular viewer welcome back if you are new to the series thank you for joining us we hope you find it both informative and interesting
YOU1000000185_S0000003	and boy did you pick a great week to tune in over the past few months we have been bringing together experts in a number of critical fields
YOU1000000185_S0000004	all around the topic of returning to work today we are thrilled to be joined by 2 of the most impactful philanthropists in the world
YOU1000000185_S0000005	bill and melinda gates have dedicated their lives to advancing science and improving public health among other initiatives
YOU1000000185_S0000006	the us chamber foundation has a deep relationship with the gates foundation
YOU1000000185_S0000007	for more than a decade we have worked together on both k 12 and post secondary education reforms
YOU1000000185_S0000008	we value their partnership and we are very pleased to have bill and melinda gates with us here today
YOU1000000185_S0000009	as you have likely seen a few years ago bill brought attention to the risks of a deadly global pandemic sadly his warning is now our reality
YOU1000000185_S0000010	the good news is that he and melinda have committed themselves and their organization to finding a solution and that gives us all a sense of hope
YOU1000000185_S0000011	the bill and melinda gates foundation has committed more than $30 to the global covid 19 response
YOU1000000185_S0000012	we are so grateful for their leadership during this trying moment and excited to talk to them today
YOU1000000185_S0000013	this episode was pre recorded to fit their busy schedules so there will not be audience questions at the end this time but there is a lot that we get to talk about and so let us get to it
YOU1000000185_S0000015	well thank you very much for being with us we have so many questions we will just want to jump right in and so let me ask you both
YOU1000000185_S0000016	what is the gates foundation doing to fight the coronavirus and why is it such a priority for you
YOU1000000185_S0000018	our foundation has a
YOU1000000185_S0000020	big focus on infectious diseases that kill 10s of people primarily in developing countries
YOU1000000185_S0000021	and so you know our understanding about how you design a vaccine we funded lots of new vaccines
YOU1000000185_S0000022	we are a partner in gavi which actually buys vaccines for developing countries and we have a lot of the expertise that is not in the private sector to pick
YOU1000000185_S0000023	which of these we should build factories for and how we coordinate all this activity and so it is become a huge focus for us
YOU1000000185_S0000024	and of course the benefit of getting the vaccine you know even 3 or 4 months earlier will be very dramatic in terms of ending these
YOU1000000185_S0000025	awful economic effects as well as the death and disease
YOU1000000185_S0000027	melinda when do you think we will see a vaccine at scale and a 2 part question
YOU1000000185_S0000028	you have also talked beautifully about the need to have an equitable distribution of a vaccine so when do you see this at scale and what can we do to make distribution equitable
YOU1000000185_S0000029	yes so i think we all believe that just seeing the various vaccine candidates that are coming through the pipeline there are 3 that are looking quite promising luckily
YOU1000000185_S0000030	and i think we all believe that by 2021 we will have a vaccine
YOU1000000185_S0000031	we are working ahead of time with the manufacturers with the pharmaceutical companies to try and actually have manufacturing capability ready to go
YOU1000000185_S0000032	so as soon as those trials are finished the vaccine can go immediately into the manufacturing
YOU1000000185_S0000033	and the whole reason we got involved in this vaccine was to make sure there is equitable distribution
YOU1000000185_S0000034	the last thing you want is a bidding war between countries for this vaccine we know there are 60 health care workers around the world
YOU1000000185_S0000035	who are keeping everybody safe they deserve to get this vaccine 1st and from there you want to do tiering in various countries
YOU1000000185_S0000036	to make sure your most vulnerable populations get it in our country that would be blacks and native americans people with underlying health conditions and the elderly
YOU1000000185_S0000037	and so we need to look at as a globe and we are involved with many european leaders and african leaders and others in southeast asia to make sure
YOU1000000185_S0000038	there is a purchasing fund that can pull that vaccine through when it is available and get it out in wide scale distribution
YOU1000000185_S0000040	gosh i have so many follow up questions i will try to stay focused so let me go back to bill for a 2nd you got widespread attention for prediction you made in 2015
YOU1000000185_S0000041	about the dangers of a global pandemic and you sadly for the world did predict the future and so let me ask you to do it again what are you concerned about now
YOU1000000185_S0000043	well this will not be the last pandemic that we face pandemics can come from natural causes
YOU1000000185_S0000044	which is largely coming across from other species a flu for example is still a very big risk
YOU1000000185_S0000045	and so we will have to invest
YOU1000000185_S0000047	in making sure that we catch the disease sooner and that we have platforms to make diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines very quickly
YOU1000000185_S0000048	very little was invested even though there were these calls by a lot of people including our foundation
YOU1000000185_S0000049	one group that was funded the coalition for epidemic preparedness and innovation cepi
YOU1000000185_S0000050	we welcome trust norway uk japan were the initial funders and that is helping out here
YOU1000000185_S0000051	so we are better off than if that had not happened but you know people trust government to think through
YOU1000000185_S0000052	these eventual bad things this was a failure to get ready
YOU1000000185_S0000053	and the cost would have been tiny compared to say what we spend on being ready for war we did not actually do the simulation to think about
YOU1000000185_S0000054	okay what about nursing homes what about getting factories ready what about the testing regime
YOU1000000185_S0000055	you know in fact the testing could have been ramped up very quickly in a few countries that have almost avoided the epidemic entirely like
YOU1000000185_S0000057	taiwan new zealand australia you know they took their experience and actually prepared and so they moved a lot faster
YOU1000000185_S0000058	so we
YOU1000000185_S0000060	you know we will have to prepare for the next one
YOU1000000185_S0000062	i would say is will get attention this time
YOU1000000185_S0000064	so you know that reminds me of going back to the vaccine melinda and i promised to move off of it but you know we have never had a vaccine for coronavirus
YOU1000000185_S0000065	and that makes people nervous about this time so i think the audience will be so pleased to hear your optimism for this right
YOU1000000185_S0000066	what do you think is different this time that makes us think the development will happen is it this global coordination
YOU1000000185_S0000067	it is the pharmaceutical companies working together with scientists from all over the globe in a very coordinated fashion
YOU1000000185_S0000068	we have never seen the companies come together in this way and also to be thinking ahead about manufacturing
YOU1000000185_S0000069	and manufacturing not just for their own country or their own region but for other places in the world and so that is what makes us optimistic is the many many conversations that we are having
YOU1000000185_S0000070	the way we are seeing the scientists move forward with the data as soon as they get it and also seeing global leaders come together
YOU1000000185_S0000071	like the european commission did a huge pledging event for this vaccine alliance that we have been part of and seeing money come together to say
YOU1000000185_S0000072	we need this so that it is ready when the vaccine is ready to go we can actually purchase that vaccine for the rest of the world
YOU1000000185_S0000074	and do you think bill the same thing is true on therapeutics and testing i mean do you think that the way that things are coming together will get us where we need to be
YOU1000000185_S0000075	on the other sides of the equation as well
YOU1000000185_S0000077	well people are caught a little bit flat footed in that usually the us is very well organized
YOU1000000185_S0000078	this new drug that got proven out that is a trial network we funded with others with wellcome trust in the uk
YOU1000000185_S0000079	you know usually you expect the us to do good coordinated trials and you know to pick drugs for their scientific merit
YOU1000000185_S0000080	the world has had a little bit of a hard time when the us testing thing went in the wrong direction
YOU1000000185_S0000081	when it has not been a federal notion of how you prioritize things but i have to say the europeans are filling that vacuum particularly in terms of caring
YOU1000000185_S0000082	for the entire world their generosity has been quite good people hope that the us comes back
YOU1000000185_S0000083	although you know withdrawing from who is a step in the opposite direction but historically the us you know we did smallpox eradication
YOU1000000185_S0000084	rotary has been behind the polio progress that we have made which is done through who
YOU1000000185_S0000085	and a substantial part of the us money that goes there is for that polio eradication and so there is still a chance for the us
YOU1000000185_S0000086	to contribute on this and not just thinking of itself but also in the same way we did
YOU1000000185_S0000087	and particularly president bush and pepfar did helping out the entire world
YOU1000000185_S0000089	you know you have both been really vocal about the need to make this a global response and to help people outside of our borders
YOU1000000185_S0000090	if you were talking to in this audience a small business person in the middle of the country somewhere who might not understand that
YOU1000000185_S0000091	explain why you think it is so important that we reach beyond our borders and help control this virus
YOU1000000185_S0000092	well i think you know covid anywhere is covid everywhere and so for a small business owner
YOU1000000185_S0000093	you know the supplies that come in that help you run your business do not all necessarily come from the united states
YOU1000000185_S0000095	and your customers probably are not all just us customers and so if we want to have global trade and a global supply chain
YOU1000000185_S0000096	in global manufacturing we have to get the whole world coordinated in its response to this disease because it is not going to be able to be contained
YOU1000000185_S0000097	in one or 2 places even once we have gotten it outside of the us borders
YOU1000000185_S0000098	and to put it in perspective the us has spent 10s of dollars to try and deal with the problem here we are only talking about less than a few percent
YOU1000000185_S0000099	that of that that would need to be spent on helping get rid of the disease in the entire world
YOU1000000185_S0000100	so it is not like there is some gigantic trade off these are very small dollars just like the who is $50 a year
YOU1000000185_S0000101	you know for things like reproductive health vaccines polio covers a lot of different areas
YOU1000000185_S0000102	and so it is not competing budget wise with the large scale resources
YOU1000000185_S0000104	you know your foundation does amazing work we have been lucky to be partners for a long time on some k through 12 education work
YOU1000000185_S0000105	we are very grateful to receive that support and amplify that good work and it makes me wonder about how the world is changing in a broader sense
YOU1000000185_S0000106	as a result of this virus i mean what do you i mean melinda let me go to you 1st what do you think we are going to see in terms of some lasting changes
YOU1000000185_S0000107	as a result of this health and economic crisis
YOU1000000185_S0000108	well i think that is yet to come and i think you know it is up to us as citizens to rebuild the world that we want
YOU1000000185_S0000109	i think this crisis has exposed some of the gaps around the world but particularly in the united states
YOU1000000185_S0000110	and one of those in particular are the gender and the racial inequities that exist
YOU1000000185_S0000111	in terms of gender we know that women do 2.5 times more work at home than men do and that is the unpaid labor of
YOU1000000185_S0000112	caring for the kids making the lunch making sure they are online learning right now
YOU1000000185_S0000113	and so you know it will expose for us that is just way past time that the us has a paid family medical leave policy we are the only industrialized nation that does not
YOU1000000185_S0000114	and if we want to put people back to work safely and keep their families safe from getting sick we need to have paid family medical leave
YOU1000000185_S0000115	and so i think congress in its wisdom and 2 of the stimulus bills started to address that we need a long term solution
YOU1000000185_S0000116	the other thing i would say is not only has covid exposed the gaps in the system it is also showed us opportunities like the fact that kids could jump online
YOU1000000185_S0000117	and start learning now unfortunately it is not all kids because many kids did not have access to a computer or good digital literacy online
YOU1000000185_S0000118	or teachers who knew how to teach online but we know now it is possible and so i think now we will make sure that technology gets spread equitably
YOU1000000185_S0000119	and those great lesson plans and advising that can happen i think one last example i will give on digital in the developing world
YOU1000000185_S0000120	there are many many people who have phones and do digital banking on their phone they have access to money on their phone mobile money that was at scale in a number of countries
YOU1000000185_S0000121	but all of a sudden people really said 0 my gosh do not have to stand in line for my government payment where i might get sick
YOU1000000185_S0000122	so just to take pakistan alone in 48 hours 40 additional people signed up for digital bank account that is an opportunity we can use
YOU1000000185_S0000123	and particularly used to reach low income families and women on that phone with all kinds of things like cash transfers
YOU1000000185_S0000124	more information more information about when health services are available so
YOU1000000185_S0000125	those some of those digital opportunities are really hitting in ways we did not expect as quickly as we had been had thought they would
YOU1000000185_S0000127	i love that answer because i think there is a lot we are afraid of right now both in terms of health and the economy and how to right this social injustice ship
YOU1000000185_S0000128	and there is a lot we are afraid of and it is nice to think about some optimistic outcomes for this too so the other day in an interview david rubenstein asked me
YOU1000000185_S0000129	what i had learned about working remotely and i admitted to him that i was conducting a lot of interviews without shoes on
YOU1000000185_S0000130	i am pleading the 5th about my shoeless state at the moment but what have you learned about yourselves in this time and what has changed about the way that you are working
YOU1000000185_S0000132	well it is impressive that for office work it
YOU1000000185_S0000134	you know partly built in on the relationships that you built up overtime you can actually do quite well in our foundation has an
YOU1000000185_S0000136	nobody has been in the office for over 3 months now and yet our work is going on pretty much full speed
YOU1000000185_S0000137	and you know because i am involved with software i think ok we can make these software platforms even better
YOU1000000185_S0000138	make it easy to take notes or share things or have side conversations
YOU1000000185_S0000139	but it has been decent enough to allow a lot to happen and it is certainly going to accelerate the idea of do we need to travel as much
YOU1000000185_S0000141	you know how good can we make online education how good can we make telemedicine
YOU1000000185_S0000142	it is like 10 years of
YOU1000000185_S0000144	progress on those things will get compressed down into just a couple of years
YOU1000000185_S0000146	yeah
YOU1000000185_S0000147	i would say our lives like everybody around the united states have changed substantially we are incredibly fortunate not to be struggling to put a meal on the table we just are lucky
YOU1000000185_S0000148	but yes our work lives you know working from home was not something we did as much before we are certainly using a lot of microsoft teams and zoom and other things
YOU1000000185_S0000149	like you suzanne i have changed i have claimed that when i go back to work i will not be wearing heels i am going to wear my tennis shoes because i wear them all the time now
YOU1000000185_S0000150	for every single meeting including right now and the other thing i would say is i am not going to travel as much
YOU1000000185_S0000151	i think there will absolutely be meetings i travel for and i still think there will be absolutely reasons to go to africa and southeast asia
YOU1000000185_S0000152	but i think conferences can be changed and we are seeing many many people do them online now and so i do think i will travel less which i think will give me more time to just enjoy life
YOU1000000185_S0000153	and take the breaks that i take here in seattle between my zoom meetings to step outside a little bit more
YOU1000000185_S0000154	well i do not know that the world can take you guys taking too much time off i think we need your hard work and big hearts for the problems that we are facing
YOU1000000185_S0000155	and you are really kind to have spent this time with us this evening so thank you both very very much
YOU1000000185_S0000156	thanks suzanne thanks for having us
YOU1000000186_S0000002	it is very very rare and this program has been around for a long time to get in my opinion 2 of the really greatest human beings that we have living on this planet
YOU1000000186_S0000003	today and both together they have never been together before although i have had them individually
YOU1000000186_S0000004	and they have so much in common
YOU1000000186_S0000005	bill gates and aamir khan what do they have in common
YOU1000000186_S0000006	they are 2 of the world is greatest school and college dropouts number one
YOU1000000186_S0000008	so if you are going to drop out do not worry
YOU1000000186_S0000010	this is your future
YOU1000000186_S0000011	they are also in a way moving on to phase 2 of their lives a new chapter
YOU1000000186_S0000013	i can give you a little anecdote when about 2 years ago or maybe a little more than that when bill gates was in his phase one of his life
YOU1000000186_S0000014	and we were talking to a whole lot of software people rather than more interesting people like you
YOU1000000186_S0000015	i asked him to give a sound check say one 2 3 4
YOU1000000186_S0000016	and he said 60
YOU1000000186_S0000018	he was counting notes then now he is counting people being saved by vaccination by vaccines in terms of 10s and 10s of them
YOU1000000186_S0000019	it is a huge terrific change in your life phase 2
YOU1000000186_S0000020	and amit in a way you have also moved from of course you have not given up your earlier acting career
YOU1000000186_S0000021	but you have also moved on to social issues with this most path breaking television program which had a huge impact
YOU1000000186_S0000022	and everybody said you are nuts why are you doing this sort of stuff why do not you stick to movies so what motivated what caused that change
YOU1000000186_S0000023	you know i do not know i think it is
YOU1000000186_S0000025	you know i was at a discussion sometime back and one of the questions asked to my team
YOU1000000186_S0000027	what are the .
YOU1000000186_S0000029	what are the good qualities that a good ngo should have those questions asked to
YOU1000000186_S0000031	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000032	he said that one of the good qualities any ngo should have or any person who wants to be part of social service should have is that
YOU1000000186_S0000034	it is not just the emotion of wanting to do something for somebody else which is in itself a good emotion that you want to do something for someone
YOU1000000186_S0000035	but if you feel that your life is incomplete if you do not
YOU1000000186_S0000036	right
YOU1000000186_S0000037	so you are doing it for yourself really
YOU1000000186_S0000038	right
YOU1000000186_S0000039	of course you are doing it for someone else and i think that is what is important and it is something that happens to you if you feel like it does not have to happen to you
YOU1000000186_S0000040	but i think in me what grew was that this feeling that i needed to for myself do something where i felt better about myself when i felt i was you know i feel i am so privileged in so many ways
YOU1000000186_S0000041	and i feel that i really feel that when i see around me people who are not as privileged i can not just sit by and be comfortable with that
YOU1000000186_S0000042	that there is a need in me to reach out and perhaps
YOU1000000186_S0000044	you are lucky to have a position where people will listen
YOU1000000186_S0000046	i would like to use it to the best of my abilities
YOU1000000186_S0000048	so i guess that is why i have moved into the space that i have it is for my own emotional or mental you know peace of mind and satisfaction
YOU1000000186_S0000049	and bill gates
YOU1000000186_S0000051	you have also got a little more emotional in phase 2
YOU1000000186_S0000052	i have seen you almost choke up talking about your dad about how your wife motivated you how your dad is your hero and how all this means a little more to your heart than your head
YOU1000000186_S0000053	so what motivated you to make this change
YOU1000000186_S0000055	i think it is very similar i loved my career in software and being part of building microsoft the personal computer industry the internet
YOU1000000186_S0000056	in my 20s and 30s i was fanatical
YOU1000000186_S0000057	yeah
YOU1000000186_S0000058	and i saw what innovation could do
YOU1000000186_S0000059	but there came a point where i thought hey i should turn that work over to other people
YOU1000000186_S0000060	and think about how innovation does not naturally benefit everyone it does not reach down to the poorest in fact i would gotten a chance to see some of that as i traveled the world
YOU1000000186_S0000061	and as a big believer in innovation i thought ok we can push it in that direction
YOU1000000186_S0000062	and so it is allowed me to learn a lot of new things
YOU1000000186_S0000063	and i would not be able to do it except for the lock the visibility the resources that came from that 1st career
YOU1000000186_S0000064	and i actually use a lot of what i learned then in terms of engaging scientists and driving innovation as fast as we can
YOU1000000186_S0000065	and how important was your wife in this chapter 2 of your life
YOU1000000186_S0000067	when i 1st said to my wife that i was considering retiring from my full time work at microsoft in a
YOU1000000186_S0000069	are you crazy
YOU1000000186_S0000070	well no she was careful not to jump on it because she wanted it to be my decision
YOU1000000186_S0000071	yeah
YOU1000000186_S0000072	that i would never look back and felt like i would really picked the time that i felt comfortable with that because it had been so central to my life
YOU1000000186_S0000073	right
YOU1000000186_S0000074	but she was certainly enthused about it during my time at microsoft i would always had somebody who was
YOU1000000186_S0000076	my key partner paul allen
YOU1000000186_S0000078	steve ballmer as the company became big and complicated
YOU1000000186_S0000079	now in this era it is really my wife who is my .
YOU1000000186_S0000081	and so we get to do this together
YOU1000000186_S0000082	and great motivator she is a driving force behind a lot of what you do
YOU1000000186_S0000083	absolutely she is very energetic about these things she is actually in malaysia this week at a women delivers conference talking about reproductive health and how women get access to those tools
YOU1000000186_S0000084	so she is equally passionate and also had a microsoft career so some of the ways we think about measurement and managing people getting the best people
YOU1000000186_S0000085	we have got a common background
YOU1000000186_S0000086	amir when bill gates launched into this phase 2 he talked to and convinced a lot of billionaires around the world especially warren buffett
YOU1000000186_S0000087	to donate a lot to be philanthropic and donate to his organization or to other organizations and to make change
YOU1000000186_S0000088	what about in india we do not see enough of that we have got a great example of .
YOU1000000186_S0000090	who you highlighted in your .
YOU1000000186_S0000091	yeah in our show we did showcase what mister
YOU1000000186_S0000093	doing and i think he is doing really wonderful work and really we should all take cue from that
YOU1000000186_S0000094	and certainly i feel that i mean i do believe that in india there is a lot of philanthropy
YOU1000000186_S0000095	yeah
YOU1000000186_S0000097	huge amounts that we often donate but it is usually to religious
YOU1000000186_S0000098	right
YOU1000000186_S0000099	organizations we donate a lot to religion
YOU1000000186_S0000100	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000101	maybe that is a need in us to try and safeguard our people
YOU1000000186_S0000103	insurance policy
YOU1000000186_S0000104	yeah you know because we feel that if we donate a lot to temples or mosques or you know religious institutions and that is where i see most of the big donations going so it is not that we do not donate
YOU1000000186_S0000105	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000106	we donate huge amounts but they go into religious institutions whereas we do not donate into education or into healthcare
YOU1000000186_S0000108	and i personally feel that if you donate into education and healthcare
YOU1000000186_S0000110	the god up there is going to be really happy
YOU1000000186_S0000112	probably be happier so i mean i think that i think it is time that people who are well off financially in india and who would like to contribute to nation building
YOU1000000186_S0000113	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000114	to building this nation into what it can be and to trying to achieve its full potential for the youth for the kids of our country
YOU1000000186_S0000115	and for the emotional happiness for all of us then that is one area that we can really help in
YOU1000000186_S0000116	do you think it is like .
YOU1000000186_S0000117	in donating huge sums into education healthcare and other such things
YOU1000000186_S0000119	rather than just religion
YOU1000000186_S0000120	do you think you need 2 hands to clap it is a bit of a failure on the lack of institutions that they can feel safe that the money has gone to the right place
YOU1000000186_S0000121	like if you donate to the prime minister is relief fund you just feel god knows what will happen where it will go part of the budget
YOU1000000186_S0000122	but if you have got something an indian equivalent of the gates foundation or something where you know .
YOU1000000186_S0000123	i spend the money here it is not going to go too much to salaries it is going to go targeted
YOU1000000186_S0000124	i do not agree with that entirely
YOU1000000186_S0000126	because i feel that while yes we are concerned about you know where are we putting our money
YOU1000000186_S0000127	or where are we doing the ending that is a concern which all of us should have certainly but i do not think that you will not find any institution or
YOU1000000186_S0000129	and you will if you really are interested
YOU1000000186_S0000131	that is not a sufficient excuse as far as i am concerned
YOU1000000186_S0000132	so bill gates when you meet indian entrepreneurs billionaires are you getting any traction with them that they should also donate to the 2nd miracle of vaccines
YOU1000000186_S0000133	well i am sure that philanthropy in india will continue to grow
YOU1000000186_S0000134	i think there is an awareness that although the government can do a lot that there are some things that are innovative
YOU1000000186_S0000135	whether it is good schools showing the way on that with people like
YOU1000000186_S0000137	who i think do an amazing job and i am sure there is others out there like that
YOU1000000186_S0000138	in agriculture there is
YOU1000000186_S0000140	you know getting smart young people getting out there pushing innovative techniques
YOU1000000186_S0000141	and so yes philanthropy is going to grow the only thing i do is i as people are interested in philanthropy i share with them how much fun it can be
YOU1000000186_S0000142	and talk to them about the fact that as you move from the place that you were successful usually in business you are going to feel a little uncomfortable
YOU1000000186_S0000143	because you are going to be in an area where the measures are not as clear
YOU1000000186_S0000144	and you have not had the 20 or 30 year period of experience where you are really familiar with the territory
YOU1000000186_S0000145	you will have to engage with the government at least to show the way on certain issues so it is tricky
YOU1000000186_S0000146	i think one of the earliest philanthropists anywhere was the tata family
YOU1000000186_S0000147	they were actually a few years even before rockefeller and carnegie
YOU1000000186_S0000148	and i learned a lot from those early foundations because they were pretty brilliant in what they did
YOU1000000186_S0000149	yes
YOU1000000186_S0000150	and i think the more people give the more awesome premjis there are the more it makes other people think okay should i do the same
YOU1000000186_S0000151	and so i hope
YOU1000000186_S0000153	that 10 years from now we can say that this was the golden era of philanthropy in india and the rest of the world
YOU1000000186_S0000154	and you do find some traction when you talk to them
YOU1000000186_S0000155	absolutely the interest in discussion is very strong in fact there have been a number of meetings and people are finding their way
YOU1000000186_S0000156	that boundary of how you connect and show models for the government some capacity building is taking place
YOU1000000186_S0000157	the us is in this respect further down the learning curve there is no lack of places to give
YOU1000000186_S0000158	and to some degree the universities have to reach out a little more and say okay here is a program that you could fund
YOU1000000186_S0000159	they should look at how that is happened in the us which is
YOU1000000186_S0000161	very organized beautifully organized universities in america
YOU1000000187_S0000001	so when i was teaching this was one of the tests i would ask you know how you know you are an artist that is the main question
YOU1000000187_S0000002	to know an artist or not is like breathing you do not question breathing you have to breathe otherwise you just die so you breathe so if you wake up in the morning
YOU1000000187_S0000003	and you have some ideas and you have to make them and this becomes like a kind of almost obsession and you have to create and you have this urge to create you are definitely an artist
YOU1000000187_S0000004	but you are not a great artist you are just an artist to be a great artist there is all different types of rules and you really have to .
YOU1000000187_S0000005	you have to kind of it is like he obsessed you it is like there is nothing else in your mind
YOU1000000187_S0000006	the only advice you ever hear is something you already know and it just gets confirmed if you think of all the advice that you have heard 50 pieces of advice people .
YOU1000000187_S0000007	and there may be 3 or 4 pieces of advice you can think of having taken
YOU1000000187_S0000008	when i was really young william burroughs told me i was really struggling we never had any money
YOU1000000187_S0000009	and the advice that william gave me was build a good name keep your name clean
YOU1000000187_S0000010	do not make compromises do not worry about making a bunch of money or being successful be concerned with doing good work
YOU1000000187_S0000011	and make the right choices and protect your work and if you build a good name eventually you know that name will be its own currency
YOU1000000187_S0000012	the only advice i have is probably things that a lot of young musicians and artists already know
YOU1000000187_S0000014	although some of them may have the ambition to be the next jay z or the next whatever
YOU1000000187_S0000015	whatever it is the number of those artists are very very small
YOU1000000187_S0000017	and often the artists who are very successful that way
YOU1000000187_S0000019	they
YOU1000000187_S0000021	they do not have much flexibility in achieving success they kind of lose a lot of their creative freedom
YOU1000000187_S0000022	they have to keep making the same thing more or less over and over and over again and that if the musician or artist values their freedom and their
YOU1000000187_S0000023	the ability to be creative then they have to maybe realize that they will not be making
YOU1000000187_S0000025	100s of 10s of dollars they might be making less money but they might have more artistic satisfaction
YOU1000000187_S0000027	painter photographer filmmaker video artist whatever you do
YOU1000000187_S0000029	nobody else can do that better than you
YOU1000000187_S0000031	i think the thing is we are not we can not impart any kind of wisdom to anyone else we are so immersed in the bullshit of our own activities
YOU1000000187_S0000032	to know even how to give anyone advice
YOU1000000187_S0000034	my advice to younger artists would be something like
YOU1000000187_S0000036	to be very sensitive to where they are in what times in what part of the world and how that
YOU1000000187_S0000038	constitutes the artistic practice the artistic inquiry
YOU1000000187_S0000040	i think the great artists have to be ready to fail which not too many people do because when you have success .
YOU1000000187_S0000041	in a certain way then the public accepts you in a certain way you start somehow involuntarily reproducing the same images the same type of work
YOU1000000187_S0000042	and you are not risking and the real artists always change their territories and they go to the land they have never been
YOU1000000187_S0000043	is unknown territory and then you can fail and you can risk and that failure actually is what makes this this extra
YOU1000000187_S0000044	you know ready to fail that makes great artists
YOU1000000187_S0000046	so it is not that there is not things to say to artists but unless there are the specific things they are going to hear it is .
YOU1000000187_S0000048	it is not worth their while listening or your worth your while telling them so i think it has to do with the specific interaction of the person giving the advice and the person receiving it rather than
YOU1000000187_S0000049	broad nostrils work hard
YOU1000000187_S0000051	do your best do what you like and people will respect you for it it does not matter what subject you take on in the end whatever you do is going to be a self portrait it will reveal who you are
YOU1000000187_S0000052	if it is arrogant it is about you if it is pretentious that is about you do not think you can escape yourself by your choice of subject matter
YOU1000000187_S0000053	there are many things like that that one can say but unless someone is needing those words
YOU1000000187_S0000055	they do not get hurt
YOU1000000187_S0000056	make your own way in the world
YOU1000000187_S0000057	wrap up warm eat properly sensibly
YOU1000000187_S0000058	do not smoke and find your mum
YOU1000000187_S0000059	funny bro
YOU1000000187_S0000061	i had a very old professor really which i love very much and he gave me 2 advices he said to me if you are drawing with your right hand
YOU1000000187_S0000062	and you are getting better and better and become virtuosic so that you will do it with closed eyes
YOU1000000187_S0000064	you can draw anything you want immediately change to the left hand and that was very important advice because when you become a routine that is the end of everything
YOU1000000187_S0000065	and the 2nd great advice he said to me you know in your lifetime you probably will have one good idea if you are a really good artist
YOU1000000187_S0000066	and if you are a genius 2 good ideas and that is it but be careful with that
YOU1000000187_S0000067	do not do anything that you know deep in your heart somebody else can do better but do what nobody else can do except for you
YOU1000000187_S0000069	what i think the best advice is i think working with art is working with something that is very fierce very strong very robust
YOU1000000187_S0000071	and .
YOU1000000187_S0000073	even though the whole world seems to say that art is fragile should be marginalized it is not important it is counterproductive it is .
YOU1000000187_S0000074	does not belong to the center of what reality is defined as artists should have confidence in the fact that well making
YOU1000000187_S0000076	a drawing on a piece of paper is changing the world
YOU1000000187_S0000078	by definition making art is making the world so it is an unbelievably rewarding thing to be an artist
YOU1000000187_S0000079	and to be full behind that idea as a young artist and to actually see that having chosen the in many perspectives strange choice to become an artist
YOU1000000187_S0000080	is also to have chosen to be a part of the world
YOU1000000187_S0000081	to be an artist actually to be a human being in these times it is all difficult you have to go through life hopefully
YOU1000000187_S0000082	you know trying to stay healthy you know being as happy as you can and pursuing you know doing what you want
YOU1000000187_S0000083	if what you want is to have children if what you want is to be a baker if what you want is to live out in the woods or try to save the environment
YOU1000000187_S0000084	or maybe what you want is to write scripts for detective shows it does not really matter you know what matters is to be is to know what you want
YOU1000000187_S0000085	and pursue it and understand that it is going to be hard because life is really difficult
YOU1000000187_S0000086	you are going to lose people you love you are going to suffer heartbreak sometimes you will be sick sometimes you will have a really bad toothache
YOU1000000187_S0000087	sometimes you will be hungry but on the other end you will have the most beautiful experiences sometimes just the sky
YOU1000000187_S0000088	sometimes you know a piece of work that you do that feels so wonderful or you find somebody to love or your children or .
YOU1000000187_S0000089	there is beautiful things in life so when you are suffering just you know it is part of the package you know you look at it we are born
YOU1000000187_S0000090	and we also have to die we know that so it makes sense that we are going to be really happy and things are going to be really fucked up too

YOU1000000189_S0000000	today we are visiting true garden it is a vertical aeroponic food farm i was really excited to go here because
YOU1000000189_S0000001	because i originally stumbled across true garden and their farm on instagram and it is so cool looking it is just a series of columns
YOU1000000189_S0000002	that are covered in different vegetables and fruits that are completely fresh and i was mostly interested to see
YOU1000000189_S0000003	what the biology of growing food was like because vertical farms grow food in a very different and sustainable way
YOU1000000189_S0000004	my name is troy albright i am actually a licensed pharmacist as i have done consults on my patients i realize it starts with the food they are putting in their body
YOU1000000189_S0000005	troy is a licensed pharmacist by trade he went through school in the very modern medical way of doing things
YOU1000000189_S0000006	and through the process of having children of his own with their own illnesses and conditions and also being overweight himself
YOU1000000189_S0000007	he changed how he approached food and what he put in his body and it changed everything for him and his family
YOU1000000189_S0000008	my parents and grandparents were farmers in minnesota and we had black soil there here in arizona the soil is like this red clay stuff
YOU1000000189_S0000009	sure
YOU1000000189_S0000010	so if you do not amend it and really work that soil you do not get a lot of good quality produce out of it so when i saw the tower garden i can control the environment
YOU1000000189_S0000011	i control the water i control the nutrients i love this i can control every aspect of growing my own food
YOU1000000189_S0000012	so how does this whole process work basically the 1st step is to put whatever seeds you want into the coconut coir
YOU1000000189_S0000013	this grow medium here is coco core it is actually a certified organic grow medium and it is a byproduct of coconut husk and you throw it put your seeds in there
YOU1000000189_S0000014	and then once they are one to 2 inches tall like this we can come over here and just plant these right in here they fit right in the pod
YOU1000000189_S0000015	you throw it in the pump turns on every 3 to 15 minutes depending on the program pumps the water and the nutrient solution all the way up to the top and then just using the law of physics
YOU1000000189_S0000016	yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000017	what goes up comes down right
YOU1000000189_S0000018	yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000019	and it just rains down there is a shower cap rains down and hits all these spots
YOU1000000189_S0000020	so something i find interesting is that you only need that amount of soil
YOU1000000189_S0000021	like
YOU1000000189_S0000022	like you envision just miles and miles of dirt and soil to grow plants but you only need that amount
YOU1000000189_S0000023	yep that is all i need
YOU1000000189_S0000024	for every different plant that you are growing
YOU1000000189_S0000025	nope just that small amount it is actually not even soil it is coconut husk if we use soil we would have a lot more bugs we would have to use pesticides and herbicides and fungicides i choose not to use any of those here
YOU1000000189_S0000026	organic is what just food
YOU1000000189_S0000027	yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000028	do you think that is really happening today
YOU1000000189_S0000029	well by the way you just said that now
YOU1000000189_S0000031	vegetables typically that are transported into your state by law even if they are organic are sprayed with pesticides
YOU1000000189_S0000032	so that is not ideal
YOU1000000189_S0000033	the problem is our soils are depleted the fda has lots of studies showing that when those leafy greens are cut they travel what on average 1200 to 1500 miles to get to your plate
YOU1000000189_S0000034	they come across pesticides
YOU1000000189_S0000035	yeah pesticides are 50% less nutrients they have lost up to 50% in some cases there is hardly any nutritional value
YOU1000000189_S0000037	here look at some of this basil let us grab a beautiful basil plant pull this out look at those beautiful roots on there
YOU1000000189_S0000038	0 my gosh
YOU1000000189_S0000039	i mean look at that
YOU1000000189_S0000040	that is insane
YOU1000000189_S0000041	this is 21 days old yeah
YOU1000000189_S0000042	the vegetables that we saw at true garden were just growing right there there was no soil there was minimal water
YOU1000000189_S0000043	it was really just their roots hanging in these hollow tubes being saturated in nutrient dense substances and growing to be the most beautiful vegetables
YOU1000000189_S0000044	if we pull one out here it is like a beautiful bouquet let us get one out of here so you can see i mean the roots you got these beautiful roots
YOU1000000189_S0000045	now i know what my bouquet is going to be for my wedding
YOU1000000189_S0000046	yes
YOU1000000189_S0000047	0 my gosh it is so soft
YOU1000000189_S0000048	yeah is not that something why do not you try a piece of that
YOU1000000189_S0000049	vegetables have a much more vibrant and bolder and fuller flavor than i think most of us have experienced
YOU1000000189_S0000050	i feel like it tastes different than what i am used to like i feel like most romaine lettuce tastes so watered down
YOU1000000189_S0000051	summer is over this is even better
YOU1000000189_S0000052	i do not feel like i have ever tasted romaine that was this sweet it is stronger it is more unique from vegetable to vegetable
YOU1000000189_S0000053	because you are not getting that dirt flavor a lot of that comes from growing the fruit or vegetable in this coconut husk
YOU1000000189_S0000054	and feeding it with these nutrient substances without any soil it is amazing
YOU1000000189_S0000055	i do not know how i have not eaten vegetables this fresh before and i feel like everyone needs to like i buy expensive freaking spinach at the store
YOU1000000189_S0000056	all organic everything whole paycheck at whole foods it happens but it does not taste like this
YOU1000000189_S0000057	when they grow most spinach in sands a lot of times when you crunch on spinach
YOU1000000189_S0000058	you got like a grainy taste to that
YOU1000000189_S0000059	that is the sand that they grow it in so you always want to rinse it well and get rid of that
YOU1000000189_S0000060	one of the craziest things i tried was the stevia leaf
YOU1000000189_S0000061	here try just a piece of this okay just a really small amount
YOU1000000189_S0000065	what is that
YOU1000000189_S0000066	it is a natural plant sweetener
YOU1000000189_S0000067	i just want to eat this as like an after dinner dessert and then i will never eat ice cream again
YOU1000000189_S0000068	it is not i mean that is so sweet is not it
YOU1000000189_S0000069	yeah i have had the stevia powder but never a stevia leaf 0 that is stevia
YOU1000000189_S0000070	this is the actual stevia plant here
YOU1000000189_S0000071	wow that is amazing you could use it in so many things and it is so powerful i also tried a mint chocolate herb
YOU1000000189_S0000072	and it tasted just like mint chocolate
YOU1000000189_S0000073	so once we have a sprout we put it in the tower 26 days later you have that things grow super fast
YOU1000000189_S0000074	26 days
YOU1000000189_S0000075	yes
YOU1000000189_S0000077	so what happens is you get accelerated growth because the roots can get a lot of oxygen
YOU1000000189_S0000079	since there is no soil there is no weeds which is amazing because pooling weeds is literally the worst weekend activity ever
YOU1000000189_S0000080	vertical farming it is just your head of lettuce or your kale or your spinach or your berries or your tomatoes no bugs no weeds
YOU1000000189_S0000081	what is the actual benefit of having a vertical farm versus having a normal farm that we are used to seeing
YOU1000000189_S0000082	big part of it is with a vertical farm we are really saving on space we can use 90% less land but we can grow 90% more food
YOU1000000189_S0000083	when you go vertical like this this is 110th of an acre we can grow 10 times more food as a result of going vertical
YOU1000000189_S0000084	plus our resources we use 90 to 98% less water that is huge i mean what 3% of the water in the world is fresh water
YOU1000000189_S0000085	so it is not just a commodity here in the united states but all over the world having fresh water so we got to really conserve our resources and if we do not .
YOU1000000189_S0000086	we are setting ourselves up for major catastrophe
YOU1000000189_S0000087	how many people do you think you could feed just out of this space
YOU1000000189_S0000088	out of this space we could easily feed gosh 100 families on a weekly basis
YOU1000000189_S0000089	wow as we all know our world is changing the land available to us is changing the quality soil that we have on our earth is changing
YOU1000000189_S0000090	and this may be the most sustainable way to feed our communities moving forward
YOU1000000189_S0000091	what would be your top 3 tips for doing that
YOU1000000189_S0000092	grow the things you love to eat keep it simple use clean water use good quality seedlings we have got residential models
YOU1000000189_S0000093	as well as commercial farms
YOU1000000189_S0000094	model
YOU1000000189_S0000095	so the residential model is about 5 or 6 feet tall just like you are and one to 2 towers could easily feed a family of 4 depending on what you are growing
YOU1000000189_S0000096	you are going to be exposed to less chemicals you will love it you will really love it
YOU1000000189_S0000097	i was a skeptic i absolutely thought the biology of this food must be different if we are not making it with soil and the same amount of water
YOU1000000189_S0000098	and the same amount of sunlight as the vegetables and fruits we are used to but the matter of the fact is it is better it has got more nutrients more minerals
YOU1000000189_S0000099	it is more dense in the rich vitamins that your body needs and it is just more environmentally friendly
YOU1000000189_S0000100	you know as a compounding pharmacist i do consults and i got into this because i really saw not just my own kids but my own patients that were missing the food part
YOU1000000189_S0000101	they were missing that nutrition part and as i corrected nutrition in them i am like 0 my this changed their whole life
YOU1000000189_S0000102	we were taught in pharmacy school just give a drug give a drug give a drug drugs are just band aids they do not cure us if you do not have good nutrition
YOU1000000189_S0000103	that foundation that we are building our body on is not there and so that leads to all sorts of things you know depression leaky gut gum disease
YOU1000000189_S0000104	people that are constantly having headaches they are not growing properly our kids do not grow properly because of nutrition so it starts with good foundation
YOU1000000189_S0000105	if you have a good foundation with nutrition eat it watch you grow or buy it locally you are going to be way healthier
YOU1000000189_S0000106	it is so crazy how your diet can affect pretty much everything it is hard to put into a sentence how cool and interesting i thought this whole experience was
YOU1000000189_S0000107	i have always been a firm believer in what you put in your body matters and the food you put in your body matters
YOU1000000189_S0000108	and we are allowing food industries to spray it with pesticides to transport it super far change its enzymes and nutritional benefits
YOU1000000189_S0000109	so that when we are receiving the food it is not even giving us the fuel that we need to survive in a healthy way
YOU1000000189_S0000110	the body is an incredible piece of equipment machinery you put good stuff in it gives good stuff out if you put bad stuff in in time bad stuff is going to come out
YOU1000000189_S0000111	but you can correct it it just takes some effort on our part to do what is right who said that in hippocrates you are what you eat let food be medicine let medicine be food
YOU1000000189_S0000112	he said it a lot more eloquently but i firmly believe that
YOU1000000189_S0000113	true garden was quite possibly one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen it was pristine it was green
YOU1000000189_S0000114	not fake green not sprayed on green it was beautiful vibrant green
YOU1000000189_S0000115	and the oxygen in that greenhouse i would like to one day live in a greenhouse with that pure oxygen
YOU1000000189_S0000116	i am really grateful for the opportunity to learn about my health to learn about my food and also to share the information with you guys
YOU1000000189_S0000118	in hopes that it maybe changes one thing you do not have to change everything overnight do one thing that will make you better tomorrow than you are today
YOU1000000189_S0000120	thank you guys so much for watching it was one of my favorite videos to make and share with you all if you care about health and wellness and want to learn more
YOU1000000189_S0000121	you should definitely watch our tutorial on how to make natural cleaning supplies because what you spray around in the air around you matters too
YOU1000000191_S0000000	so we are going to get this plate all the way down there i had my weetabix this morning
YOU1000000191_S0000001	good morning everyone if you have not already do not forget to hit the subscribe button and ring the little bell
YOU1000000191_S0000002	videos every tuesday and friday and the odd occasion we do the sunday video what is going on we are going to take a couple of polls
YOU1000000191_S0000003	in today is video i am walking into my cow field we have moved the electric fence back into this field and we are going to look at something very exciting we are doing something very exciting today
YOU1000000191_S0000004	you would have seen when we put the cow brush back up in january it was very wet it was very horrible
YOU1000000191_S0000005	it was gross but the cows loved the cow bros
YOU1000000191_S0000007	i currently have 2 cows fighting over the brush surely this means i need another one
YOU1000000191_S0000009	they absolutely loved it you would have seen them using it all the time this is in the past couple of weeks
YOU1000000191_S0000010	and the guys at mayo cow comfort and fineasy would like to send me another cow brush
YOU1000000191_S0000011	but this cow brush is something different a cow brush that goes into the field
YOU1000000191_S0000012	so obviously our cows are happily grazing we have about .
YOU1000000191_S0000014	10 standing up and the other 110 are chilling out bellies full of grass
YOU1000000191_S0000015	getting a bit of that sun our plan is they are going to send me a cow brush that goes into the field which is great
YOU1000000191_S0000016	so instead of using my brand new fences that we did for a viewing area back at the farm shop we are going to use a calvary which is going to be fantastic
YOU1000000191_S0000017	i was thinking of putting it with the highlands that are in the paddock there but then i thought why give it a highlands when there is only 4
YOU1000000191_S0000018	when we have got 123 i think in the moment in the milking herd
YOU1000000191_S0000019	why do not we put it in here so it is going to get used literally 22 times more
YOU1000000191_S0000020	desmondo is coming soon and we are going to find a position to put it up
YOU1000000191_S0000021	i am going to guess here because i want to have it in an area where the cows can use it people can see it from the farm shop when they come out of the farm shop and they see the view and area of the
YOU1000000191_S0000022	horse and the island might be something else coming as well yeah it is very exciting so that is the idea
YOU1000000191_S0000023	i am going to put a white pole to say this is where i would like it
YOU1000000191_S0000024	this is the position and desmondo is coming in a minute desmondo imagine you are a normal human can you see this here this is me pretending to be a cow brush
YOU1000000191_S0000025	dead yet
YOU1000000191_S0000027	all we are doing now is we have got to wait for male cow comfort to come
YOU1000000191_S0000029	so we had 2 positions and i think your eye does take that one out
YOU1000000191_S0000030	it is a little bit further away
YOU1000000191_S0000031	desmond is always right
YOU1000000191_S0000032	i
YOU1000000191_S0000033	just accept it
YOU1000000191_S0000034	not true
YOU1000000191_S0000035	chris is back chris did such a good job they have sent him again he leaves with chris today

YOU1000000191_S0000062	okay
YOU1000000191_S0000064	we not just tie the poles to the cows and let them walk
YOU1000000191_S0000065	i think that would be a better idea
YOU1000000191_S0000066	cow power instead of horses we have 2 horses in there
YOU1000000191_S0000067	i will tell you which one would do it amazingly easily samuel little shetland

YOU1000000191_S0000133	thank you to fineasy and mayo cow comfort for coming
YOU1000000191_S0000134	and installing a cow brush they saw that the cows loved it in this back shed and they brought one for my outside because we know these cows are outside
YOU1000000191_S0000135	or 6 months a year as well it is part of their range again it needs no power
YOU1000000191_S0000136	it can live inside and go pressure wash outside and what you can do as well is you can unbolt the base of it
YOU1000000191_S0000137	and then we can put it into the concrete area so if you had a large area where cows kind of roam or free roaming a loafing area
YOU1000000191_S0000138	if you want to be technicale you can place this inside for the other 6 months when the cows do come inside so it is very versatile
YOU1000000191_S0000139	perfect for us we do not have the space to put this inside currently but who knows things could change and cow straight on it go
YOU1000000191_S0000140	thank you very much thank you to male comfort and finn easy for placing it really do appreciate it please give the video a thumbs up
