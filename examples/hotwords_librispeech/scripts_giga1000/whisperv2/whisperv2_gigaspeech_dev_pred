POD1000000004_S0000000	Hey friends, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, I knew absolutely nothing about money. Well, there's a new show from Marketplace and Brains on that will help address just that.
POD1000000004_S0000001	Million Bazillion is a new podcast for kids and their families. It's all about money, how it works, how we use it, where it comes from, and how we could all get a little bit smarter about it, but in a fun way.
POD1000000004_S0000002	Million Bazillion, helping dollars make more sense. This podcast is presented in partnership with Greenlight, the debit card for kids. Listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.
POD1000000004_S0000003	Leila Green is a trauma surgeon in Houston.
POD1000000004_S0000004	I meet people on the worst day of their life, usually.
POD1000000004_S0000005	Well, then I guess I should be glad we didn't meet in real life. Before Leela could become Dr. Green, she had to do a whole lot of training.
POD1000000004_S0000006	And you know what's really hard to do when you're working a bonkers number of hours? Eat properly.
POD1000000004_S0000007	I was in general surgery residency at the time and kind of tired of eating like hospital food or fast food and things.
POD1000000004_S0000008	And that's when she heard about this service, a meal kit delivery that would send her all the ingredients she'd need to make three full meals, plus instructions on how to make them. No more time-consuming trips to the grocery store and no more desperation Big Macs.
POD1000000004_S0000009	So I said, well, I'll try it. I got a free box. And so I said, OK, I can do this. And I lived by myself. So I thought it would be something fun to do.
POD1000000004_S0000010	What Green is conveniently leaving out of her story is her level of cooking experience pre-meal kit.
POD1000000004_S0000011	I can heat things up?
POD1000000004_S0000013	What?
POD1000000004_S0000014	I had to buy so many different things. Like once these boxes started coming, you need all these like equipment and things that I didn't have. I had to buy zesters.
POD1000000004_S0000015	And like I didn't have a garlic press. What is this? Okay, but I you know, I'm a surgeon so I have to have all the right instruments. What do you
POD1000000004_S0000017	you know, to put this stuff together.
POD1000000004_S0000018	Getting a meal kit every week did force Green to upgrade her kitchen utensil game. But more importantly, it gave her back time. Something that, as a trauma surgeon, she does not take for granted.
POD1000000004_S0000019	Plus, the meal kits help Green hone her cooking skills. Forget just pressing cook on the microwave. Green is now a master in the fine art of mise en place.
POD1000000004_S0000020	You know, you have to learn how to, like, chop everything up and set it aside and...
POD1000000004_S0000021	Right.
POD1000000004_S0000022	You know, you really do have to feel like you're cooking things because you really do have to put everything together.
POD1000000004_S0000023	Right. Now, I would think if you were a surgeon, your knife skills wouldn't be too bad.
POD1000000004_S0000024	Oh, no, I mean, I can cut people and carrots, okay. I could, you know.
POD1000000004_S0000025	In the year that Green subscribed to that meal kit delivery service, she made seared steak and pizza from scratch and a whole host of other things she would never normally prepare for herself. And she documented her cooking journey on Instagram.
POD1000000004_S0000026	But eventually, Green finished her training and got back to a more regular schedule, which allowed for grocery shopping and meal prep. So she canceled her subscription.
POD1000000004_S0000027	Which was bad news for the meal kit service she was using, Blue Apron. You may be familiar with the company from such podcasts as All of Them.

POD1000000004_S0000041	When Blue Apron began in 2012, it was supposed to revolutionize how Americans ate. It was going to gently pull us away from our takeout and our TV dinners and nudge us back into the kitchen. And for a while it worked, until it didn't.
POD1000000004_S0000042	and Americans returned to the warm embrace of their boxed mac and cheese and takeout pad thai. Obviously, a home cooking revolution didn't materialize.
POD1000000004_S0000043	Or did it? The novel coronavirus has forced many of us to become intimately acquainted with our casserole dishes and our garlic presses and our Dutch ovens.
POD1000000004_S0000044	We made banana bread by the pallet and sourdough starter by the ton. We learned how to sear steaks and spatchcock chickens and all manner of gruesome carnivorous techniques. In short, boy did we ever cook.
POD1000000004_S0000045	All this cooking at home created a make or break moment for Blue Apron. But it wasn't supposed to be like that. Just a few years ago, the company was valued at $2 billion. Now, it was barely hanging on by its fingernails.
POD1000000004_S0000046	It's only lifeline a global health crisis that required so many of us to shelter in place for months and avoid trips to the grocery store.
POD1000000004_S0000047	I'm Lauren Oberin from American Public Media. Welcome to the new season of Spectacular Failures, the show that always flambes the hell out of failure.
POD1000000004_S0000049	Legend has it that the idea for Blue Apron began with an Argentinian steak. There were these two guys, Matt Salzberg and Elia Pappas, and they were clever tech entrepreneur types.
POD1000000004_S0000050	full of ideas. Salzberg had an MBA from Harvard and cut his teeth in a big New York venture capital firm. Pappas was a go-getter software engineer. They met at a network-y happy hour and decided to go into business together.
POD1000000004_S0000051	But what kind of business?
POD1000000004_S0000052	Their original idea is not meal kits. It is more of a research crowdfunding idea called Petri Dish.
POD1000000004_S0000053	That's Alex Conrad. He's a senior editor at Forbes. He wrote about the founders in 2015. Petri dish wasn't the pair's only startup idea.
POD1000000004_S0000054	I think another one we highlighted in our article was Warby Parker for strollers.
POD1000000004_S0000055	Don't even understand.
POD1000000004_S0000057	A high-end but also affordable stroller experience. Yeah.
POD1000000004_S0000058	So those two startup ideas, a Kickstarter for science experiments and a Warby Parker for strollers, were non-starters for the pair. But then, over grilled meat, it hit them.
POD1000000004_S0000059	Salzburg and Pappas are doing dinner and they're struggling to make Argentinian steaks on a borrowed grill.
POD1000000004_S0000060	And they're like, you know, wouldn't it be great if there's a service basically for amateurs like us?
POD1000000004_S0000061	In fact, there was. But it was in Sweden. In 2007, a woman named Kiki Tjander created a company called
POD1000000004_S0000062	Middagsfrid, that translates into dinner piece in English.
POD1000000004_S0000063	Let me see if I can pronounce this right. Midaskreet.
POD1000000004_S0000064	That's pretty good.
POD1000000004_S0000065	Tiander wanted to solve the vexing nightly problem that families around the world face. What are we having for dinner? Because the answer can't always be ice cream.
POD1000000004_S0000066	People started talking about hell hour, you know, like the hour between five and six when you have to run to the grocery store and fight with your spouse about who's cooking tonight, what are we having.
POD1000000004_S0000067	That right there is the spirit of entrepreneurship.
POD1000000004_S0000068	I think the question is, then, is this a legitimately huge problem? And is this a problem that a lot of people have as well?
POD1000000004_S0000069	For Salzburg and Pappas, the answer to both of those questions was an enthusiastic yes! Now, at this point, it was 2012, and Tiander's company had been around for five years and was growing steadily.
POD1000000004_S0000070	It had a few competitors in Europe, but in the U.S., nothing of the sort existed, which was great for Salzburg and Pappas.
POD1000000004_S0000071	And so they think, hey, we can start our own meal kit company for the U.S. market called Part and Parsley.
POD1000000004_S0000072	To be clear, that's a terrible name. And very quickly, they changed it to Blue Apron, named for what French apprentice chefs wear in the kitchen.
POD1000000004_S0000073	At almost the exact same time, a Harvard classmate of Salzburg's began a rival meal kit company called Plated. But Salzburg and Pappas weren't worried, because they had brought on a ringer.
POD1000000004_S0000074	Matt Wadiak, a chef with a degree from the prestigious Culinary Institute of America. And Wadiak was the guy that was going to make their business stand apart from its rivals.
POD1000000004_S0000075	Wadiak would basically go and source the ingredients. Farmers would say, okay, we would love to lock in these large extra orders.
POD1000000004_S0000076	at a scale that is very attractive to us, you know, many thousands of ingredients. I think, you know, when he was in his food world, that was a differentiator and great for Blue Apron.
POD1000000004_S0000077	Not only did Wadiak design the menus and source the products, but he also served as the social media face of the company. He was Blue Apron's culinary secret weapon and did a series of early YouTube videos showcasing his know-how.
POD1000000004_S0000078	Here he is trying to convince us that artichokes aren't vile.
POD1000000004_S0000079	Everybody likes artichokes, but they are crazy. What do you do with them? They're tough. They're spiny. They're all over the place They're kind of confusing a lot of times people just don't cook them because they don't understand how to cook them so
POD1000000004_S0000081	He cuts into some truly revolting artichokes and proceeds to make my worst dining nightmare.
POD1000000004_S0000082	and get in there with a spoon and scoop out that really hairy, choky interior. And the reason why they call it the choke is because if you eat this, you're going to choke. It's full of little fibers, and it's like a fish bone.
POD1000000004_S0000083	In the early days, all the founders had to hustle like this. Before they had staff, it was Salzburg, Pappas, and Wadiak packing up boxes in a small kitchen in Long Island City, New York.
POD1000000004_S0000084	Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the company landed some sweet venture capital to the tune of $3 million. Things were looking good for the startup.
POD1000000004_S0000085	Within the first few years, the business took off. In 2014, Blue Apron was shipping 600,000 meals a month. By 2016, it was 8 million meals and a billion dollars in revenue.
POD1000000004_S0000086	Within just five years of its founding, the company employed 4,500 people and was valued at nearly $2 billion. Blue Apron looked like it was on the express train to successville.
POD1000000004_S0000087	Huapron seemed to be sort of the buzziest, the biggest market share, the leader in this emerging category.
POD1000000004_S0000088	which included HelloFresh, SunBasket, and about a million companies with the word chef in the name.
POD1000000004_S0000089	Then I actually tried the products and it seemed at least to me personally, just as someone testing the products, that Blue Apron overall kind of had the experience that resonated the most with me and I thought might resonate the most with Americans.
POD1000000004_S0000090	Now, the thing about Americans is,
POD1000000004_S0000091	We love products that claim to make our lives easier, more convenient, less of a hassle. And that's exactly what Blue Apron was doing. It was saying, Hey, working mom, we know you have a lot on your plate, LOL.
POD1000000004_S0000092	We want to help you cook nutritious and delicious meals for your family without the hassle of going to the grocery store or reading a cookbook.
POD1000000004_S0000093	But it was also saying, Hey millennial, we know you're a work hard, play hard, eat sloppy, take out at 9pm kind of person. But we also know that you'd love to cook if only it wasn't such a time consuming pain in the ass.
POD1000000004_S0000094	So we're gonna make it super convenient for you.
POD1000000004_S0000096	This American obsession with convenience around food, and in particular the magical home-cooked meal minus the effort, goes back to at least the late 19th century, says culinary historian Laura Shapiro.
POD1000000004_S0000097	That was when a particular brand of utopian fiction began to emerge.
POD1000000004_S0000098	The plot was sort of the same. Somebody is taking a walk, they get bonked on the head. When they wake up, it's 500 years in the future and they're surrounded by all these strange looking creatures and it's a whole different world.
POD1000000004_S0000099	and somebody takes them to dinner. They take them home to dinner and it's a miracle dinner.
POD1000000004_S0000100	The food just appeared with the press of a button or the wave of an arm. And it was scrumptious and filling and, most importantly back then, digestible.
POD1000000004_S0000101	miracle food, it was utopian food, and that has been a dream, I think, that has attached itself to the American dinner table for decades and decades.
POD1000000004_S0000102	Not long after the emergence of this utopian fiction, dining actually did start to look like a miracle. You could buy vegetables in a can, and chicken in a can, and later full meals like spaghetti and meatballs in a can.
POD1000000004_S0000103	Then in the 1950s came the frozen turkey dinner. Just whack it in the oven and presto, a rubbery simulacrum of the real thing. But it was quick and cleanup was a breeze.
POD1000000004_S0000104	Mother Murphy, lucky me! My wife uses Swanson TV turkey dinners. And make your husband lucky, too. Get Swanson TV turkey dinners, Swanson TV fried chicken dinners.
POD1000000004_S0000105	Swanson TV beef dinners from your grocer's big freezer.
POD1000000004_S0000106	When Frozen Fish Sticks hit the scene around the same time, ooh buddy, it was utopian fiction come to life.
POD1000000004_S0000107	Master Chad Morley ate Mrs. Paul's fish sticks with his fingers.
POD1000000004_S0000108	Now I'm 32, and I use a fork. Sometimes.
POD1000000004_S0000109	Mrs. Paul's fish sticks. You'll never stop loving them.
POD1000000004_S0000110	It was an immediate success. These, you know, deep fried frozen fish sticks that tasted not at all of fish, which meant that people adored them.
POD1000000004_S0000111	Obviously, fish sticks took off, and the industry used that as an excuse to stickify everything. Chicken, eggplant, lima beans, whatever you could deep fry and freeze, the packaged food industry tried it.
POD1000000004_S0000112	The post-war year has also brought an explosion of fast food and takeout meals. And now in the 21st century, we can order just about any food we want, from some vegan drumsticks to a pre-fixed haute cuisine meal just by pressing an app.
POD1000000004_S0000113	All of these iterations of the miracle dinner, it's like they aim at three longings that women have always had when they think about making dinner. They want it to be effortless.
POD1000000004_S0000114	They want it to be delicious and they want it to have the moral value of home cooking.
POD1000000004_S0000115	The home cooking aspect of this is perhaps the most resonant.
POD1000000004_S0000116	The thing that home cooking delivers that none of these other things do is that it satisfies, I think, what we all feel as the moral imperative to cook.
POD1000000004_S0000117	There's something that just doesn't click in when the thing comes in from outside.
POD1000000004_S0000118	And this is a great thing for a company like Blue Apron because...
POD1000000004_S0000119	blue apron inches a little closer to that. It just it gets you that much closer to feeling as though you have cooked this.
POD1000000004_S0000120	Notice Shapiro said feeling as though you cooked something. Because for her, what Blue Apron is doing, despite all of its fresh ingredients and chef-inspired recipes, is helping you assemble.
POD1000000004_S0000121	they kind of fool you into thinking you're cooking. Whereas real cooking, hands-on cooking, knowledgeable cooking, has to do with cooking day after day.
POD1000000004_S0000122	Doesn't mean you're making fabulous elaborate meals day after day, even if it's the simplest possible thing. That's cooking.
POD1000000004_S0000123	Sure, getting a dime bag of za'atar, a thimble full of pepitas, and a literal tablespoon of sesame oil in your meal kit does have a somewhat infantilizing effect.
POD1000000004_S0000124	But in Blue Apron's early years, plenty of people were happy to have everything portioned out for them. But convincing potential customers that they wanted and needed a service like that? That cost the company some big cash.
POD1000000004_S0000125	in the form of free meals, tons of specials, and endless advertising. Anyone who listened to podcasts in 2015 through 2018 is bound to have heard at least one disinterested podcast host give a lackluster Blue Apron ad read.
POD1000000004_S0000127	In biz speak, all of this is known as the CAC or customer acquisition cost.
POD1000000004_S0000128	What it's supposed to be is the total amount of money that the company spent.
POD1000000004_S0000129	on marketing to acquire customers, divided by the number of customers that they actually acquired.
POD1000000004_S0000130	That's Dan McCarthy. He's a marketing professor at Emory University's Business School, and he's studied Blue Apron for years. McCarthy says that in the early days, Blue Apron was spending about $60-$70 per customer.
POD1000000004_S0000131	But then, as people came and went, Blue Apron had to spend more and more money to get new customers on board. The customer acquisition costs just kept creeping up and up and up until it nearly doubled.
POD1000000004_S0000132	And you can imagine if you're spending $120 just to bring somebody in, when you talk about the amount of profit that you need after that to break even on that customer, that's a tougher proposition.
POD1000000004_S0000133	The more money Blue Apron spent, the harder it was to recoup the investment. Which brings us to the second problem. Preventing customers from bolting once the company has spent all that money to bring them in.
POD1000000004_S0000134	How many customers stick around is measured by a really important metric called churn rate. The churn rate tells you the rate at which customers come into and spin out of the business.
POD1000000004_S0000135	If you're spending a lot of cash to land new customers and they don't stick around long enough to make any money off of them, you have high customer acquisition costs and a high churn rate.
POD1000000004_S0000136	That's where Blue Apron found itself. And even the most basic cooking dodo could tell you that's a gourmet recipe for losing a lot of money.
POD1000000004_S0000137	Our pal Dr. Green used Blue Apron for about a year, which is way longer than most of its customers stuck around.
POD1000000004_S0000138	Yes, about half the people were churning out in a month. By six months, about 70% of their customers were churning out. They just weren't able to keep those customers for as long as they should.
POD1000000004_S0000139	Despite Blue Apron's early success and growth, one nut the company has never been able to crack is how to stop that outflow. How do you get people to subscribe and stay subscribed, at least long enough to make a profit off of them? It's a puzzle.
POD1000000004_S0000140	But, despite its high churn rate, Blue Apron was still the market leader. It had gotten a slight jumpstart on rival HelloFresh and was starting to look real sexy to big investors.
POD1000000004_S0000141	They were the 800-pound gorillas. And even though the space itself wasn't that large at the time, it was still something like $5 billion and growing really quickly.
POD1000000004_S0000142	On its face, business seemed booming. But the whole meal kit market was on the cusp of a shakeup.
POD1000000004_S0000143	In 2017, grocery chains Albertsons and Kroger each picked off competing meal kit companies. Then another blue-apron rival, Chef, abruptly shut down and laid off all its employees, only to be bought a week later.
POD1000000004_S0000144	And so Blue Apron was at a crossroads, says Alex Conrad.
POD1000000004_S0000145	For startups, the most common exits are, you know, you fail, you go public, or you get bought. Those are really the only traditional outcomes. And so for the companies that didn't want to fail, they were going to have to go public someday or sell.
POD1000000004_S0000146	Like that's just the reality.
POD1000000004_S0000147	So Blue Apron had three choices, pack it in, sell, or go public. We're going to take a quick break. When we come back, join me in my outdated condo kitchen as I whip up some delicious Blue Apron meals.
POD1000000004_S0000148	And we explain how the really terrible coronavirus was also a little bit good for Blue Apron. Plus, we gaze into our meal kit crystal ball to see what the future might hold. Spoiler, the future is delicious.

POD1000000004_S0000166	No story about Blue Apron could be called complete without sampling the product, so I ordered up a box. And paid for it, mind you.
POD1000000004_S0000167	Okay, so I just got my blue apron box at my doorstep and when I picked it up, I could not believe how heavy it was.
POD1000000004_S0000168	When the box arrived, it felt like Christmas. Except better because the food wasn't mediocre and arranged in a shrink-wrapped basket.
POD1000000004_S0000169	So, let's crack into this box.
POD1000000004_S0000170	Inside there were two bunches of kale, some loose onions, and about a million tiny baggies of knickknacks, including two tablespoons of creme fraiche, a quarter of a cup of panko breadcrumbs, and one teaspoon of something called furikake.
POD1000000004_S0000171	which according to the Blue Apron recipe was supposed to quote, lend even more savory flavor to my dish. Yum.
POD1000000004_S0000173	There's the tiniest, the tiniest, tiniest portion of brown rice. I mean, this must be maybe half a cup in a bag, maybe three times the size.
POD1000000004_S0000174	I decided that it would be sad to cook these dishes by myself, so I invited my girlfriend over to experience the magic of Blue Apron with me.
POD1000000004_S0000175	You have a choice between meals tonight.
POD1000000004_S0000176	I'm so ready. Mostly because I'm so hungry.
POD1000000004_S0000177	Oh, well. We had the choice of three dishes, but one of them had cilantro sauce, so no thank you. Another was like a spicy Indian situation, and I was feeling kind of basic. So I chose the pesto and kale pasta with goat cheese.
POD1000000004_S0000178	It says this quick cooking pasta gets a one-two punch of irresistible flavor from a dollop of creamy goat cheese for delicious tang and our herbaceous basil pesto stirred into the warm pasta and garlicky kale just before serving.
POD1000000004_S0000179	By the way, that was wrong.
POD1000000004_S0000180	Herbaceous.
POD1000000004_S0000181	A touch of crushed red pepper.
POD1000000004_S0000182	Technically, we picked the easiest dish. So what? Things were going well until I dropped a garlic clove down the insincerator.
POD1000000004_S0000183	Oh, Hannah, no! Get your hand out of the garbage disposal!
POD1000000004_S0000184	After that near catastrophe, we boiled the fresh cavatelli, sauteed the kale with garlic and red pepper flakes, added the pesto and the dollop of goat cheese and voila!
POD1000000004_S0000185	Can I get you a bowl of pasta?
POD1000000004_S0000186	What? Why yes?
POD1000000004_S0000187	You could.
POD1000000004_S0000188	And I'm here to report, we made a damn fine meal. The kale was tender, crisp, and very well seasoned. The cavatelli was perfectly al dente, well done, Hannah. And the cheese added some good saltiness.
POD1000000004_S0000189	I would say we are perfectly satisfied diners. But wait, there's more!
POD1000000004_S0000190	clean up is practically nothing because everything came out of a packet. So really we're only left with
POD1000000004_S0000191	Actually, that's really nice.
POD1000000004_S0000192	A couple of dishes.
POD1000000004_S0000193	I don't want to underestimate that. I think that's really nice.
POD1000000004_S0000194	But not everyone who's used Blue Apron has appreciated that. The company has gotten flack for its abundant packaging, though much of it is now recyclable. And customers have complained that the recipes were too complicated.
POD1000000004_S0000195	I made four blue apron meals for the story, and for a middling cook with a reasonable amount of cookware, I thought the dishes were pretty simple to assemble. Also pretty tasty.
POD1000000004_S0000196	I would make every single one of those dishes again. But I do the shopping myself, which I guess sort of defeats the purpose.
POD1000000004_S0000197	When I opened my first Blue Apron box, it was a novelty. A cornucopia on cardboard. But then I forgot to cancel my subscription and I got a second box by accident.
POD1000000004_S0000198	But that one wasn't as exciting. By then I understood the gimmick, and the excitement of discovery kind of fizzled. In this way, I'm not too different from a lot of people who try Blue Apron, says Professor Dan McCarthy.
POD1000000004_S0000199	Discovery doesn't tend to last that long. There's a bunch of people, they look at Blue Apron as this. It's like, I want kind of this surprise and delight every month.
POD1000000004_S0000200	And the problem is they may want that initially, but after you've been surprised and delighted a few times, you say, you know, I'm pretty good. I don't need any more of this surprise and delight.
POD1000000004_S0000201	But Blue Apron execs were like, uh, yeah you do, you need it, and you want it. And they believed in their product's ability not just to continually delight, but to actually provide a valuable service to people.
POD1000000004_S0000202	And all that meant that, in 2017, the company had to work out its options. Pack it in, sell, or go public.
POD1000000004_S0000203	and the higher-ups decided on going public.
POD1000000004_S0000204	Now, before offering up public stock in the company for the first time, Blue Apron wanted to show strong customer growth. So they started to amp up spending to bring in new users.
POD1000000004_S0000205	Remember CAC, the customer acquisition cost? In the year before the IPO, Blue Apron increased its marketing cash by almost 200%.
POD1000000004_S0000206	But none of this marketing resulted in a huge new customer haul. And that, says Forbes' Alex Conrad, made investors a little less in love with the company.
POD1000000004_S0000207	It was hard to make a really attractive, you know, future-facing story for like how Blue Apron really becomes that huge.
POD1000000004_S0000208	Blue Apron's books weren't the only thing that made investors turn up their noses around the IPO. A couple weeks before the Blue Apron team was set to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Amazon made a little announcement.
POD1000000004_S0000209	It was buying Whole Foods in a $13.7 billion deal. For Blue Apron, it was like getting upstaged at your own wedding by an impossibly rich and infinitely more beautiful guest of a guest.
POD1000000004_S0000210	When Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods was announced, that was just devastating. Even just psychologically, it felt like, you know, here come the giants.
POD1000000004_S0000211	And if Amazon can sell things to you online really well, and Whole Foods has pretty good ingredients, what is Blue Apron really selling here?
POD1000000004_S0000212	And then, of course, Amazon trademarked its own meal kit offering.
POD1000000004_S0000213	Everyone was very concerned that basically this was going to be the next, you know, I won't call Blue Apron an ant, you know, but I would say everyone agree Amazon's way bigger.
POD1000000004_S0000215	They were just going to bowl their way right in and stamp this industry out. And so that was a big lurking concern.
POD1000000004_S0000216	Blue Apron's IPO in the summer of 2017 raised $300 million, about a third of what the company anticipated. Stock went for about $10 a share, rather than the expected $15 to $17.
POD1000000004_S0000217	It was a turbulent IPO, to say the least.
POD1000000004_S0000218	Still, Blue Apron co-founder and CEO Matt Salzberg seemed pretty upbeat about the whole situation on CNBC.
POD1000000004_S0000219	I'm honestly not here to really talk about the pricing of Blue Apron stock. That's really up to the investors to decide. You know Blue Apron is here because we're excited about the big opportunity that we're going after.
POD1000000004_S0000220	We're tackling a huge market and we're focused on the long term quite frankly and the stock price today whether it's up down left or right is really just the beginning of this new chapter in our company's life that we're really excited about.
POD1000000004_S0000222	One thing Salzberg mentioned in that clip was how his company was tackling a huge market. Now, if you're defining the market as all the people who eat food in America, then yeah, that's a huge market.
POD1000000004_S0000223	But according to the good folks at market research company Packaged Facts, that market has a ceiling and not like a cathedral ceiling.
POD1000000004_S0000224	Initially, the market was definitely expanding exponentially. And I think that's where a lot of the interest initially came from. If you're seeing these companies that are having 100% growth, like that's really significant.
POD1000000004_S0000225	That's Cara Rash. She's a food and beverage analyst with Package Facts.
POD1000000004_S0000226	One of the whole things that I think went wrong with the industry is people thought there was a very big addressable market for meal kits, but as it turns out, there really isn't.
POD1000000004_S0000227	It's hard to gauge, but Rash estimates that only about 1% of the U.S. population uses home delivery meal kits. And she says the market kind of peaked two or three years ago.
POD1000000004_S0000228	Since Blue Apron started, more than 150 meal kit services have come on the scene. But only about 15 to 20 are national operations, with HelloFresh now the clear market leader.
POD1000000004_S0000229	Remember when we said Amazon trademarked its meal kit back in 2017? Rash says the company never did much with it. And that's a pretty good indicator that meal kit delivery is not a growing global concern.
POD1000000004_S0000230	I think that Amazon saw that much of the market for meal kits had already been addressed by the competitors that were already there. So they didn't try really to break into that because they didn't see much potential for growth anymore.
POD1000000004_S0000231	It seems like Amazon was right to hold off. In 2017, Blue Apron hemorrhaged 250,000 customers. And its stock price had tanked to just $2.99 a share by the end of the year.
POD1000000004_S0000232	And there were more problems. Within a month of the IPO, co-founder Matt Wadiak stepped down as COO. Matt Salzberg, then the CEO, resigned his post shortly thereafter.
POD1000000004_S0000233	Blue Apron's expensive, brand-spanking-new fulfillment center in New Jersey had a bunch of tech bugs that needed to be worked out. And workers from its California operation filed a class-action lawsuit over alleged missing wages.
POD1000000004_S0000234	Things were looking pretty grim for the once-hyped company.
POD1000000004_S0000235	Welcome to trading nation. I'm Eric Chumney. Let's take a look at one of last year's high profile IPOs that's getting absolutely smoked. We're talking of course about blue apron. The stock sinking as much as 4% on Friday.
POD1000000004_S0000236	By the end of 2018, Blue Apron stock dipped below a dollar a share. And the slide didn't seem to be letting up.
POD1000000004_S0000237	The following summer, the company tried to move meant to keep it from being booted from the stock exchange. It's called a reverse stock split.
POD1000000004_S0000238	split, and basically it means that the company bundled its shares. So you get a fewer total number of shares, but each share is worth more, like trading in four quarters for a dollar.
POD1000000004_S0000239	The move raised the company's stock price, but customers still weren't flocking to Blue Apron's boxes. Now, at this point, I would have thrown in the towel. But non-CEO Linda Finlay-Kuzlowski,
POD1000000004_S0000240	The company wouldn't make Kozlowski available for a chat, but here she is last year on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, talking about how jazzed she is about Blue Apron's prospects.
POD1000000004_S0000241	and our recipes, our ingredients, our culinary authority, our brand recognition is by far still number one. So we feel confident that when we're talking to investors, they appreciate and understand that there's something here. It's really just about getting execution right and making sure that we're actually
POD1000000004_S0000242	capital. Cool, cool, cool. But also Blue Apron was thinking about getting down with some strategic alternatives, says Market Watch's Tanya Garcia.
POD1000000004_S0000243	strategic alternatives, which, you know, means a lot and nothing at the same time, right?
POD1000000004_S0000244	It's like saying, I'm totally happy being single, but I'd be into dating if the right person came along.
POD1000000004_S0000245	It's kind of like one of those things that companies will say when they're just like, well, we'd be open to, you know, getting bought or a partnership if you're interested, you know, kind of a thing.
POD1000000004_S0000246	In early 2020, Blue Apron put the word out that it was interested in possibly getting scooped up, maybe by a big grocery chain or someone else with deep pockets who wanted to own a meal kit delivery business.
POD1000000004_S0000247	At the same time, Garcia says, the company acted like it was in turnaround mode. It decided to streamline operations, including shutting down its fulfillment center in Texas.
POD1000000004_S0000248	It also did away with trying to shovel everyone who had ever eaten food into the top of its customer funnel.
POD1000000004_S0000249	they've decided to focus on what they call their core customers. And these are people who aren't going to do like a lot of people and use a coupon and, you know, get Blue Apron for a month and then cancel their subscription.
POD1000000004_S0000250	So at the same time Blue Apron was looking to sell, it was also doubling down on its mission. These were last gasp efforts. It wanted to save itself.
POD1000000004_S0000251	And then came the most unlikely lifeline anyone could think of, a global pandemic. A highly contagious virus that required those of us without essential jobs to practically never leave our houses.
POD1000000004_S0000252	online grocery delivery shot through the roof. And suddenly everyone remembered about this company they heard about on a podcast ad three years ago.
POD1000000004_S0000253	The pandemic has been actually a bit of a good thing for them because it has raised demand.
POD1000000004_S0000254	Blue Apron sees a lot of potential in what the company is offering, especially given that more Americans seem to be interested in cooking at home. Thanks, Corona.
POD1000000004_S0000255	If you're Blue Apron, then you're probably thinking, you know, well, if we do a good job, some of this will stick.
POD1000000004_S0000256	In the first quarter of 2020, when coronavirus brought America to a standstill, Blue Apron customer orders were up a bit, though they didn't spike like the markets hoped. The company still lost $20 million. But that was a little better than the previous quarter.
POD1000000004_S0000257	On its first quarter earnings call of 2020, the company's CEO and CFO shook their pom-poms like they were on an episode of Cheer, but like the version that features slightly wooden corporate executives.
POD1000000004_S0000258	So I think the combination of those things puts us in a good position going forward. And we can't specifically guide to what's going to happen in the second half of the year because of all the uncertainties.
POD1000000004_S0000259	We do believe that there will continue to be some positive effects as we move out of Q2.
POD1000000004_S0000260	The pandemic seems like it's given Blue Apron a decent little boost. In the second quarter, the company brought in 20,000 more subscribers. But that's still way below where they were in 2019.
POD1000000004_S0000261	It's anyone's guess whether Blue Apron specifically and meal kit delivery more generally are here to stay. The business Kiki Tjander founded in Sweden 13 years ago is still delivering weekly meal fix-ins to busy Swedes.
POD1000000004_S0000262	And despite its own turbulence, market leader HelloFresh is still cranking out boxes. And there's no shortage of small meal kit companies looking to fill paleo or vegan or regional cuisine niches.
POD1000000004_S0000263	No one knows what the true impact of a global pandemic will be on how we eat and where and when. Not yet anyway. Grocery delivery seems like it's here to stay.
POD1000000004_S0000264	Maybe high-end restaurant takeout will also stick around in some form. It's hard to tell whether all those people who took up home cooking out of necessity will continue to bake crusty sourdough and whip up elaborate curries when we can all safely frequent our favorite local spots.
POD1000000004_S0000265	Blue Apron is banking on a sea change in how Americans eat. The company that was shopping for a buyer just a month before the pandemic hit is now trying to turn a cataclysmic global event into a business-saving opportunity.
POD1000000004_S0000266	One big blue box of food at a time.

POD1000000010_S0000001	In this episode, how to raise kind kids. And to truly understand kindness, Anya and I visited a mother who's lived through every parent's worst nightmare.
POD1000000010_S0000002	And it changed the whole focus of her life.
POD1000000010_S0000003	There are only two kinds of people in the world, good people and good people in pain.
POD1000000010_S0000004	Her name is Scarlett Lewis, and before we met her, Corey, I have to confess that I wasn't necessarily all that impressed with kindness as an idea. I mean,
POD1000000010_S0000005	You're a kindness skeptic.
POD1000000010_S0000006	Well, I don't want to say skeptic, but just let's say that kindness is like a slogan that's on a pillow that I would never have on my couch.
POD1000000010_S0000007	But that really, really changed for me when we traveled to rural Connecticut to spend some time with Scarlet.
POD1000000010_S0000009	I've lived on this farm for 20 years before the two boys and it's really my dream place.
POD1000000010_S0000010	Scarlett named this place Wild Rose Farm. There are a few chickens clucking in a wire coop behind a muddy pasture where there's also a horse.
POD1000000010_S0000011	This is one of the oldest barns in Fairfield County.
POD1000000010_S0000012	Really?
POD1000000010_S0000013	Yeah, the house is 1740, so older than the United States of America.
POD1000000010_S0000014	We get there in time to watch her feed the animals, including her constant companions, three dogs, Remington, Rocky, and Olive.
POD1000000010_S0000015	And he's hungry too.
POD1000000010_S0000016	I think he thought that the mic was a dog. Watch out!
POD1000000010_S0000017	So Scarlett leaves us inside the house and I remember we took our jackets off in the mudroom and hanging there was a first graders black and blue ski jacket.
POD1000000010_S0000018	And Scarlett stopped and she pulled out a pair of these funny looking teeth out of the pocket, joke teeth.
POD1000000010_S0000019	I always say that he wore these little teeth because he was such a goofball to school every day.
POD1000000010_S0000020	Oh my. Little silver teeth.
POD1000000010_S0000021	Yeah.
POD1000000010_S0000022	Um...
POD1000000010_S0000023	Scarlett's son, Jesse, had these teeth in this coat at Sandy Hook Elementary School the day he died.
POD1000000010_S0000024	My name's Scarlett Lewis and I'm the founder of the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement.
POD1000000010_S0000025	And I founded this organization following the murder of my six-year-old son alongside 19 of his classmates and six educators in one of the worst mass murders in US history.
POD1000000010_S0000026	Here in Sandy Hook, Connecticut in 2012, Scarlett lived through every parent's nightmare.
POD1000000010_S0000027	And following that I realized that there isn't a they out there.
POD1000000010_S0000028	And by they, she means someone else who's going to come into our schools and our homes and help kids replace their anger and violence with warmth and compassion.
POD1000000010_S0000029	Right then we come into the sunny kitchen, which is painted turquoise and bright yellow.
POD1000000010_S0000030	Every surface is covered with painting scarlets done and photos of Jesse and his brother JT.
POD1000000010_S0000031	and one of the cabinets has chalkboard paint on it. And on it is a message from Jesse.
POD1000000010_S0000032	We hardly ever use this is spray-painted chalkboard.
POD1000000010_S0000033	Scarlett didn't notice this message until she returned to the house several days after the shooting to find clothes for Jesse to wear in his casket.
POD1000000010_S0000034	She walked in and froze.
POD1000000010_S0000035	I saw that nurturing, healing love and I couldn't believe it.
POD1000000010_S0000036	Nurturing, healing, love. You can see those three words. They're spelled phonetically in a six-year-old's jagged scrawl.
POD1000000010_S0000037	I thought I would never be able to come back here. I don't know why I'm crying because usually I don't. Sorry.
POD1000000010_S0000038	I'm usually really good at keeping it together. Give me a moment.
POD1000000010_S0000040	Scarlet says she has no idea how or where her little boy came up with those three words.
POD1000000010_S0000041	But the moment she saw them, she realized.
POD1000000010_S0000042	This is my life now. I knew I would be spending the rest of my life spreading this message.
POD1000000010_S0000043	And by the way, six years later, you can tell what a moment it was because it's all I talk about. It's all I do.
POD1000000010_S0000044	It is the focus of my life. Every waking moment, every breath, every word that comes out of my mouth is about nurturing, healing, love, really.

POD1000000010_S0000059	So Corey, yes, kindness is important, but I guess I always just assumed that my kids would learn it naturally through osmosis.
POD1000000010_S0000060	just if you love them, they'll become kind.
POD1000000010_S0000061	Well, you know what, Anya? You are not alone in that assumption.
POD1000000010_S0000062	We often just expect people to be kind without talking about it.
POD1000000010_S0000063	We think, oh, you're a good kid, you're going to be kind.
POD1000000010_S0000064	That is Jennifer Kotler. She's one of our expert guides today through what turns out to be a pretty complicated subject.
POD1000000010_S0000065	Kindness has been a part of Sesame Street from the beginning, so it's not a new concept, but
POD1000000010_S0000066	But, she says, the folks at Sesame and lots of child development experts are starting to notice things. Warnings.
POD1000000010_S0000067	not only in the headlines, but in research.
POD1000000010_S0000068	And that brings us to our first takeaway, that parents and teachers are sending kids really mixed messages about kindness.
POD1000000010_S0000069	Exhibit A is this study Jen points to out of Harvard a few years back.
POD1000000010_S0000070	Middle school children, for example, thought that their parents valued academic success over kindness.
POD1000000010_S0000071	In fact, about 80% of children believed their parents were more concerned about good grades and their kids' careers than whether they were caring towards others.
POD1000000010_S0000072	80% and the parents on the other hand they got surveyed too
POD1000000010_S0000073	And they didn't realize this. They were totally wrong about the message that they thought their kids were getting.
POD1000000010_S0000074	Yeah, and this kind of like self-delusion, this is just one of many reasons Scarlett worries that this culture is creating huge problems.
POD1000000010_S0000075	Now at epidemic levels.
POD1000000010_S0000076	And I'm not talking about just school violence and bullying and loneliness, but also substance abuse and mental illness.
POD1000000010_S0000077	And of course her life is a really stark reminder, Corey, of just how high the stakes can be when we talk about things like mental health and kids who are troubled.
POD1000000010_S0000078	Sometimes it's frustrating for me because we act like we don't know what to do.
POD1000000010_S0000079	And we do know what to do.
POD1000000010_S0000080	After she read that message from Jesse, Scarlett Lewis reached out to a team of researchers and educators and she created a plan to essentially teach children kindness step by step, value by value.
POD1000000010_S0000081	Yeah, the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Enrichment Program. They estimate it's now reached over a million students.
POD1000000010_S0000082	In fact, in the past decade or so, schools all over the country have woken up to the idea that they have a responsibility to teach kids how to treat each other.
POD1000000010_S0000083	Yeah, and not just to prevent the next tragedy, but also because research tells us that these non-academic skills, often called social and emotional skills,
POD1000000010_S0000084	they make up about half of the equation that determines whether kids are going to be successful in their lives.
POD1000000010_S0000085	So let's follow Scarlett's lead and Sesame Street's and talk about how the science of kindness can translate into action.
POD1000000010_S0000087	Takeaway number two.
POD1000000010_S0000088	Kids are born to be kind.
POD1000000010_S0000089	but also unkind.
POD1000000010_S0000090	Here's what we mean.
POD1000000010_S0000091	So on the one hand, people have neurons in our brains called mirror neurons, and they respond in the same way when we experience pain, like we're pricked by a needle, as we do when we watch someone else experience pain.
POD1000000010_S0000092	It's a mirror.
POD1000000010_S0000093	It lights up the same receptors in our brain as physical pain.
POD1000000010_S0000094	Soon after birth, children, for example, will be more likely to cry as a result of hearing another child cry than they are in response to any other sort of noise.
POD1000000010_S0000095	Thomas Lacona says we see signs of what is called empathic distress, even in tiny babies.
POD1000000010_S0000096	He's a psychologist who wrote the book on how to raise kind kids. Literally.
POD1000000010_S0000097	That's what it's called. He's also been a family counselor, has two kids, and 15 grandkids.
POD1000000010_S0000098	And Tom told us that Baby's moral sense seems to go even deeper.
POD1000000010_S0000099	Studies going back to the late 1990s have found infants as young as three months old prefer a kind or helper puppet over a mean, aggressive character.
POD1000000010_S0000100	So this is like I was saying, Cory, I always thought kids are just born to be kind.
POD1000000010_S0000101	Yeah, but the problem for kids is that there are also a lot of barriers to kindness.
POD1000000010_S0000102	For example, there's a small study of two-year-olds who were exposed to another child's distress. Say a friend fell down on the playground.
POD1000000010_S0000103	Only about a third of the kids actually responded in that moment with altruism, with kindness, by, say, going over to the child, offering a hug, calling for an adult.
POD1000000010_S0000104	Zachary!
POD1000000010_S0000106	Let's check on her Bella. He's trying to check on you.
POD1000000010_S0000107	He's trying to help you up.
POD1000000010_S0000108	Yeah, and we actually saw this kind of scene in person on a recent trip that we took to a preschool on the campus of Eastern Connecticut State University.
POD1000000010_S0000109	I got a little feather.
POD1000000010_S0000110	Oh great, let's see.
POD1000000010_S0000111	What a kind friend!
POD1000000010_S0000112	Mommy, help me up there!
POD1000000010_S0000114	And it really got me wondering, would my kids be that one in three? Would yours?
POD1000000010_S0000115	Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I really hope so.
POD1000000010_S0000116	But what is it that gets in the way of that kindness, that act of kindness in the moment?
POD1000000010_S0000117	A bunch of things.
POD1000000010_S0000118	Young kids are naturally self-centered.
POD1000000010_S0000119	sure.
POD1000000010_S0000120	Every parent knows that.
POD1000000010_S0000121	So they might just be oblivious to another child's pain.
POD1000000010_S0000122	You know, and there's also individual temperament, right?
POD1000000010_S0000123	So some kids
POD1000000010_S0000124	They really can't handle other kids' pain. They shut down.
POD1000000010_S0000125	Or maybe they're really shy and they're waiting for someone else to step up.
POD1000000010_S0000126	You know, decades of psychology research tells us this is a grown-up problem too.
POD1000000010_S0000127	Sometimes the presence of others automatically serves as an inhibition.
POD1000000010_S0000128	But there's also another more disturbing barrier to kindness that adults really need to understand here, and it's prejudice.
POD1000000010_S0000129	So there's another Yale study of six to eight month old babies.
POD1000000010_S0000130	Mm-hmm.
POD1000000010_S0000131	and they wanted a puppet that did not share their snack preference, punished.
POD1000000010_S0000132	Punished?
POD1000000010_S0000133	Yeah, so it's not just that these babies showed a preference for those who look or behave or think like they do, but also a kind of hostility to those that don't.
POD1000000010_S0000134	Wow.
POD1000000010_S0000135	Yeah, so for all these reasons, children and grown-ups alike don't always reach out to help.
POD1000000010_S0000136	Instead, we often do the opposite.
POD1000000010_S0000137	It's true. We hide from other people's pay and we run away from responsibility.
POD1000000010_S0000138	And that's why Scarlet says.
POD1000000010_S0000139	You don't really need the skills and tools.
POD1000000010_S0000140	What you need is the courage to be with somebody in pain and just be present.
POD1000000010_S0000142	And that's our third takeaway.
POD1000000010_S0000143	Kindness requires courage.
POD1000000010_S0000144	The Jesse Lewis Choose Love program for kids from pre-K through high school actually begins with courage.
POD1000000010_S0000145	And I want to mention that reports of the shooting said that Jesse himself showed incredible courage.
POD1000000010_S0000146	When the shooter stopped to reload, he yelled, run. And the investigator said that he saved many of his classmates lives in that moment.
POD1000000010_S0000147	Yeah, and Scarlet's definition of courage is even bigger than that sort of
POD1000000010_S0000149	courage.
POD1000000010_S0000151	heroic courage.
POD1000000010_S0000152	For her, it includes the courage to reach out to a hurting friend on the playground, or a child you don't even know.
POD1000000010_S0000153	Yeah, absolutely. I mean the courage to offer comfort to someone who's lost a loved one even if the idea of death is really scary to you.
POD1000000010_S0000154	It's also, Scarlett says, the courage to stand up to someone who's bullying you or someone you know by taking their perspective and seeing the world through their eyes.
POD1000000010_S0000155	Gosh, you know, what would make you act that way?
POD1000000010_S0000156	What's going on in your life?
POD1000000010_S0000157	I feel compassion for you.
POD1000000010_S0000158	I see the pain.
POD1000000010_S0000159	Is there anything that I can do to help ease that pain?
POD1000000010_S0000160	You know, hearing about courage in that way in that moment really spoke to me, Corey, because I have to admit this.
POD1000000010_S0000161	I was a little afraid to sit down with Scarlett.
POD1000000010_S0000162	I mean, someone who had gone through something that I as a parent fear so much and to look that pain in the face.
POD1000000010_S0000163	But the way that she has transformed that experience into a positive legacy is so inspiring.
POD1000000010_S0000165	One really practical way Scarlett's Choose Love plan builds courage is by teaching kids to stay calm.
POD1000000010_S0000166	They practice brave poses and brave breaths to stand up tall like superheroes and calm down their bodies and their minds.
POD1000000010_S0000167	Yeah, there are a few different reasons for this which make up our fourth takeaway.
POD1000000010_S0000168	Takeaway number four.
POD1000000010_S0000169	Kindness takes mindfulness.
POD1000000010_S0000170	Jen Kotler at Sesame says,
POD1000000010_S0000171	and you'll be less likely to lash out violently in frustration or anger.
POD1000000010_S0000172	Self-regulation is something we all struggle with.
POD1000000010_S0000173	And that's why mindfulness is so important and really learning how to manage our own emotions.
POD1000000010_S0000174	And I think the earlier that we can practice those skills, the better we'll be in adulthood.
POD1000000010_S0000175	In fact, the folks at Sesame are so convinced of the connection between mindfulness and kindness that they like to use a special word, kindfulness.
POD1000000010_S0000176	You hear that Miriam Webster?
POD1000000010_S0000178	Anyway, lots of these social and emotional learning programs introduce tools like meditation, relaxation, yoga, to help kids work on this body-mind connection.
POD1000000010_S0000179	So we talked about the courage that it takes to step in when someone else is hurting, even if that person is being hurtful towards you.
POD1000000010_S0000180	and how to cultivate that quiet in your mind that lets you do that.
POD1000000010_S0000181	Our next takeaway is about what to do when your child hurts someone else, accidentally or intentionally.
POD1000000010_S0000182	Or, on the other hand, when someone else hurts your child.
POD1000000010_S0000183	Takeaway number five.
POD1000000010_S0000184	Apologies are a skill.
POD1000000010_S0000185	And forgiveness is a gift you give yourself.
POD1000000010_S0000186	Yeah, before Jen started at Sesame Workshop. She spent her days in a classroom.
POD1000000010_S0000187	I remember when I was a preschool teacher briefly that we were told we don't force children to apologize to each other.
POD1000000010_S0000188	And I remember in my early 20s thinking, that's absurd.
POD1000000010_S0000189	You should totally tell children to apologize to each other.
POD1000000010_S0000190	The problem Jen found out with forced apologies is that they're usually pretty worthless.
POD1000000010_S0000191	Sorry.
POD1000000010_S0000192	They don't even realize that they're supposed to mean it or feel it.
POD1000000010_S0000193	Yeah, so Tom Lacona and Jen Cutler both told us, instead of focusing on kids, parenting the words, sorry,
POD1000000010_S0000194	we should help them really take the other person's perspective. And, this is important, repair the harm done.
POD1000000010_S0000195	Yeah, and this is a great tip.
POD1000000010_S0000196	Jen says you can actually take a moment like this.
POD1000000010_S0000197	and direct one child to look at the other child's face and posture.
POD1000000010_S0000198	And this helps them learn how to read feelings.
POD1000000010_S0000199	So it's really about more conversations and about looking at emotions and emotion knowledge and looking at faces to see how your actions affect other people.
POD1000000010_S0000200	Jen says Sesame Street has improved over time in how it depicts apologies on the show,
POD1000000010_S0000201	It now has characters discuss what went wrong and why and how to make it better.
POD1000000010_S0000202	So Elmo might say, I was really wanting to play with my scooter and I didn't want to share it.
POD1000000010_S0000203	and I realized that you probably wanted a turn too.
POD1000000010_S0000204	and I should let you have the time with it.
POD1000000010_S0000206	You'll get it, Zoe.
POD1000000010_S0000207	But wait, what about your turn Elmo?
POD1000000010_S0000208	Elmo can be patient and wait for his turn.
POD1000000010_S0000209	So what do you say, Zoe?
POD1000000010_S0000210	And then the other character would say, yes, that's how I was feeling that you weren't sharing.
POD1000000010_S0000211	and it was hurting my feelings and then when you shared it made me feel better.
POD1000000010_S0000212	HAHAHA
POD1000000010_S0000214	Nice job sharing, Ola.
POD1000000010_S0000215	Oh, my dicks!
POD1000000010_S0000216	So in that interaction, you're giving children a lot of language to describe how they're feeling.
POD1000000010_S0000217	That may be a lot to expect from a two-year-old.
POD1000000010_S0000218	But, you know, apologies are a skill, kind of like learning to scooter.
POD1000000010_S0000219	and they improve with practice.
POD1000000010_S0000220	Yeah, and starting these kinds of conversations early is crucial to raising a child who runs to help when somebody's hurt.
POD1000000010_S0000221	So remember that small study we mentioned of kids on the playground?
POD1000000010_S0000222	Well, it also looked in-depth at the parenting styles of their mothers in different situations.
POD1000000010_S0000223	When one child hurt another, many of the mothers responded with something casual and bland.
POD1000000010_S0000224	Yeah, like, oh, don't do that.
POD1000000010_S0000225	But the researchers found that the moms of the helper kids, those 1 and 3 who ran to help, they were different.
POD1000000010_S0000226	Yeah, they were warm and nurturing, but they also took it really seriously when their child hurt another child.
POD1000000010_S0000227	So they'd say something like...
POD1000000010_S0000228	You hurt Amy.
POD1000000010_S0000229	Pulling hair hurts. Never pull hair.
POD1000000010_S0000230	And as a result, the child was more likely to take it seriously later on and respond compassionately when she saw another child crying on the playground.
POD1000000010_S0000231	Tom also says that children should learn to make an apology of action.
POD1000000010_S0000232	what we grown-ups might call restitution. If you break something, you fix it, whether it's a broken toy or a hurt feeling.
POD1000000010_S0000233	This is also where things get hard for us grown-ups too.
POD1000000010_S0000234	Yeah.
POD1000000010_S0000235	because all the experts we spoke with were really clear. Kids do what they see.
POD1000000010_S0000236	And Scarlett Lewis says that means when parents screw up, we need to apologize too.
POD1000000010_S0000237	Wow, mom made a mistake, you know.
POD1000000010_S0000238	and I misinterpreted what just happened here.
POD1000000010_S0000239	and I got angry. I'm sorry. You know, can you guys forgive me?
POD1000000010_S0000240	If anything, Scarlett talks even more about the other side of an apology, forgiveness.
POD1000000010_S0000241	That's one of the four core values of her Choose Love program, along with courage.
POD1000000010_S0000242	She says when she first pitched the program, people weren't sure about forgiveness.
POD1000000010_S0000243	That's a very lofty topic for kids.
POD1000000010_S0000244	Don't you think that's a little too complicated?
POD1000000010_S0000245	Not at all, she says.
POD1000000010_S0000246	the Choose Love classrooms have turned forgiveness into a hands-on exercise.
POD1000000010_S0000247	We literally take string and scissors and we cut the cord because that's how I talk about it.
POD1000000010_S0000248	Like if you're angry at somebody, you're attached to them with an umbilical cord.
POD1000000010_S0000249	and it runs out of your side into the side of the person that you're angry at.
POD1000000010_S0000250	I love this too because Scarlet is really focusing on the benefit of letting go of anger.
POD1000000010_S0000251	And she says, you know, holding onto anger, it can be as bad for your health as smoking cigarettes.
POD1000000010_S0000252	And it was at this point, we're sitting with Scarlett in her kitchen, her back is to her refrigerator, which is covered with photos of Jessie and her other son, JT. And we just had to ask,
POD1000000010_S0000253	we've been talking about forgiveness.
POD1000000010_S0000254	Did she forgive the person who murdered her son?
POD1000000010_S0000255	Absolutely.
POD1000000010_S0000257	Without hesitation. Yeah, I without hesitation. I absolutely forgive him.
POD1000000010_S0000259	So we've been talking about kindness in the darkest hours, those moments of conflict,
POD1000000010_S0000260	loss and pain, hurt and anger.
POD1000000010_S0000261	And those are really important.
POD1000000010_S0000262	I mean, that's when you really need kindness.
POD1000000010_S0000263	Yeah, but how do you build kindness up?
POD1000000010_S0000264	Well, if you want to really grow kind people, there's a lot you can do when things are good. When you are full of joy.
POD1000000010_S0000265	That's our takeaway number six, kindness grows with sunlight.
POD1000000010_S0000266	What do we mean by that?
POD1000000010_S0000267	You have to raise the capital of kindness.
POD1000000010_S0000268	Aja Simmons helps run the social and emotional programs for schools in Oakland, California.
POD1000000010_S0000269	And she focused a lot on kindness when she taught elementary school.
POD1000000010_S0000270	You have to point it out.
POD1000000010_S0000271	You have to name it.
POD1000000010_S0000272	You have to appreciate it when you see it.
POD1000000010_S0000273	For example, every day she'd hold circle time.
POD1000000010_S0000274	And a lot of times she'd ask this.
POD1000000010_S0000275	You know, what were some ways this week where your classmates were kind to you?
POD1000000010_S0000276	Turn and share a moment where you felt someone was being really kind.
POD1000000010_S0000277	Tom Lacona says it's not just about celebrating kind actions.
POD1000000010_S0000278	It's encouraging kids to identify as kind people.
POD1000000010_S0000279	Yeah, because people are more likely to be kind if they see it as part of who they are.
POD1000000010_S0000280	Yeah, this idea of taking special notice when people are kind to you? Well, another word for that could be gratitude.
POD1000000010_S0000281	Yeah, part of how Scarlet keeps going, she told us, is by constantly reminding herself, even out loud, what she's grateful for.
POD1000000010_S0000282	My gratitude lists are all day long.
POD1000000010_S0000283	And I start in the morning by taking off up the sun's out and up. I can get up out of bed and literally like I'm taking them off all day.
POD1000000010_S0000284	And when you're focused on gratitude, you're not focused on the lesser energy thoughts.
POD1000000010_S0000285	And Tom agrees.
POD1000000010_S0000286	There's a payoff to practicing gratitude in this way.
POD1000000010_S0000287	Not only can it raise the stock of kindness in your family, in your classroom, but research shows that people who are thankful are also happier.
POD1000000010_S0000288	Yeah, he suggests that at meal times, for example, families go around and mention their gratefuls, things that they're thankful for that day.
POD1000000010_S0000289	Yeah, we do this in my house.
POD1000000010_S0000291	Alright, who wants to go first?
POD1000000010_S0000292	Me. I'm thankful for animals and pandas.
POD1000000010_S0000293	Thank you for this food and this day and that my concerts today.
POD1000000010_S0000294	It's not always easy.
POD1000000010_S0000295	Sometimes my guys don't really want to do it. They just want to eat.
POD1000000010_S0000296	Thank you for um this breakfast um
POD1000000010_S0000297	I can't stand it.
POD1000000010_S0000298	But we do it.
POD1000000010_S0000299	The point of all this is to really carve out a time in each day for your kids and you to acknowledge, you know, we're not self-sufficient.
POD1000000010_S0000300	We're not islands.
POD1000000010_S0000301	We need other people and other people need us.
POD1000000010_S0000302	That's a great point, Cory. I've got to try it out.
POD1000000010_S0000304	We've come to our final takeaway, takeaway number seven, kindness requires
POD1000000010_S0000305	Practice, practice, practice.
POD1000000010_S0000306	Yeah, in fact, Scarlett Lewis says...
POD1000000010_S0000307	We were going to change the name of our program from Choose Love Enrichment Program to Choose Love Enrichment Practice.
POD1000000010_S0000308	And similarly, Tom says, kindness as a virtue isn't random. It's a habit.
POD1000000010_S0000309	And that's not just calling out kindness when you see it in your kids.
POD1000000010_S0000310	It's giving them lots of opportunities to be kind.
POD1000000010_S0000311	and you can start with chores at home.
POD1000000010_S0000312	Chores, yeah, that's a really good idea.
POD1000000010_S0000313	So Tom says, you know, not for an allowance, but just to give the message that this is what we do to help out because we're part of something bigger.
POD1000000010_S0000314	And for my daughter Lulu, who's seven, that chore really is taking care of the cat.
POD1000000010_S0000315	You know, we got the cat, she promised that she would help out not only with the feeding, but also the litter box.
POD1000000010_S0000316	This is really giving her the message that there's another creature depending on her.
POD1000000010_S0000317	Yeah, totally.
POD1000000010_S0000318	And you can also, and should, you know, take this model, this idea, and take it out into your community.
POD1000000010_S0000319	Have your kids help pick up trash in the neighborhood or help folks at a shelter
POD1000000010_S0000320	raise money for a good cause, whatever it is.
POD1000000010_S0000322	And here's the really good news, Tom told us.
POD1000000010_S0000323	Getting our kids to be helpers, to be in service, it doesn't just benefit the grown-ups that they become.
POD1000000010_S0000324	Doing this regularly actually feels good chemically.
POD1000000010_S0000325	It's what brain researchers call Helper's High.
POD1000000010_S0000326	Doing a kind act lights up a part of the brain that lets us experience joy.
POD1000000010_S0000327	And that's why he says we're happier when we're helping. And Janet Sesame agrees.
POD1000000010_S0000328	Kindness really does make you feel good.
POD1000000010_S0000329	And that's why Scarlett says we should talk to kids directly about this helper's high.
POD1000000010_S0000330	There's so much science that shows, and I say all the nurturing, healing love that you give out, you get back.
POD1000000010_S0000331	So this is getting me thinking more about that study of middle school students that we opened the episode with.
POD1000000010_S0000332	Mmm.
POD1000000010_S0000333	You know, our kids, they hear from us every day. Do your homework.
POD1000000010_S0000334	study for the test.
POD1000000010_S0000335	how well did you do?
POD1000000010_S0000336	And they hear us talk about sweating some promotion or working hard on a project.
POD1000000010_S0000337	But, you know, do we ever stop and ask them, were you kind in class today?
POD1000000010_S0000338	Yeah, did you help somebody who is hurting or sit by that kid who always eats alone?
POD1000000010_S0000339	It's no wonder our kids so often think that we value grades more than kindness.
POD1000000010_S0000340	So I'm thinking more about how to raise the capital of kindness at home.
POD1000000010_S0000341	and we've gone through these great strategies, right?
POD1000000010_S0000342	Yeah, yeah. I mean, the goal here, everyone we talked to said this word.
POD1000000010_S0000343	They use the word culture.
POD1000000010_S0000344	You have to create a culture of kindness, whether you're talking about home or the classroom or anywhere.
POD1000000010_S0000346	Time for a recap, Anya.
POD1000000010_S0000347	Alright, I'm feeling the love. Let's do it.
POD1000000010_S0000348	Alright.
POD1000000010_S0000349	Here we go, takeaway number one.
POD1000000010_S0000350	We grown-ups need to stop sending our kids mixed messages about kindness.
POD1000000010_S0000351	Yeah, we say we want our kids to be kind, but we have got to walk the walk.
POD1000000010_S0000352	Takeaway number two, kids are born to be kind, but also unkind.
POD1000000010_S0000353	Yes, so empathy is part of what makes us human, but, and this is a big but,
POD1000000010_S0000354	There's a difference between feeling someone else's pain and actually acting to help.
POD1000000010_S0000355	Yeah, kindness is not just a feeling, it's an action.
POD1000000010_S0000356	And that's why our takeaway number three is kindness requires courage.
POD1000000010_S0000357	The courage to embrace other people's pain, the courage to put other people's needs before your own.
POD1000000010_S0000358	but also courage to see someone who's hurt you or a friend or someone in your family not as a bully.
POD1000000010_S0000359	but as someone who's struggling.
POD1000000010_S0000360	the kind of courage to see the world the way Scarlett Lewis does.
POD1000000010_S0000361	There are only two kinds of people in the world, good people and good people in pain.
POD1000000010_S0000362	Takeaway number four, to build kindness, practice mindfulness.
POD1000000010_S0000363	Being able to stay calm and patient will help you every time.
POD1000000010_S0000364	Especially when someone hurts you.
POD1000000010_S0000365	So takeaway number five is apologies are a skill and forgiveness is a gift you give yourself.
POD1000000010_S0000366	Remember, parents and teachers alike, the old sing-songy, sorry, it's not good enough.
POD1000000010_S0000367	And when you're on the other side of the harm, forgiveness may feel hard, but it will also feel good in the long run.
POD1000000010_S0000368	Speaking of feeling good, our takeaway number six is kindness grows with sunlight.
POD1000000010_S0000369	Or as Jen at Sesame says,
POD1000000010_S0000370	We often are quick to tell children when they're doing something wrong and trying to correct them from doing something wrong.
POD1000000010_S0000371	Instead, can we spend more time catching them doing something right, catching them doing something kind?
POD1000000010_S0000372	So create a culture of kindness and gratitude, recognition of kindness, in your home and in your classroom.
POD1000000010_S0000373	And takeaway number six, kindness takes practice.
POD1000000010_S0000374	And grown-ups can help with that by creating opportunities for your kids to be kind.
POD1000000010_S0000375	Whether that's chores at home or family service projects out in the community.
POD1000000010_S0000377	And that's all for this episode of Life Kit for Parenting with Sesame Workshop.
POD1000000010_S0000378	And Anya, it's time for our gratefuls.
POD1000000010_S0000379	I'm ready.

POD1000000010_S0000394	This time, I can't believe I'm about to say this.
POD1000000010_S0000395	from my all-time favorite Muppet as a kid, Grover.
POD1000000010_S0000396	Hello there, life kit! It is I, your cute and adorable pal Grover!
POD1000000010_S0000397	I wear lots of hats on Sesame Street, so I know a thing or two about tips.
POD1000000010_S0000398	In all my years as a waiter at Charlie's Restaurant, I actually never got tips.
POD1000000010_S0000399	Oh, well, when I worked as a bellhop, I... Oh, no, come to think of it, I never got any tips then, either.
POD1000000010_S0000400	Maybe I'm not such an expert on this topic after all.
POD1000000010_S0000401	But I will tell you my little secret for staying positive.
POD1000000010_S0000402	It is the best tip of all. Love the fur you're in. Mm-hmm.

POD1000000014_S0000001	Hello everyone and welcome to Radio Ombudsman in lockdown. Although the sun is shining outside my sturdy window.
POD1000000014_S0000002	Our guest today is the first guest who carries the title President in his name and that is Peter Tindall who is the World President of the International Ombudsman Institute.
POD1000000014_S0000003	And the introductory music today has been composed, produced and played by Rhys Hamilton, a talented young musician from North London.
POD1000000014_S0000004	Thank you, Rhys. I'd welcome feedback on our introductory music.
POD1000000014_S0000005	and if any listener wants to use Radio Ombudsman as a showcase for their musical talent, please let us know.
POD1000000014_S0000006	Peter Tyndall is a big beast of the ombudsman world. He's a Dubliner.
POD1000000014_S0000007	He's now Ombudsman for Ireland, having recently been reappointed to serve a second term.
POD1000000014_S0000008	He has a long association with Wales where he occupied a variety of senior positions in housing and social care.
POD1000000014_S0000009	He then became Public Service Ombudsman for Wales between 2008 and 2013.
POD1000000014_S0000010	He's been chairman of the British and Irish Ombudsman Association for two years and currently he's the president of the World Board of the International Ombudsman Institute for the last four years.
POD1000000014_S0000011	Peter, you're extremely welcome. Thank you for being with us.
POD1000000014_S0000012	Thank you Rob, very glad to be here.
POD1000000014_S0000013	Peter, I'm very interested to hear a bit about your early life.
POD1000000014_S0000014	Where were you born and tell us a bit about the values that were instilled in you when you grew up?
POD1000000014_S0000015	Thank you Rob. I was born in Dublin, I was born into a fairly ordinary working-class home
POD1000000014_S0000016	My dad was a mechanic with the state transport company. My mother was, as was the case with many in the day, a housewife.
POD1000000014_S0000017	We lived a very ordinary family life.
POD1000000014_S0000018	I didn't enjoy school. I was taught by the Christian Brothers, so I have some of my learning to thank them for.
POD1000000014_S0000019	I wouldn't say they contributed to a very happy school days, but the rest of my childhood was very enjoyable.
POD1000000014_S0000020	My mother would have been quite religious. It was a very different Ireland at the time.
POD1000000014_S0000021	Our house was busy, there were often relatives or neighbours popping in for cups of tea.
POD1000000014_S0000022	And so it was a pleasant place to grow up.
POD1000000014_S0000023	So you had a community service background before going to work in local government, that's correct isn't it?
POD1000000014_S0000024	Yes, I worked for the Welsh Housing Agency when it was set up that was funding housing associations on special needs housing.
POD1000000014_S0000025	But then I went to work for Cardiff Housing Department.
POD1000000014_S0000026	I was responsible for services like homelessness, sheltered housing for older people and so on.
POD1000000014_S0000027	and also manage the gypsy sites in Cardiff, so very interesting job.
POD1000000014_S0000028	but I gradually became more involved in mainstream housing through that.
POD1000000014_S0000029	And then before you became Welsh Ombudsman, you were Chief Executive of the Arts Council of Wales. Was that good fun?
POD1000000014_S0000030	It was very good fun it was at a time shortly after the creation of the Welsh Assembly.
POD1000000014_S0000031	Government in wales was interested in nation building if you like doing things to bring people together and they saw the arts is a valuable way of doing that.
POD1000000014_S0000032	From my perspective, obviously, I was also interested in community arts and arts outreach to people who are otherwise excluded.
POD1000000014_S0000033	So it fitted very well for me. I've never had any expertise in the arts, but I greatly enjoyed it.
POD1000000014_S0000034	and it was a very good time for the arts in Wales.
POD1000000014_S0000035	Now I think you must be one of the very few people to have occupied national ombudsman jobs in more than one country.
POD1000000014_S0000036	I don't know whether there's anyone else like you in that regard. But what was it like moving from being ombudsman in Wales to ombudsman in Ireland?
POD1000000014_S0000037	It was interesting.
POD1000000014_S0000038	I think the Ombudsman in Wales was a very significant player in the evolution of the devolved administration in Wales.
POD1000000014_S0000039	but particularly the work focused within the health sphere.
POD1000000014_S0000040	And an awful lot of the complaints that we dealt with were to do with clinical judgment.
POD1000000014_S0000041	So moving to Ireland, firstly I found that I don't have jurisdiction over clinical judgment.
POD1000000014_S0000042	but also I have jurisdiction over a much broader range of government services and local government.
POD1000000014_S0000043	So it was similar in some ways to Wales, but it was a bigger job, if you like.
POD1000000014_S0000044	in the context of a whole national government and a different set of issues to deal with.
POD1000000014_S0000045	In Ireland, you wear many hats. You're also the information commissioner.
POD1000000014_S0000046	and you deal with local government standards as well.
POD1000000014_S0000047	Do you find that an advantage in terms of being on the snow?
POD1000000014_S0000048	It's very helpful if you're committed to the same kinds of principles you're committed to good public services you're committed to open this you committed to transparency.
POD1000000014_S0000049	Those values work across all of the different hats I wear.
POD1000000014_S0000050	I suppose the biggest difference is as ombudsman you make recommendations, but in Ireland in the history of the office they've always been implemented.
POD1000000014_S0000051	As information commissioner, you make binding decisions, but those get challenged in the courts.
POD1000000014_S0000052	So despite what many people think to be the case, being an ombudsman in some ways is more effective in terms of having outcomes achieved than having binding powers as information commissioner.
POD1000000014_S0000053	What would you say have been the biggest challenges to you as Irish ombudsman?
POD1000000014_S0000054	You've obviously successfully dealt with them because you've been reappointed for a second term. But looking back on the six years that you've had, what are the biggest challenges?
POD1000000014_S0000055	The biggest challenge we faced was with the investigation into the Magdalene laundries.
POD1000000014_S0000056	As we looked more closely at the issues there, this is about women who had been held against their will
POD1000000014_S0000057	Often young women who'd had babies, sometimes school children, had been held against their will and forced to work for many years in laundries.
POD1000000014_S0000058	What I was looking at was a government compensation scheme and the Department of Justice had chosen to interpret that scheme very narrowly.
POD1000000014_S0000059	So, they were excluding young women, people who at the time were young women and had worked in the laundries, but being detained in industrial schools,
POD1000000014_S0000060	shared the same sites as the laundries but not technically resident in the laundries.
POD1000000014_S0000061	So we looked at that and felt that there was a huge injustice, but the initial response of the department was to reject our findings.
POD1000000014_S0000062	so that's required a high publicity campaign which ultimately led to the government changing its mind.
POD1000000014_S0000063	To be fair, I suspect if ministers had been involved from the outset, I don't think that the rejection we initially saw would have happened.
POD1000000014_S0000064	Did any of the people who experienced this detriment get in touch with you or was this a nature of you seeing the unfairness and acting on their behalf?
POD1000000014_S0000065	No, we had a small number of cases, but we investigated the whole scheme, so some of the people who benefited wouldn't even have known of my office.
POD1000000014_S0000066	So that's the advantage of having the power of own initiative to an ombudsman.
POD1000000014_S0000067	Yes, it is. You can investigate.
POD1000000014_S0000068	Even if you get complaints sometimes you're constrained because you can only investigate on the facts if you can't undertake on initiative investigations.
POD1000000014_S0000069	If something comes up that needs to be looked at, there's no constraints on me looking at that.
POD1000000014_S0000070	And particularly I found that in the context of excluded groups, it's a very powerful tool to use to make sure that people who don't come to you can nonetheless have access to justice.
POD1000000014_S0000071	Yeah and is that regarded as controversial in Ireland? I wouldn't have thought so.
POD1000000014_S0000072	No, no, it's just part of the toolkit available to the office. I don't think anybody gives it any second thought.
POD1000000014_S0000073	You behaved very bravely in this investigation because at one point when you were being blocked by ministers you threatened to go to the
POD1000000014_S0000075	Is that right?
POD1000000014_S0000076	When I was being blocked by officials, I went to the Minister for Justice and threw him to the
POD1000000014_S0000078	the Prime Minister.
POD1000000014_S0000079	I asked that they personally look to resolve the matter because it was such a stark injustice and reflected very poorly on the government of Ireland.
POD1000000014_S0000081	and the Minister for Justice both acted with great expediency and the matter was resolved almost immediately following their intervention.
POD1000000014_S0000082	I don't think you can be an effective ombudsman without having the kind of guts that you've shown throughout this.
POD1000000014_S0000083	And I hope you will sympathise with those ombudsmen that don't have own initiative powers because it seems to me to be a great handicap.
POD1000000014_S0000084	I think it is so many even in a welsh context where i didn't have them at the time.
POD1000000014_S0000085	You could be investigating something in one health board and see immediately that it was likely that the same problems were arising elsewhere.
POD1000000014_S0000086	But technically you couldn't extend your investigation beyond the body you were investigating.
POD1000000014_S0000087	That ability to extend an investigation to cover whichever bodies are involved is very powerful.
POD1000000014_S0000088	So a lot of my work, let's say, with asylum seekers and refugees in accommodation provided on behalf of the government.
POD1000000014_S0000089	I will be looking at complaints that are to do with health care, that are to do with access to benefits, that are to do with all kinds of things, access to housing.
POD1000000014_S0000090	other than the services provided by the Department of Justice in providing the accommodation
POD1000000014_S0000091	So it is just that capacity to broaden out an investigation as well as the capacity to instigate an investigation where you don't have complaints.
POD1000000014_S0000092	Now, my current own initiative investigation is looking at the situation of people under 65 living in nursing homes.
POD1000000014_S0000093	That's become a much more pressing issue in the coronavirus crisis. One of the people we've interviewed has already died. Another has contracted the virus.
POD1000000014_S0000094	So, although at this point it's not possible for obvious reasons to conclude the investigation,
POD1000000014_S0000095	What we have done is written to the leaders of all the political parties who are currently involved in talks leading to the formation of a new government.
POD1000000014_S0000096	to highlight the issue of people in institutional care so that at least what we've learned to date in the course of our investigation can hopefully help to shape the policies of the incoming government.
POD1000000014_S0000097	Can we just move on a little bit?
POD1000000014_S0000098	You are the president of the International Ombudsman Institute, which is a very important and prestigious job, which is very valuable to ombudsmen all over the world.
POD1000000014_S0000099	What added value do you think the IOI brings to our discussions?
POD1000000014_S0000100	I think one of the very important things is straightforwardly learning from each other.
POD1000000014_S0000101	Being an ombudsman is necessarily an isolated role. What you can't do is be too close to the people in the services which are within your jurisdiction.
POD1000000014_S0000102	So consequently, we have more in common with each other than we do with the people whose services we're looking at. And learning from each other is very important.
POD1000000014_S0000103	The IOI provides structured training opportunities. That's been one of the very valuable things we've done.
POD1000000014_S0000104	It provides best practice papers to show how things can best be done.
POD1000000014_S0000105	And of course, Rob, you yourself have been responsible for the best practice paper on peer review and the work you've done in that field.
POD1000000014_S0000106	But also I think the IOI has played a big part in supporting ombudsman organisations under threat.
POD1000000014_S0000107	We've seen, for instance, colleagues in many countries around the world who, because they're doing their job, are being threatened or ignored by their governments.
POD1000000014_S0000108	and we've seen things like budgets being cut, and we've seen people being denounced by government ministers and so on.
POD1000000014_S0000109	So the solidarity of the international ombudsman community is very important, but we also intervene quite directly.
POD1000000014_S0000110	I'll give an example of Cyprus where the Auditor General was looking to interfere in the work of the Ombudsman's office.
POD1000000014_S0000111	Following intervention from the IOI and others with the government of Cyprus, the Parliament in particular, the threats were withdrawn.
POD1000000014_S0000112	In Poland the ombudsman was threatened with large cuts to his budget. We sent in a commission of inquiry.
POD1000000014_S0000113	We interviewed government ministers, we interviewed the judiciary.
POD1000000014_S0000114	We carried out press conferences, we talked to NGOs and we managed to get a stay of execution.
POD1000000014_S0000115	And so we saw major threats to democracy there, but our intervention, along with those of others, has helped to ensure that that office is still there and is continuing to operate effectively.
POD1000000014_S0000116	That Polish intervention was crucial.
POD1000000014_S0000117	And what's one of the remarkable things about it was that you actually went there, didn't just talk about it.
POD1000000014_S0000118	but you put the political institutions under pressure by asking them to give an account of what they were doing.
POD1000000014_S0000119	Absolutely. So we did that in person and we did it through the media so that it had a very high profile within Poland. I think it's it's no good.
POD1000000014_S0000120	I did the same in Cyprus, media interviews, talking to people on the ground.
POD1000000014_S0000121	I think it's really important that solidarity is not something that comes just in the form of a letter, though sometimes a letter can be effective enough in itself.
POD1000000014_S0000122	but that you actually scale the intervention to the nature of the challenge.
POD1000000014_S0000123	We've talked about this quite a lot when we've not been on the radio, but
POD1000000014_S0000124	How important do you think it is that we as ombuds do not get involved in political matters?
POD1000000014_S0000125	Or do you think this is a cultural relic of British imperialism?
POD1000000014_S0000127	Whatever about British imperialism? No, I think it's a very complex question.
POD1000000014_S0000128	I think that for an ombudsman not to be involved in politics is scarcely possible because what we're actually doing is overseeing the services provided by the state.
POD1000000014_S0000129	and so therefore any comment we make on those services has the potential to be political.
POD1000000014_S0000130	What we can't be is party political and what we can't do is speak beyond the evidence of our case book.
POD1000000014_S0000131	So I talked earlier on about seeking to affect the formation of the government in Ireland to promote particular policies to favour disadvantaged groups of people.
POD1000000014_S0000132	But I'm doing that on the basis of investigations I'm carrying out.
POD1000000014_S0000133	I'm not doing it as Peter Tyndall's citizen. I'm doing it as Ombudsman of Ireland based on the evidence from my casebook.
POD1000000014_S0000134	And under those circumstances, I think it's entirely appropriate to intervene.
POD1000000014_S0000135	I think it becomes problematic if people are seen to be intervening on issues which go beyond their own work as ombudsman.
POD1000000014_S0000136	And I think that's where it would become problematic.
POD1000000014_S0000137	But I do think that if you've got evidence, then it's important that you use that evidence where it can be most effective in securing justice for the people who've come to you.
POD1000000014_S0000138	So we're moving towards the end but I wanted to ask you about how you're coping with the coronavirus.
POD1000000014_S0000139	what sort of impact has it had short term and longer term on the way you operate?
POD1000000014_S0000140	Yeah, it's an interesting one.
POD1000000014_S0000141	The first thing was that we surprised ourselves by being able to get ourselves in a position to work remotely much quicker than we might have done otherwise.
POD1000000014_S0000142	I suppose if it's proved anything, it's that when there is a crisis, it's surprising how long-term problems can be solved in a hurry.
POD1000000014_S0000143	So we've been able to operate all of our services more or less without change throughout the crisis.
POD1000000014_S0000144	We've had some changes in volumes of work coming to us.
POD1000000014_S0000145	We've put a bit more emphasis on project work, but by and large, people are able to make their complaints to us.
POD1000000014_S0000146	They can ring us, they can email us.
POD1000000014_S0000147	They can contact us on the web.
POD1000000014_S0000148	We're even able to collect our posts that we're discouraging people from using the post at the moment. But the effect of that is that we can keep going.
POD1000000014_S0000149	The difficulties we face are probably more to do with the difficulties being faced by the services we're dealing with.
POD1000000014_S0000150	So we've told the health service, we've told nursing homes, and we've told the Department of Social Protection, which deals with benefits and pensions.
POD1000000014_S0000151	that we understand that it will take them longer to respond to us and that in some instances they won't be able to.
POD1000000014_S0000152	So, so we understand that, but in general, we've been able to keep going.
POD1000000014_S0000153	Just to give an example of the kind of things we've been dealing with.
POD1000000014_S0000154	We had one gentleman stuck in Poland who couldn't get back to Ireland, who'd been denied benefit in Ireland, even though his wife and children were in Ireland and he normally lived and worked
POD1000000014_S0000155	and we were able to intervene successfully so that he got his benefits so we're able to deal with issues as they arise.
POD1000000014_S0000156	I think in the longer term the big two things really one of them is just practical.
POD1000000014_S0000157	We now know that it's possible for more of our people to work effectively from home and i can't see us going back to the situation before where only a very small number of people did that.
POD1000000014_S0000158	I think more people will work from home as a consequence of what we've learned during the crisis.
POD1000000014_S0000159	But the second issue for me has been the appalling death toll among people in institutional care, many of whom shouldn't be there.
POD1000000014_S0000160	And I think we have to redouble our efforts in working on their behalf after the crisis to make sure that should there be a resurgence or should something else like this come along,
POD1000000014_S0000161	that they're not as exposed and as vulnerable as they are at the moment.
POD1000000014_S0000162	It makes complete sense for the ombudsman to be looking at both health and social care matters.
POD1000000014_S0000163	and not as in this country to have a separation where one ombudsman looks at social care and the other looks at health.
POD1000000014_S0000164	I'll just, if I may Rob, just add something.
POD1000000014_S0000165	One of the things that's noticeably different between Ireland and the UK, England in particular, is that there is a single national ombudsman in Ireland's
POD1000000014_S0000166	so that issues of health and social care both come into my jurisdiction.
POD1000000014_S0000167	The reality is these are complex interlinked issues.
POD1000000014_S0000168	and trying to deal with them with two separate ombudsmen offices is complicated enough as it is
POD1000000014_S0000169	Trying to do so in the context where you have MP filters.
POD1000000014_S0000170	where you have different systems applying in different parts of the UK, it's impossibly difficult for yourselves
POD1000000014_S0000171	but you manage it very well along with the local government ombudsman.
POD1000000014_S0000172	I have to say you've managed in practice to overcome the difficulties, but it's also an impossibly complex scenario for complainants.
POD1000000014_S0000173	In Ireland, somebody wants to complain about public services, they come to my office.
POD1000000014_S0000174	In your case, it's much more complicated.
POD1000000014_S0000175	And I do hope that the proposals for ombudsman reform that we've seen in the UK over recent years are not entirely lost.
POD1000000014_S0000176	and that we do come to a much more satisfactory situation where there's a proper national ombudsman and where people can bring their complaints regardless of what particular public service they are complaining about.
POD1000000014_S0000177	And I do hope that happens before I die, which I'm increasingly becoming doubtful about, but we'll have to wait and see.
POD1000000014_S0000178	Peter, you conducted the peer review of my organisation and then you appeared before the Select Committee in Parliament.
POD1000000014_S0000179	So that was not an expected development.
POD1000000014_S0000180	What was it like being the peer reviewer who had to go before the UK Parliament?
POD1000000014_S0000181	That was an interesting experience Rob.
POD1000000014_S0000182	I think it would have been much more challenging if I hadn't been quite so impressed by the quality of the service your office provides.
POD1000000014_S0000183	It wasn't as though when we looked at the service we used a lot of objective criteria
POD1000000014_S0000184	And obviously, with any office, there is room for improvement. But in general, I was able to give reassurance to the committee as the quality of service that complainants were receiving.
POD1000000014_S0000185	but also to highlight some of the deficiencies in powers and in jurisdiction that are causing you difficulties in practice.
POD1000000014_S0000186	but I suppose what I'd want to say, I was very impressed by the quality of the people in your office.
POD1000000014_S0000187	and it was a very good experience. They were very open with us.
POD1000000014_S0000188	We talk to your staff without talking to yourself and the managers. So we were able for people to express a view as they saw fit. And I think people were very complimentary.
POD1000000014_S0000189	So I think, as I say, it was an interesting experience.
POD1000000014_S0000190	it's always challenging to go before parliamentary committees and the session was quite searching.
POD1000000014_S0000191	I think the committee wanted to reassure itself that this wasn't some kind of hagiography.
POD1000000014_S0000192	What's we were satisfied in the end that we were able to say no we've looked in detail at this office.
POD1000000014_S0000193	There are areas which can improve, but by and large this is an improving service that's delivering good quality ombudsman service to the people of England and to the UK.
POD1000000014_S0000194	Well, I think the structural point is that thanks to the IOI, this whole system of peer review looks like it has legs for the wider ombudsman community.
POD1000000014_S0000195	and it is an effective and inexpensive way of adding to scrutiny of ombudsman schemes. So thank you for the role that you played in pioneering that.
POD1000000014_S0000196	One thing beyond that too, Rob, is that
POD1000000014_S0000197	Since the review was undertaken, the IOI, along with other bodies, have worked quite hard
POD1000000014_S0000198	with the Venice Commission and the Council of Europe in developing a set of overriding principles for ombudsman offices, the Venice principles as they've become known.
POD1000000014_S0000199	and they've now been adopted by the Council of Europe.
POD1000000014_S0000200	And that's the first time there's been a proper international standard against which ombuds officers can be judged.
POD1000000014_S0000201	And so I'm keen to see them being used as they are being used now in the context of peer reviews.
POD1000000014_S0000202	so that there is an objective set of internationally recognised standards against which you're measuring a particular ombudsman office.
POD1000000014_S0000203	So I think that's again marks another step forward and one that I'm very pleased to have seen develop.
POD1000000014_S0000204	I think when I undertook the peer review of the Catalonian ombudsman with my Belgian counterpart,
POD1000000014_S0000205	we used those very same Venice principles as the benchmark against which to judge the Catalonian ombudsman.
POD1000000014_S0000206	and it is very helpful to have that because it's without prejudice.
POD1000000014_S0000207	it applies to everyone, so I think it is an important development.
POD1000000014_S0000208	So two final questions. How have you, Peter Tyndall, reacted to working remotely, being at home with your family?
POD1000000014_S0000209	I've enjoyed it, to be honest.
POD1000000014_S0000210	It hasn't been too frustrating that technology can be an issue from time to time but it hasn't been too difficult
POD1000000014_S0000211	it's been less difficult than I would have expected.
POD1000000014_S0000212	as time goes on, I think the issue of visible leadership comes into it, doesn't it?
POD1000000014_S0000213	So, you know, you actually want to be with your people again, but it's worked surprisingly well.
POD1000000014_S0000214	And
POD1000000014_S0000215	As I say, I think for the office itself, I think we'll see more remote working in the future.
POD1000000014_S0000216	Thank you. So lastly then, it's what I always ask my guests,
POD1000000014_S0000217	What advice would you give to young colleagues newly arriving as caseworkers in the embryonic ombudsman profession?
POD1000000014_S0000218	For me, there's a couple of characteristics that have to be embodied by people working in the service or as an ombudsman.
POD1000000014_S0000219	We have to be objective, we have to be fair.
POD1000000014_S0000220	We have to be even handed. So the first advice often is make sure you know the whole story before you reach a conclusion.
POD1000000014_S0000221	But underpinning all of that, I would say that if you haven't got a passionate commitment to justice, then you're in the wrong job.
POD1000000014_S0000222	Because what this fundamentally is about is people who believe in fairness, people who believe in justice, and people who want to use their own efforts to make sure that nobody is denied access to justice.
POD1000000014_S0000223	So that's what we're here for.
POD1000000014_S0000224	Thank you so much, Peter.
POD1000000014_S0000225	your answers were stimulating and also inspirational.
POD1000000014_S0000227	We're all very grateful for the time you've given for this interview.
POD1000000014_S0000228	Thanks a lot.
POD1000000014_S0000230	My next guest will be the Catalonian Ombudsman, Rafael Rebo.
POD1000000014_S0000231	So he'll be joining us from Barcelona.
POD1000000014_S0000232	In the meantime, this is Rob Behrens on behalf of Radio Ombudsman and saying have a good day and stay safe.
POD1000000017_S0000001	From The New York Times Magazine, I'm Nicole Hannah-Jones. This is 1619.
POD1000000017_S0000003	This week, Wesley Morris on the birth of American music.
POD1000000017_S0000005	So last fall, I am at my friend's house. We are making dinner. I'm chopping vegetables. And I asked my friend Brett, who was cooking with me, can you put on some music?
POD1000000017_S0000006	And he said, what do you want to listen to? And I said, have you ever heard of Yacht Rock? And he said, what? I said, Yacht Rock, have you ever heard of this? And he goes, no, I have not.
POD1000000017_S0000007	So he finds the Yacht Rock station in Pandora, which I don't know why or how he's still a Pandora guy with all due respect to Pandora He is one and he finds the Iraq station and
POD1000000017_S0000009	At some point, Bright has to go run an errand. I think I might have sent him on one. I don't remember. But he's gone. So I'm alone. Just me. With the vegetables. And Yacht Rock.
POD1000000017_S0000011	It gives me plenty of time to really think about the songs I'm hearing.
POD1000000017_S0000013	We're talking about music made between the years of I don't know I would say like 1975 to about 1983 things like
POD1000000017_S0000015	Aces how long?
POD1000000017_S0000017	seals and croft doing summer breeze i'm hearing things like
POD1000000017_S0000019	Steal Away by Robbie Dupri.
POD1000000017_S0000021	and the Doobie Brothers, what a fool believes.
POD1000000017_S0000023	It is like our soft, raucous period in American popular music.
POD1000000017_S0000025	The joke of Yacht Rock is that whoever invented it and whoever's making a playlist out of these songs is basically saying that they're inconsequential and that what's in them doesn't matter.
POD1000000017_S0000027	But what I know I'm hearing is something bigger and deeper than that.
POD1000000017_S0000029	Every song has something about it that is similar to the other songs.
POD1000000017_S0000031	I'm hearing things like Rosanna by Toto.
POD1000000017_S0000033	which seems perfectly banal. It has a really good beat, sort of builds to its chorus.
POD1000000017_S0000035	But then at the end...
POD1000000017_S0000037	I'm hearing
POD1000000017_S0000039	the great doo-wop harmonies of the 50s and 60s.
POD1000000017_S0000041	There is something jazz-like in the syncopated music of something like Steely Dan.
POD1000000017_S0000043	You can hear in somebody like Michael McDonald.
POD1000000017_S0000045	That is like a gospel breakdown.
POD1000000017_S0000047	What I am hearing in all of these songs is basically blackness.
POD1000000017_S0000049	And the song in which I am hearing it the deepest and strongest and most powerfully, at least to me, standing in that kitchen, chopping those vegetables, was when Kenny Loggins' This Is It comes on.
POD1000000017_S0000051	It's got a kind of loosely disco-like rhythm to it. There's a lot of percussion sort of going back and forth and around.
POD1000000017_S0000053	Kenny Loggins is basically sing-whispering the verses in this song.
POD1000000017_S0000055	doing this very light
POD1000000017_S0000056	Cool
POD1000000017_S0000058	And then in the pre-chorus, Kenny Loggins disappears and who shows up? Michael McDonald.
POD1000000017_S0000060	Giving Kenny Loggins plenty of time to gather himself.
POD1000000017_S0000062	When he sings the word miracle, he doesn't sing miracle. He goes miracle
POD1000000017_S0000064	Like he is scraping the bottom of a pan to get all of the good bits off of it before you pour the gravy in.
POD1000000017_S0000066	Scraping the pan is the blackest thing you can do as a singer and here's Kenny Loggins as this white artist doing it
POD1000000017_S0000068	And then the gravy comes.
POD1000000017_S0000070	He is like at the top of the church at this point.
POD1000000017_S0000071	He is like elevated himself to the rafters. There's like no more. He is like at the roof trying to clear a way to get to heaven, but there's just church roof in the way.
POD1000000017_S0000073	He's not the greatest singer, but there's a kind of gumption and nerve to the singing of this song.
POD1000000017_S0000075	that cannot be denied. A tip of the hat to him.
POD1000000017_S0000076	I just had to stand there and I just I actually cracked up. I had I just put down the knife and I cracked up. And it felt so pleasurable. And then I started thinking about all these other singers I love.
POD1000000017_S0000078	I'm thinking about Amy Winehouse.
POD1000000017_S0000080	I'm thinking about Annie Lennox.
POD1000000017_S0000082	Think about George Michael
POD1000000017_S0000084	I think about Chris Stapleton.
POD1000000017_S0000085	who practices a kind of muscley blues that gets written off his country because he's a big white guy in a hat.
POD1000000017_S0000087	and one of the many phases in which David Bovee really wanted to make R&B and soul music.
POD1000000017_S0000089	This is the sound not just of Black America, but the sound of America. It is deeply American. Almost especially when it's sung by British people like David Bowie and Annie Lennox and Amy Winehouse.
POD1000000017_S0000090	And it fills me with pride. Like, I know that there is something irresistible and ultimately inevitable about Black music being a part of American popular music.
POD1000000017_S0000091	But it also reminds me that there's a history to this. A very painful history. And in the most perversely ironic way, it's this historical pain that is responsible for this music.
POD1000000017_S0000093	Some of the oldest recordings we have of black American music are from the 1930s.
POD1000000017_S0000094	And there are songs that would have been sung by Americans born into slavery. There's this one called Old Ship of Zion.
POD1000000017_S0000095	You can hear in it these four men. Their voices are moving in and out of each other.
POD1000000017_S0000097	And it's beautiful, and it's also sad. You can feel that in your bones.
POD1000000017_S0000098	And then there'd be music that was completely the opposite, like Old Coon Dog, for instance.
POD1000000017_S0000100	You can hear the playfulness in the song.
POD1000000017_S0000102	And you've got this banjo, this great African instrument that becomes the bedrock of American music in so many ways. And that thing is dancing.
POD1000000017_S0000103	And then you have someone like Billy McRae.
POD1000000017_S0000104	And oh my god, you can hear in his singing what we would now call something like the live long day.
POD1000000017_S0000106	Years and years of hard work.
POD1000000017_S0000107	and unimaginable sorrow.
POD1000000017_S0000109	You can also hear in all of this music
POD1000000017_S0000111	this undeniable sound of hope.
POD1000000017_S0000113	All of these melodies and cadences and emotions are things that would have been passed down generation after generation. It's what you would have heard on a plantation. It's what you would have heard walking by a plantation.
POD1000000017_S0000114	It's what you would have heard passing a black person doing his job, entertaining himself doing the drudgery of work, the way a guy named Thomas Dartmouth Rice did sometime around the 1830s.
POD1000000017_S0000115	As the story goes, T.D. Rice, a white man, this anonymous nobody actor trying to make ends meet,
POD1000000017_S0000116	One day he's touring with a troop in Cincinnati, or maybe it was Pittsburgh. We don't really know, but the myth basically goes TD race happened upon an old black man cleaning a horse in a stable.
POD1000000017_S0000117	The man was doing his job on property owned by a white man named Crow.
POD1000000017_S0000119	He heard the tune this old black man was singing. He saw the way this man moved his body as he was cleaning this horse.
POD1000000017_S0000120	Now, we don't know what tune this old man would have been singing.
POD1000000017_S0000122	Whatever rice here is coming out of this man's mouth is captivating to him. And what he sees is an opportunity.
POD1000000017_S0000124	Because showbiz in the 1830s looked like this.
POD1000000017_S0000126	Italian operas
POD1000000017_S0000128	British plays, entertainment, imported from Europe. All the people performing this stuff would have been white, the audiences would have been white.
POD1000000017_S0000129	After all, it's 1830. Slavery is in full effect.
POD1000000017_S0000131	And when it came to entertainment, there was nothing new, nothing truly American.
POD1000000017_S0000133	And so when Tini Rice hears this black man singing this song and moving his body in this particular way, ding! A light bulb goes off.
POD1000000017_S0000134	And he takes that light bulb and runs all the way to the theater. He figures out a way to melt down some cork.
POD1000000017_S0000135	lets it cool, presumably takes a rag or maybe even his hand if it's cool enough.
POD1000000017_S0000137	And then he paints his face black.
POD1000000017_S0000139	He goes out on stage, but instead of doing his regular act, he's got this horse groomers tune. Except now he's given the tune lyrics.
POD1000000017_S0000140	Come listen, all you gals and boys, I'm just from Tuckahoe. I'm going to sing a little song. My name's Jim Crow.
POD1000000017_S0000142	and the lyrics give the horse groomer a name, and the name is Jim Crow.
POD1000000017_S0000144	So the crowd goes crazy. They go so bananas, the man gets 20 encores.
POD1000000017_S0000146	This is the first time a paying audience is basically electrified by a white man with a black face. This is the night that Jim Crow was allegedly introduced to America, this mascot of American racism.
POD1000000017_S0000147	And this is what America really wanted, which was its own original art form that is not an Italian opera and isn't some British guy coming over and thesbying all over them.
POD1000000017_S0000148	And here is Thomas Dartmouth Rice giving it to them. This is the night that American popular culture was born.
POD1000000017_S0000150	Oh boy. I mean, you know how it goes. This sensational thing happens and then everybody wants to get on the bandwagon and do their own.
POD1000000017_S0000151	So you have other minstrel acts who come along and try to do what Thomas Dartmouth Rice is doing, a song and a dance.
POD1000000017_S0000152	and a black face on their white skin.
POD1000000017_S0000154	And then from these solo acts, you have basically bands forming.
POD1000000017_S0000156	And the bands have all the instruments that you would have in a band that you'd recognize now. There's a banjo and a fiddle and some tambourines and percussion in the form of bones, which would come from a pig sometimes.
POD1000000017_S0000157	That is the formation of what will become the minstrel troop.
POD1000000017_S0000159	And the place that Minstrelsy took hold was in the North.
POD1000000017_S0000160	places like Philadelphia and New York and Boston where you'd have these theaters dedicated to minstrel acts where minstrel acts would just move into a theater and do their act night after night after night after night after night.
POD1000000017_S0000161	And a lot of these performers have never been meaningfully South to have a meaningful relationship with Black people. And so they just made stuff up based on what they thought Black people were like.
POD1000000017_S0000163	They were able to draw on things that were coming to America from other parts of Europe, like the polka.
POD1000000017_S0000165	And so you had over the course of the formation of this culture an inherent mixing. You had some amazing mix of an imagined blackness
POD1000000017_S0000166	real, actual Irish melodies and Polish music with what we would now call gospel but spiritual harmonies interlaced together with this African banjo.
POD1000000017_S0000168	Basically welding into a fusion that becomes the thing that everybody wants to try to do
POD1000000017_S0000170	The whole thing just sweeps the nation and for the rest of the 19th century, this is the shit. Can we say that?
POD1000000017_S0000172	And so for the rest of the 19th century, this is the shit.
POD1000000017_S0000174	This is America's primary form of entertainment. People are going crazy for blackface minstrels. You have little boys going to bed and dreaming about how they can become part of this minstrel show.
POD1000000017_S0000175	Some of those people having these dreams go on to become people like Stephen Foster.
POD1000000017_S0000177	Stephen Foster, the man widely credited as being the father of American music.
POD1000000017_S0000179	Some of his songs, some of his most famous songs, songs you know, songs you love, songs you still sing, songs your children, if you have them, they still sing. Some of those songs were written for blackface performers.
POD1000000017_S0000181	And if you listen to something like Camp Town Races, you can hear in it all of its minstrel properties.
POD1000000017_S0000183	The song of course is written in so-called negro dialect. I mean, instead of saying going, you're saying gwine.
POD1000000017_S0000185	Like instead of saying OF for of, you get a lot of DE for duh.
POD1000000017_S0000187	This is a white person imagining how a black person would sing this song.
POD1000000017_S0000188	And that was the Gold Rush era hit.
POD1000000017_S0000190	This is the I wanna hold your hand of 1851.
POD1000000017_S0000192	Part of the problem that we still live with now is that it was so much the heart and soul of American culture that it wasn't that it became not racist.
POD1000000017_S0000193	It just was a thing that you did. If you wanted to be an entertainer at any point after 1830, you in all likelihood were at least going to try to be a blackface minstrel, even if you were black.
POD1000000017_S0000195	After the Civil War ends and there's an opportunity for Black people to perform, they have to do what the nation wants. And what the nation wants at that point is blackface.
POD1000000017_S0000196	And now, giving you Noise in Tempo.
POD1000000017_S0000197	Effie Miller and Scatman Carulla.
POD1000000017_S0000198	So black people blacked up and performed as black people who weren't actually black.
POD1000000017_S0000200	By the time you have black people painting their faces black to perform as black people The only question you can really ask at this point is what the hell is going on. Why is this happening?
POD1000000017_S0000201	What was so captivating about seeing black people represented this way? Why would a white audience have clamored for it so much? I think one of the things that it offered was an opportunity to feel good about a thing that actually felt really bad at the time.
POD1000000017_S0000202	People were really torn about whether to continue with slavery or whether to abolish it. The minstrel show didn't really give you an answer.
POD1000000017_S0000203	But it provided a platform by which you could either escape from actually having to think about that question that really was tearing the nation apart or depending on which show you wind up seeing.
POD1000000017_S0000204	It fully engaged you in the lightest possible way about enslaved people and how you didn't really have to feel so bad for them because they like being enslaved. You got to laugh at a thing that you actually felt so anguished about.
POD1000000017_S0000205	You get to watch these Black people who are really a source of national agony outside the theater become fools inside the theater. And in sitting in that theater, watching these white men in blackface make fools of Black people
POD1000000017_S0000206	A white audience could feel cultured. They could feel civilized. They could feel superior to the people they were watching be made fun of.
POD1000000017_S0000207	And in a crazy way, watching them dehumanize what really have been an opportunity for a white audience to feel so much better about their own humanity.
POD1000000017_S0000209	By the time you get to the 20th century, minstrelsy is still with us. It is the basis upon which American movies are built. This country's first movie blockbuster
POD1000000017_S0000210	DW Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, full of white men villainously in blackface.
POD1000000017_S0000212	and America's first talking motion picture.
POD1000000017_S0000214	The Jazz Singer. About a Jewish man who feels most himself not as a Jewish man, struggling with his Jewish identity and pleasing his cantor father. No, no!
POD1000000017_S0000216	It's when he blacks his face up and performs Mammy as a Negro.
POD1000000017_S0000218	Some of America's favorite stars did numbers in blackface.
POD1000000017_S0000220	Judy Garland performed in blackface.
POD1000000017_S0000222	Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire both performed in blackface.
POD1000000017_S0000224	White Christmas has a whole number. The most famous number in White Christmas involves a blackface tune.
POD1000000017_S0000226	But at the same time, there's the beginnings of a recording industry. And you had Black artists who had access to recording studios.
POD1000000017_S0000227	Out of these recordings you have people like Muddy Waters
POD1000000017_S0000229	inventing and perfecting blues rhythm, blues ideas, blues expression, the expression of
POD1000000017_S0000231	of a fully human black self in American popular art.
POD1000000017_S0000233	He had a kind of confidence that most people would never have heard coming from a black person before.
POD1000000017_S0000235	And this is just the beginning.
POD1000000017_S0000237	You have the advent of a place like Blue Note Records where lots of amazing jazz was created and then released into the world. People like Sidney Bechet.
POD1000000017_S0000239	and Boobie Armstrong.
POD1000000017_S0000241	in Duke Ellington.
POD1000000017_S0000243	You have black musicians thinking about how to move not only music forward, but American culture forward.
POD1000000017_S0000245	Thinking about how these instruments can do other things besides make what we think of as Western European classical music.
POD1000000017_S0000247	Taking music to a place that nobody had ever tried to previously take it.
POD1000000017_S0000249	People who just kept pushing it forward and beyond.
POD1000000017_S0000251	And then you have the development of the single most important movement black people have ever had artistically.
POD1000000017_S0000253	And that is the advent of Motown Records.
POD1000000017_S0000255	Motown is the most powerful mass-produced expression of black glamour, of black self-confidence, of black self-reliance.
POD1000000017_S0000257	Its project was to get black producers, black musicians, black singers to take quote white, quote Western musical ideas of orchestration. Strings and horns.
POD1000000017_S0000259	in straightforward harmonies.
POD1000000017_S0000261	and you marry them to a black weekend.
POD1000000017_S0000263	Where on Saturday night you're at a juke joint, having a good time with rhythm and blues music, guitar and drum and bass.
POD1000000017_S0000265	Sex, basically.
POD1000000017_S0000267	And then you go home slightly hungover.
POD1000000017_S0000269	and you wake up and you go to church on Sunday morning.
POD1000000017_S0000271	where there's a whole other musical experience involving hand claps and different harmonic arrangements and call and response.
POD1000000017_S0000273	A lot of feeling, a lot of oomph, a lot of gratitude.
POD1000000017_S0000275	You have the combination of these three different areas of musical expression happening at the same time in just about every single Motown record.
POD1000000017_S0000277	Whether it's the four tops doing Reach Out, I'll Be There.
POD1000000017_S0000279	Or Martha and the Vandellas doing heat wave.
POD1000000017_S0000281	on something like heat wave you can hear hands slapping the tambourine like it actually is sunday morning
POD1000000017_S0000283	Then when everything is firing
POD1000000017_S0000285	It's just the most exciting romantic sound you're ever going to hear. And at the center of it is what can only be described as a refulgent, tasteful blackness.
POD1000000017_S0000287	Here you have in Motown a force that is actively combating these ideas of black people as being inherently inferior.
POD1000000017_S0000289	Motown is the antidote to American minstrelsy.
POD1000000017_S0000291	And this is what I was thinking about standing there in that kitchen chopping those vegetables. It's the thing that made me laugh was just how all that history
POD1000000017_S0000292	is just very silently coursing through this music. It might not even be aware that it's even there. It's so thoroughly atomized into American culture. It's going to show up in ways that even people making the art can't quite put their finger on.
POD1000000017_S0000294	What you're hearing in black music that's so appealing to so many people of all races across time is possibility, struggle, it is strife, it is humor.
POD1000000017_S0000295	It is sex. It is confidence. And that's ironic. Because this is the sound of a people who for decades and centuries have been denied freedom.
POD1000000017_S0000296	And yet, what you respond to in black music is the ultimate expression of a belief in that freedom. The belief that the struggle is worth it. That the pain begets joy.
POD1000000017_S0000297	And that that joy you're experiencing is not only contagious, it's necessary and urgent and irresistible. Black music is American music.
POD1000000017_S0000298	Because as Americans, we say we believe in freedom. And that's what we tell the world. And the power of black music is that it's the ultimate expression of that belief in American freedom.
POD1000000018_S0000000	When Andy Griffith passed away in 2012, CNN covered his death off and on the entire day.
POD1000000018_S0000001	You've all seen this type of news coverage before. An overview of the career, images of the star on their prime, phone-in conversations with other celebrities who were close with the departed.
POD1000000018_S0000003	Larry King is one of the people who called in to talk that day. He'd had Andy on his various shows numerous times, and he mentioned something in passing that's really interesting.
POD1000000018_S0000005	What Larry said is that a lawyer named Percy Foreman was the man who inspired the character Matlock.
POD1000000018_S0000007	This was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people, even today, believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named Bobby Lee Cook.
POD1000000018_S0000009	However, in 2015, three years after Larry King said something that most people would assume was incorrect, the creator of Matlock did confirm that the character was based on Percy Foreman.
POD1000000018_S0000010	a criminal defense attorney from Houston, Texas, who lost only 53 of the 1,500 cases where clients of his faced the death penalty, with only one of those losses resulting in an actual execution.
POD1000000018_S0000012	Percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer, no denying it, but also due to the Texas court system's practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict.
POD1000000018_S0000014	So instead of one judge who's heard it all before determining his client's fate,
POD1000000018_S0000016	Percy had 12 average citizens from the local community sitting right there, waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation wasn't a victim at all.
POD1000000018_S0000017	They were up to no good. The community was far better off without that element in it. And even if his client had killed him, well hell, they needed killing.
POD1000000018_S0000019	Foreman called it misdemeanor murder. That's where a jury might convict you of ending another person's life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you'd receive for a misdemeanor crime.
POD1000000018_S0000020	Often, nothing more than probation. No time at all. It's essentially a sanctioned form of vigilante justice.
POD1000000018_S0000021	Percy Foreman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it's still being used in Texas today. People who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as the Texas defense.
POD1000000018_S0000023	Now, Jim Denny wasn't from Texas. He was from Tennessee.
POD1000000018_S0000024	The Buffalo Valley area, about 60 miles east of Nashville, was a real poor area to be born in 1911.
POD1000000018_S0000025	When a 16-year-old Jim Denney got hired to work the mailroom of WSM Radio's parent company, he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself.
POD1000000018_S0000027	Denny got this job in 1927. That year, the young radio program WSM Barn Dance was referred to as the Grand Ole Opry for the first time on air.
POD1000000018_S0000029	Every time an odd job came up at the Opry, Jim would take it so he could hang out backstage, see the artists, and see how the show was made.
POD1000000018_S0000030	Within 20 years, Denny had worked his way up to Director of the Artist Service Bureau at WSM, which meant he was in charge of booking the acts on the Opry.
POD1000000018_S0000032	There's a few funny things from Jim Denny's time at the Grand Ole Opry. Like the one about Elvis Presley's big debut.
POD1000000018_S0000033	Elvis was still a teenager when Denny did Sam Phillips the favor of letting Elvis come on the show to play his not-country arrangement of Blue Moon of Kentucky.
POD1000000018_S0000035	it didn't go well. Denny is rumored to have told Elvis backstage, you ain't going nowhere son, you ought to go back to driving a truck.
POD1000000018_S0000037	Denny's also the guy who fired Hank Williams over the telephone. And there's the time when Jim made Johnny Cash wait outside his office for two hours before letting him in to ask why Cash should be allowed to play on the Opry.
POD1000000018_S0000039	Cash mentioned that he presently had a song called I Walked the Line in the top 10.
POD1000000018_S0000041	Jim Denny was what many people referred to in those times as a hard man. Today, I think they'd have some different words for him. And that's why Ernest Tubb tried to shoot him in 1957.
POD1000000018_S0000043	You're listening to Cocaine and Rhinestones, the podcast about 20th century country music and the lives of those who gave it to us.
POD1000000018_S0000044	My name is Tyler Mahan Coe. I've heard these stories my whole life.
POD1000000018_S0000045	As far as I can tell, here's the truth about this one.
POD1000000018_S0000047	It's shocking to hear Ernest Tubbs' name associated with any kind of violence whatsoever.
POD1000000018_S0000049	There are plenty of stories about him, but most of them are about how great of a guy he was. He had an adorable nickname, E.T., and you can hear admiration in the voice of everyone who calls him that.
POD1000000018_S0000051	Crisp, Texas is a ghost town now. Ernest Tubb was born there in 1914 into a family of sharecroppers. Like most sharecroppers' children, Ernest grew up working on farms all over the area.
POD1000000018_S0000052	Long days in the field, entertainment from a stereo in the evenings, an early bedtime, and you get back up the next day to do it all over again. Typical day for a sharecropper.
POD1000000018_S0000054	Like a great number of artists we'll learn about in future episodes, it was all over for a 14-year-old Ernest Tubb the first time he heard Jimmy Rogers sing.
POD1000000018_S0000056	The obsession was instant and it would steer the course of the rest of his life.
POD1000000018_S0000058	Hearing Jimmy Rogers is what led Ernest Hove to decide he simply had to become a country singer.
POD1000000018_S0000059	It's also very specifically what caused him, three decades later, to want to shoot a .357 Magnum at Jim Denny.
POD1000000018_S0000061	In 1933, Jimmy Rogers died young of tuberculosis. He was 35.
POD1000000018_S0000062	The death of his idol was extremely upsetting for Ernest. However, it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams.
POD1000000018_S0000063	He moved to San Antonio, made a few guest appearances on a friend's radio show, and managed to secure his own early morning show, which aired twice a week. Not bad for a 19-year-old kid.
POD1000000018_S0000064	But don't get the wrong idea. He was nowhere near the big time, and the pay was quite slim.
POD1000000018_S0000066	E.T. had to keep two other jobs besides the radio gig. Some days he was a ditch digger, and other days a drugstore clerk.
POD1000000018_S0000067	Holding down three jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife, Elaine. They didn't waste any time before starting to have kids either.
POD1000000018_S0000069	Ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving towards the life of his hero, Jimmy Rogers.
POD1000000018_S0000070	He'd had this small picture of Jimmy for years now and it was in pretty bad shape. So he got a phone book and looked up the number for Jimmy Rogers' widow, Carrie.
POD1000000018_S0000071	He called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger, better photo of Jimmy that Ernest could have. Maybe even one that was autographed.
POD1000000018_S0000072	Carrie was super nice and she did have such a photo that Ernest could have and went so far as to invite him out to her house in Carreville, Texas to get the picture.
POD1000000018_S0000073	Ernest drove out there the next Sunday he wasn't working, taking Elaine and their baby Justin on the trip.
POD1000000018_S0000075	They'd planned to stay for maybe 10 minutes and ended up hanging out for over two hours, looking at costumes, guitars, and pictures brought out by Mrs. Rogers, hearing her stories about how high on the hog they'd lived merely a few years earlier.
POD1000000018_S0000076	E.T. could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he'd be laying down to sleep that night, having held Jimmy Rogers' signature Martin acoustic guitar, with Jimmy's name inlaid in pearl across the fretboard and the word thanks written on the back, upside down.
POD1000000018_S0000077	so he could flip it over to show audiences.
POD1000000018_S0000079	Choose your biggest dead hero and try to think of how you'd feel if a similar experience happened to you. It's mind-blowing!
POD1000000018_S0000080	Okay, now add this on top of that. A few months later, Kerry Rogers called Ernest to say she'd listened for his radio show as he'd asked for her to do.
POD1000000018_S0000081	On one hand, she offered to help ET out with the access she still had to music business big shots.
POD1000000018_S0000082	On the other hand, she didn't think he sounded like Jimmy Rogers when he sang, which is basically the only thing in the world Ernest Hubb wanted to do in this phase of his life.
POD1000000018_S0000083	and everyone around him had told him that's exactly what he'd been doing the whole time.
POD1000000018_S0000085	Anyway, she still hooked E.T. up with Elsie McWilliams, the writer of a few great Jimmy Rogers songs.
POD1000000018_S0000086	Ernest Tubb made a couple of records that didn't sell very well, did some touring, and ended up back home, doing low-paying radio again and working two or three side jobs like before. Driving around a beer truck was one of them.
POD1000000018_S0000088	After a while back at home, Ernest had to have his tonsils taken out. He'd later say the doctors told him not to sing or yodel for a while after the surgery, but he didn't listen.
POD1000000018_S0000089	Jumping right back into his normal routine, we injured his throat.
POD1000000018_S0000091	It changed his voice forever.
POD1000000018_S0000093	Ernest held a self-deprecating sense of humor about his own voice for the rest of his life. He loved to say that 9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing much better than he could.
POD1000000018_S0000094	I don't know if he really believed that. It's always been strange to me. I think George Jones, indisputably the greatest country singer in history, is exactly what happens when you add Ernest Tubbs' new singing style and Roy Acuff's voice together.
POD1000000018_S0000096	You just heard some Ernest. Here's a little Roy Acuff from 1942.
POD1000000018_S0000098	Now George Jones would have told you Hank Williams was his favorite singer. You don't get Hank without Ernest and Roy. I've seen Lefty Frazell named as an influence on George.
POD1000000018_S0000099	Lefty borrowed from Ernest as well. However you want to say we got to George Jones, it always comes back to Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb.
POD1000000018_S0000100	Now the part of earnest you can hear in George is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you'd expect, picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the first time.
POD1000000018_S0000101	no matter if it's a song you've heard performed by other people.
POD1000000018_S0000102	Here's George in 1956 doing his own composition, just one more.
POD1000000018_S0000104	Both versions of the song are great.
POD1000000018_S0000106	It's possible Ernest really didn't like his new voice. About a million people disagree with his opinion. He had that tonsillectomy in 1939.
POD1000000018_S0000107	In 1940, he had his biggest hit, Walking the Floor Over You. This song is still synonymous with the name Ernest Hubb.
POD1000000018_S0000108	If someone only knows one Ernest Tubbs song, it's usually this song.
POD1000000018_S0000109	We'd like to introduce a man who has become a legend in his own time.
POD1000000018_S0000110	ET was finally big time.
POD1000000018_S0000111	the Texas troubadour, Ernest Tubbs.
POD1000000018_S0000114	He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1943 and formed the first incarnation of the Texas Troubadours.
POD1000000018_S0000115	Tubb would stay working for the rest of his life so members of the Texas Troubadours would be replaced every now and then.
POD1000000018_S0000116	Buddy Emmons, Jack Green, Billy Bird, Leon Rhodes, and Cal Smith are only some of the notable players who joined the band on their way up the ladder.
POD1000000018_S0000118	This was the first way Ernest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand Kerry Rogers had held out to him.
POD1000000018_S0000119	Your dad made all those guys household names.
POD1000000018_S0000120	Yes, he did.
POD1000000018_S0000121	Justin Tubb
POD1000000018_S0000122	He was the first one to call names out on records and he loved doing that. He loved the guys and they were a big part of his show. I mean, and he wanted to make sure they got the credit for it.
POD1000000018_S0000123	And so he started calling their names out when they took a course. But he was never jealous of anybody in his band outshining him. He didn't mind that at all, as he proved with Jack Green and Cal Smith.
POD1000000018_S0000124	And of course he had the Wilberts with him for a while and Skeeter worked some dates with him, George Jones, Stonewall Jackson, and he was always pushing them. And he, like Roy I think, understood that the bigger they became, the bigger he became.
POD1000000018_S0000125	George Jones and Stonewall Jackson were never Texas Troubadours. Justin meant E.T. took those guys out on tour with him as opening acts to help them build their own following. And often, he did a lot more than that.
POD1000000018_S0000126	Yeah, I don't have many but but I have one earnest
POD1000000018_S0000127	Johnny Paycheck
POD1000000018_S0000129	Ernest, one time I was hanging around the streets and it was snowing and Buddy Emmons took me on the meeting. I always wanted to meet him.
POD1000000018_S0000130	And I had met him, but I mean I wanted to sit and talk with him. And they was getting ready to go on tour and I didn't have anywhere to stay, you know. I was at that stage in my life.
POD1000000018_S0000131	And evidently Buddy had told him that.
POD1000000018_S0000132	the colors. We got on, he said, I talked to him a while, I was, you know, and he said, well it's about time to leave. He said, yeah.
POD1000000018_S0000133	He said, are you working? Asked me if I was working. I said, no. He said, you are now. He was going on like 10 days out in Texas and it was snowing here in Nashville and I had nowhere to, you know, I just, I was in that place where I was, you know.
POD1000000018_S0000134	He took me on the road, wound up giving me a suit, I didn't have nothing to wear, so he gave me one of his old suits and took it to the cleaners and I'd had it cut down the first date we got in Texas.
POD1000000018_S0000135	And it was so... there was two pockets in the back, that's how much I had to take out. But it was a... and I still got a picture of me in that suit.
POD1000000018_S0000136	And he let me go out and I opened his show for him for 10 days. And he fed me and at the end of the tour gave me some money. So that's the kind of guy he was.
POD1000000018_S0000138	You can't tell the Hank Snow story without talking about Ernest Tubb. E.T. told Johnny Cash not to smile when he performed Folsom Prison Blues so people in the audience could really feel the song.
POD1000000018_S0000139	Cash never forgot the advice. Hank Williams Sr. was heavily influenced by Ernest Music, and Ernest is the one who convinced the Grand Ole Opry to bring Hank back after his first failed audition.
POD1000000018_S0000140	E.T. got Hank to promise he wouldn't touch any booze for three months to swing that one.
POD1000000018_S0000141	In 1947, enough radio listeners wrote letters complaining of not being able to find his music that he launched the Ernest Tubb Record Shop in Nashville. If you couldn't make it there in person, they'd ship records directly to you.
POD1000000018_S0000142	It was a game changer for country music fans and would help keep the music alive when rock and roll steamrolled America in the 50s.
POD1000000018_S0000144	The record shop operated at a loss of $10,000 a year for the first two years it was open, but Ernest knew how important it was and he kept it alive.
POD1000000018_S0000145	The Opry was a great promotional tool for him and he'd started his own show on WSM in the following time slot. When the Opry was over, fans could stay tuned in for the Midnight Jamboree.
POD1000000018_S0000147	Ernest played host to Opry stars and newcomers alike, making sure to remind you this music was available for mail order from Ernest Tubbs' record shop. He took the chance to keep Jimmy Rogers' memory alive, pitching his records as well.
POD1000000018_S0000149	Ernest never grew out of his fascination with Jimmy Rogers and never stopped repaying his debt to Jimmy's widow, Carrie. Jimmy's death had left Carrie in a pretty bad financial situation, but she still got money from the sales of his records, which were declining.
POD1000000018_S0000150	He realized the more Jimmy Rogers records sold, the better off Carrier would be, so E.T. pushed those records as hard as he could.
POD1000000018_S0000151	Carey loaned and eventually flat-out gave him that guitar of Jimmy's, which is why you'll frequently see pictures or videos of Ernest Tubb playing a guitar that says Jimmy Rogers on it.
POD1000000018_S0000152	In 1953, Ernest helped found the Jimmy Rogers Memorial Festival in Rogers' hometown of Meridian, Mississippi. That's a stand-up guy.
POD1000000018_S0000154	You can find plenty of people who will say the same thing about Jim Denny.
POD1000000018_S0000155	Remember Jim, poor kid from Tennessee, worked his way up from the mailroom to become Director of Artist Services at WSM and Manager of the Grand Ole Opry.
POD1000000018_S0000156	Director of Artist Services was a fancy way of saying he booked the musical acts that played on the radio station as well as the Opry.
POD1000000018_S0000157	Denny was a powerful man in Nashville and he acted like he knew it.
POD1000000018_S0000158	Where Ernest Tubb built a reputation for helping young musicians, Jim Denny had a reputation for acting like a dick.
POD1000000018_S0000160	The Johnny Cash ET gave advice to is the same Johnny Cash who had to wait two hours outside Denny's office.
POD1000000018_S0000162	Jim Denny might not have been a dick. He could have simply been a businessman who paid more attention to the bottom line than how many friends he had.
POD1000000018_S0000163	Denny's the guy who had to be convinced to let Hank Sr. onto the Opry, and he's the guy who called Hank to fire him over the telephone. But Ernest Tubb was standing in Denny's office when that phone call was made.
POD1000000018_S0000164	He said he saw tears in Jim's eyes.
POD1000000018_S0000165	Hank had missed a scheduled Opry appearance, most likely for no good reason other than that he was drunk. Denny said he thought firing Hank would make him realize he needed to get his act together.
POD1000000018_S0000166	That's not what happened. Hank Williams died four months after being dismissed from the Opry. It's tragic, but you can see how Jim Denney thought he was doing the right thing in that situation.
POD1000000018_S0000167	This is important to recognize because the year Hank Williams died is the same year that Jim Denny formed Cedarwood Publishing with Webb Pierce.
POD1000000018_S0000169	If you don't know what a publishing company is, it used to be the heart of the record industry. On the surface, a publishing company's purpose was to make sure sales royalties were going to the right place.
POD1000000018_S0000170	They took a big percentage to do this, so anything that could be done to make a hit out of one of their writers' songs, they'd do it. And if they forgot to send you your whole royalty check sometimes, well, shit happens.
POD1000000018_S0000172	Roy Acuff and Fred Rose had started Acuff-Rose Music back in 1942.
POD1000000018_S0000173	So many country writers were being screwed over by publishing companies based out of other cities that there needed to be one in Nashville, an honest publishing company run by country artists for country artists.
POD1000000018_S0000174	They were the best game in town until Jim Denny formed Cedarwood in 53.
POD1000000018_S0000175	As head of artist services at WSM and manager of the Grand Ole Opry, Jim Denney controlled who got to play in the Opry, their place in the lineup, and how long they got to play.
POD1000000018_S0000176	Can you see where this is headed?
POD1000000018_S0000178	If Jim Denny owns a country music publishing firm while retaining singular control of the most popular country music radio program in America, then he's essentially printing his own money.
POD1000000018_S0000180	Once he's got a writer signed to Cedarwood, then he's getting a huge piece of any money their songs make. If that writer also wants to be a performer, congratulations, you're on the Grand Ole Opry tonight.
POD1000000018_S0000181	If the writer doesn't want to be your performer, congratulations! Webb Pierce is the biggest star on the Opry and he's playing your song on the Grand Ole Opry tonight.
POD1000000018_S0000182	Roy Acuff was pissed off and he didn't stay quiet about it. He said Denny was giving the best spots to his own artists. Artists signed to Acuff Rose had a tendency to see Roy's point.
POD1000000018_S0000183	Artist signed to Cedarwood had a tendency to think Jim Denny wasn't doing anything wrong. Weird, huh?
POD1000000018_S0000184	Long story short, in 1956, WSM fired Jim Denny over his conflicts of interest.
POD1000000018_S0000186	He started a booking agency and signed most of the Opry artists, some of whom had resigned when Denny was fired. Then, Denny contacted the Philip Morris Tobacco Company.
POD1000000018_S0000187	Their competition in the cigarette business, R.J. Reynolds, was a sponsor of the Grand Ole Opry.
POD1000000018_S0000188	So, when Jim Denny called with a chance for them to get their product associated with all those acts, Philip Morris wrote a check big enough to fund the biggest country music package tour anyone had ever seen.
POD1000000018_S0000189	Half the Grand Ole Opry lineup these fans listened to every Saturday night was coming to stages across America for live appearances.
POD1000000018_S0000190	With Philip Morris paying for everything, the admission was even free.
POD1000000018_S0000191	It looked as though everyone was getting what they wanted, until the Philip Morris Country Music Show booked a stop in Meridian, Mississippi on the same week as the fifth annual Jimmy Rogers Memorial Festival.
POD1000000018_S0000192	But it was worse. The Philip Morris Show would take place on the second night of the two-day Jimmy Rogers Festival.
POD1000000018_S0000194	For five years, Ernest Tubb had worked to grow the Jimmy Rogers Festival from scratch. This is a tremendously difficult thing to do. E.T. put in the effort to honor his idol.
POD1000000018_S0000196	Jim Denny wasn't simply setting up shop across the street with some healthy competition.
POD1000000018_S0000197	He brought a free show to town on the same night with half the Grand Ole Opry lineup and several big names you would have had to buy a ticket to see on the Jimmy Rogers event the previous night.
POD1000000018_S0000198	It's hard not to see that as a giant middle finger. Can you imagine what would happen if Coachella set up a festival 8 miles away from Bonnaroo on the same weekend for free?
POD1000000018_S0000199	It would crush Bonnaroo. This was such a big deal that they didn't even have the Jimmy Rogers Memorial Festival the following year.
POD1000000018_S0000200	They regrouped to put one on again in 1959, but Kerry Rogers' health had already taken a turn for the worse, and Ernest Tubb was never involved with the festival again.
POD1000000018_S0000202	Mostly a kind man, E.T. was different when he'd been drinking. A beer or two while gambling with the guys, he'd be fine. But it was the times when he'd get to drinking for a whole day, or two, or five.
POD1000000018_S0000203	Mirrors would get smashed, windows broken. He had a thing about glass, apparently.
POD1000000018_S0000205	According to Billy Bird, Ernest Tubbs' reaction to the Philip Morris Country Music Show undercutting the Jimmy Rogers Memorial Festival was to get drunk and stay drunk for the better part of a week.
POD1000000018_S0000206	They carted him back to Nashville, but he was still drinking and he was still mad as hell at Jim Denny.
POD1000000018_S0000207	Finally, he called Denny at home in the middle of the night to cuss him out. Denny said something like, well, if you're so mad about it, then how about you just meet me down at WSM right now and we'll settle things for good.
POD1000000018_S0000209	That sounded like a great plan to earn his tub. He strapped on a gun belt with bullets and a .357 Magnum in the holster and drove downtown in his Cadillac wearing house slippers.
POD1000000018_S0000210	Meanwhile, when Jim Denny had hung up the phone, he simply took it back off the hook again so Ernest couldn't call him anymore and then went back to sleep.
POD1000000018_S0000212	So Ernest Tubb is drunk off his ass with a loaded gun when he stumbles into the lobby of the National Life Building where WSM was located.
POD1000000018_S0000213	It's close to 530 in the morning. People are starting to show up for work.
POD1000000018_S0000215	There's more than one version of what happened next. The gun gets fired in all of them.
POD1000000018_S0000217	Bill Williams, the news director at WSM, says he was walking into work when a gunshot rang out in the lobby and a bullet went over his head into the wall.
POD1000000018_S0000218	He turned around, you know, pretty scared and saw Ernest Hupp standing there in his house slippers with a revolver
POD1000000018_S0000220	When he asked Ernest what the hell he was doing, Ernest said, My God, I've shot the wrong man.
POD1000000018_S0000221	Whether or not he'd been actively trying to kill anyone, we will never know for certain. It seems to me like he thought he had successfully shot someone and was only upset that someone wasn't Jim Denny.
POD1000000018_S0000222	Either way, Ernest settled down after thinking he'd shot an innocent person. Bill Williams called his boss, Jack DeWitt, to tell him what happened. Jack told Bill to take Ernest home.
POD1000000018_S0000223	He would have, except the police had been called as soon as other employees heard a gunshot in the office building.
POD1000000018_S0000225	Ernest Hubb went to jail for drunken disorderly plus carrying the weapon.
POD1000000018_S0000226	It was mandatory to hold public intoxication arrestees for three hours.
POD1000000018_S0000227	So Ernest bought cigarettes for all the other inmates and sang songs with them while Bill Williams waited to take him home.
POD1000000018_S0000229	$60 bond got him out and that was the end of that.
POD1000000018_S0000231	Jim Denny's name was kept out of the papers, though everyone in the business could read between the lines and see who Ernest had wanted to shoot.
POD1000000018_S0000233	the incident seems to have had no effect on Ernest Hub's career whatsoever. Apparently, if all E.T. was trying to do was put a bullet in Jim Denny, then that was fine.
POD1000000018_S0000235	His career lasted into the 1980s. He was still doing over 200 dates on the road a year, and he only quit in 1982 because of problems from his emphysema.
POD1000000018_S0000236	In 1984, his lungs killed him just like his hero, Jimmy Rogers.
POD1000000018_S0000238	The Midnight Jamboree still airs every Saturday night and you can still buy music from Ernest Hubs Record Shop or online at etrecordshop.com
POD1000000018_S0000240	We're told that in 1963, Ernest Tubb made up with Jim Denny before Jim passed away from cancer. The Jim Denny Artist Bureau stayed in business for only a few more years.
POD1000000018_S0000242	Jim Denny was inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1966. Cedarwood, Jim Denny's publishing company, was sold to Mel Tillis in 1983.
POD1000000018_S0000243	Ernest Tubb had been inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1965 while he was still alive.
POD1000000018_S0000245	Thank you for listening to the first episode of Cocaine and Rhinestones. I hope you liked it, and I promise I'll get a lot better at doing this.
POD1000000018_S0000246	Wherever you listen to this, it would be huge for me if you could share this episode with just one person. If you're listening on iTunes or Stitcher, then I'm told that getting reviews is really important, so I guess please give me a review.
POD1000000018_S0000247	Be nice. Every episode of Cocaine and Rhinestones is written and produced by me, Tyler Mahan Co.
POD1000000018_S0000248	Each episode also has a companion blog post at cocaineandrhinestones.com. Go check that out for links to the books I read, the video clips I watched, and the music I talked about in the episode.
POD1000000018_S0000250	Before I get to the liner notes segment of the post show, you can email any questions you have about this episode or the podcast or me or life in general to questions at cocaineandrinestones.com.
POD1000000018_S0000251	If enough people send in questions, then I'll make a Q&A episode to close out the first season. Alright, liner notes.
POD1000000018_S0000252	Okay, first of all, if I didn't make it clear, it is impossible to overstate Ernest Tubbs' importance to country music.
POD1000000018_S0000253	Aside from influencing basically everyone who matters, he was one of the first, if not in fact the first artist, to bring an electric guitar player with him onto the Grand Ole Opry stage.
POD1000000018_S0000254	If you want to call it honky-tonk, and it happened after Ernest Tubb, it was influenced by Ernest Tubb. Before I get to the story in the episode, I'd like to address one other thing.
POD1000000018_S0000255	In the 1980s, Clyde Moody tried to start an alternative association to the Country Music Hall of Fame called the Country Music Pioneer Association.
POD1000000018_S0000256	The CMPA had a trashy newspaper that Clyde essentially used to rant against the industry and print whatever shitty rumors people sent in.
POD1000000018_S0000257	Among these rumors was one that Ernest Tubb died broke and alone in a cheap downtown motel. Shunned by the country music world, he'd done so much to help.
POD1000000018_S0000258	This rumor is still spread as fact and I do not believe it's true.
POD1000000018_S0000259	Charlie Leuven even has it in his autobiography, which isn't the only thing Charlie got wrong in that book, but I'll talk about that another time.
POD1000000018_S0000260	First of all, the source was Ernest Tubbs estranged wife. Next, Ernest died owning 70% of the Ernest Tubbs record shop which had multiple locations running and was very profitable at that time. He was not a broke man.
POD1000000018_S0000261	That's just, that's not realistic.
POD1000000018_S0000262	I believe Ernest chose to turn visitors away because he was wasting away of emphysema and didn't want anyone who loved him to have that as their last memory of him.
POD1000000018_S0000263	I don't remember who it was, but someone actually did get in to see him and they point blank said they wish they had not gone to see him.
POD1000000018_S0000264	they could tell he was uncomfortable about it and they were uncomfortable about it and they don't like having that be their last memory of him. So he was trying to avoid that.
POD1000000018_S0000265	And I think Justin said that people would go, would try to see Ernest and he would tell Justin to tell them thank you, but he'd rather not have the company.
POD1000000018_S0000266	So, you know, I mean, the end, I don't think that Ernest Hubb died, you know, in a sad state of affairs. I think that he did.
POD1000000018_S0000268	I think he did a lot for country music and I think he went out the way that he wanted to go, it seems like to me. Okay, back to Ernest Hubbard and Jim Denney.
POD1000000018_S0000269	What about this story, right? Was that crazy? It's just so many things. The roots of country music are just growing all over this story. You got Jim Denny showing up right as the Grand Ole Opry is becoming a thing.
POD1000000018_S0000270	Ernest Hobbes gets in there and his throat is broken so he can't do what he wanted to do his whole life which is imitate his hero.
POD1000000018_S0000271	And then his throat gets broken, and so now he's gotta create this new thing, and he ends up influencing fucking Hank Williams Sr. and like everyone. That is, that's crazy. It's amazing. I love this story.
POD1000000018_S0000272	I won't even try to pretend to remember the first time I heard this story, it gets around, you know.
POD1000000018_S0000273	At least the part about earnest of getting drunk and going down to the radio station with a gun and shooting and firing off around the wall you know,
POD1000000018_S0000274	People always bring that up as an example of how wild and crazy these old guys were. Everybody laughs about Ernest getting hauled off to jail and ultimately getting away with causing a little bit of trouble, you know, up boys will be boys.
POD1000000018_S0000275	And nobody ever seemed to know why it happened. And that's all I ever really wanted to know. People would tell you the story and just like, well, why did he do that? Well, I don't know. Who cares? It's just funny. It's like, well, I wanted to know. So I found out.
POD1000000018_S0000276	Thanks to Ronnie Pugh's very well done biography on Ernest Hubb, that finally had the story for me. And the big Jimmy Rogers festival thing, why that affected Ernest so deeply, that was in there.
POD1000000018_S0000277	The most detailed account of Bill Williams' version of the lobby shooting was in there.
POD1000000018_S0000278	I went with Bill's version because A. he was the news director of WSM with a reputation for being able to throw away that day's news script and ad-lib the news without making a mistake.
POD1000000018_S0000279	And B, he was the one right in the middle of it. He called his boss at home, he went with Ernest to the jail. Shout out Jim Farney. Everyone else just seemed like a bystander trying to get their name involved.
POD1000000018_S0000280	Like a security guard saying that he told Ernest to put the gun away and Ernest fired it off to dare the security guard or whatever, you know, I mean.
POD1000000018_S0000281	No offense if you're a security guard, but I've hung out with a lot of security guards and y'all are full of shit. So I'm going with the news director guy.
POD1000000018_S0000282	Also, I'm aware there are different revisionist history type opinions about how well Elvis Presley's debut on the Grand Ole Opry did or didn't go.
POD1000000018_S0000283	My thing is he didn't get an encore you know that is a fact he didn't get an encore he was a special guest and special guest almost always get an encore so the fact that he didn't get one.
POD1000000018_S0000284	I'm going with it wasn't good. You know, I don't think it, I don't think it was good. You know.
POD1000000018_S0000285	I've seen every year from 1924 to 1929 cited as the year of Denny being hired at the parent company of WSM, the life insurance company. I don't really care what year he exactly was.
POD1000000018_S0000286	There was a biography of Johnny Cash that quoted a Rolling Stone interview with Johnny talking about Jim Denny making him wait outside his office for two hours.
POD1000000018_S0000287	Larry Jordan's biography on Jim Reeves had a bunch of great information on the Jim Denny Opry scandal. I found a Billboard magazine from 1956 reporting that Philip Morris paid over $400,000 for the talent on that first package tour.
POD1000000018_S0000288	That is a mind-boggling number. 1956, $400,000.
POD1000000018_S0000289	For probably, I don't know, eight, 10, probably 10 acts on the bill. That's just, that's bananas.
POD1000000018_S0000291	I'm gonna say this guy's last name wrong Craig have a hearse having hearse I don't know he wrote a book on the history of WSM called.
POD1000000018_S0000293	Called Air Castle, it's a really good book, it's just a massive subject, you know, the history of WSM, there's so much there.
POD1000000018_S0000294	I know I'm going to keep coming back to this book for future episodes. A lot of what I got out of that for this was about Denny's firing because pretty much everywhere else you hear people talk about Denny getting fired.
POD1000000018_S0000295	They're all like, yeah, I don't know. It was just like weird. No one really knows why he got fired. Or you've got artists who were with Cedarwood saying Jim Denny got railroaded.
POD1000000018_S0000296	You've got artists who were with Akof Rose saying Danny was corrupt and he had to get out of there, you know. So this WSM book was really good just to find out straight up what happened.
POD1000000018_S0000298	I mentioned that Hank Sr. was heavily influenced by Ernest Tubb, but also some of the most charming stuff I've ever read about Hank is the way he acted around Ernest.
POD1000000018_S0000299	You know, they were peers, they were contemporaries. Hank was influenced by him, but then he, you know, got to come to the show.
POD1000000018_S0000300	and be a part of the big time. And you just get the idea that he was just like a kid in a candy store around Ernest Tubb. You get the idea that he just really loved being around this guy and he couldn't help messing with him. He was always screwing with Ernest.
POD1000000018_S0000301	Ernest Hub song walking the floor over you Hank Williams took that image of walking the floor and put it in your cheating heart you know you walk the floor like i do.
POD1000000018_S0000302	And he had a monster hit with it. And he just couldn't leave Ernest alone about it. Just like, hey, Ernest, what do you think about that? I stole that image from you. I got your image, boy. Just that kind of shit.
POD1000000018_S0000303	That clip of Justin Tubb talking and the clip of Johnny Paycheck talking are both from the Country Family Reunion DVDs, which are pretty much all amazing if you've never seen those.
POD1000000018_S0000304	I think it's bill anderson that host them there's gotta be twenty of them in a series they've always got different old school people on their sitting around talking telling stories.
POD1000000018_S0000305	Just, I mean, if you see one, any of the ones with Grandpa Jones, any of the ones with Grandpa Jones or Little Jimmy Dickens on them are fucking hilarious. You've got to see them. Just.
POD1000000018_S0000307	just clowns, just everyone's just clowning on each other. And we're talking like people old enough to be your grandparents just clowning on each other harder than you ever did in college. It's great.
POD1000000018_S0000309	There's a book called Andy and Dawn with the confirmation of Percy Foreman inspiring Matlock.
POD1000000018_S0000310	Percy is no longer alive and his New York Times obituary had some other interesting information that I did not know.
POD1000000018_S0000311	Like Jack Ruby asked Percy Foreman to defend him after shooting Lee Harvey Oswald, but then there was this communication error like
POD1000000018_S0000312	Jack Ruby's people told Jack that Foreman wanted like five times as much money as he'd ever asked from anyone or something. So he was like, well, screw that. I'll go someone else.
POD1000000018_S0000313	And Foreman like seemed disappointed that he didn't get that case. So I guess he wanted that. But Foreman did represent Martin Luther King Jr's assassin, James Earl Ray.
POD1000000018_S0000314	But only long enough to convince him to plead guilty. So yeah, James did not get away with that.
POD1000000018_S0000316	Oh yeah, the Texas defense thing. I have spent a lot of time in Texas and this defense thing is so effective there
POD1000000018_S0000317	that I went into this episode with the understanding that that was actually a law, like that's a statute on the books in Texas.
POD1000000018_S0000318	People who've lived in Texas their whole lives believe they live in a state with a law called the He Needed Killing Law. And I know that because these people have told me that.
POD1000000018_S0000319	And yeah, I always just thought it was a law in Texas. Like you can straight up murder a motherfucker if they deserve it. You know, if they've got it coming.
POD1000000018_S0000320	You shoot them, they're dead, he needed killin', this is still the wild west, don't mess with Texas.
POD1000000018_S0000321	It was only after uncovering the Percy Foreman-Matlock connection that I learned that it was really just a legal defense strategy that works so incredibly well there, it may as well be a law.
POD1000000018_S0000323	It's pretty intense.
POD1000000018_S0000325	I think that's it. Oh, next week, if you're listening to this early, I'm just putting this up on the website. And if you happen to listen to it early.
POD1000000018_S0000326	Then next week i'm going to be talking about loretta lynn's song the pill it's about the birth control pill and it was banned from radio and i was looking into why and i found out a lot of really really interesting stuff you know thing.
POD1000000018_S0000327	The kind of stuff that no one's gonna be really surprised by, but when you hear the actual numbers on these stats,
POD1000000018_S0000328	It's crazy. It's really crazy. Definitely come back next week. Loretta Lynn, the pill.
POD1000000018_S0000330	See you there
POD1000000022_S0000000	Hello everyone, I'm Stephen West. This is Philosophize This. Thank you to everyone that supports the show on Patreon. And thank you to the people that don't support the show by going through the Amazon banner. You can find out more about both those things on the front page of philosophizethis.org.
POD1000000022_S0000001	Apologies for the voice and my lack of execution today. I'm just getting over a cold. But it had been too long since I had graced you with my voice. And I wanted to give you guys this. Today's episode is part six in a series on Sartre and Camus. I hope you love the show today.
POD1000000022_S0000003	So in a culture where there's so much social currency connected to being a victim and having some burden that you carry around with you throughout your life, there may be some of you out there that feel a little left out of all that. Maybe you're the kind of person, you look at yourself, you don't feel like a victim.
POD1000000022_S0000004	Maybe you don't sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past. Well enough of that crazy talk. Get off the bench. Because your Uncle Steve's putting you in the game. I'm here to tell you. Don't worry my friend. You are a victim. You really are.
POD1000000022_S0000005	Turns out we're all victims just by virtue of being born because just think for a second about how horrible the world was for us when we were all babies. Think of what it's like being a baby.
POD1000000022_S0000006	Imagine going through something similar today and if you made it on the other side, tell me you wouldn't be part of some sort of advocacy group for the people that are currently going through it. Think about it, you didn't choose to be born. Imagine being rounded up against your will and being rocketed off to some alien planet you know nothing about.
POD1000000022_S0000007	You find yourself once you get on that planet absorbed into some foreign tribe. You don't speak the language. You have no idea what anything is. You think the remote control of their TV is food. You're completely defenseless. And who do you have as teachers on this journey?
POD1000000022_S0000008	What just some random man and woman that happened to look like you didn't go to school for this stuff being a baby? Being a baby's like going to the world's worst community college. I don't even have teachers They just pull some random people off the street and say hey teach these kids about rocket science go
POD1000000022_S0000009	Except it's worse than that. We're not just learning about rocket science. We're learning everything about what it is to exist. How we look at other people, how we look at the world, how we look at ourselves within that world. What I'm saying is, the struggle for us former babies out here was real.
POD1000000022_S0000010	And I think it's safe to say that when you're living in the middle of this chaotic world as a baby just trying to figure things out, no one's really blaming you for just sort of going along with a lot of the ways people were doing things around you.
POD1000000022_S0000011	There's a lot to figure out and a lot of these ways we've learned to make sense of stuff are totally arbitrary a lot of the ways we think about stuff have just been sort of almost by accident passed down from generation to generation philosophers realized this
POD1000000022_S0000012	And at the time of Sartre, for over 300 years, people have been pointing out how many of the ways we look at things in the Western world are largely derivative from the way Christianity describes being a human being.
POD1000000022_S0000013	That's how entrenched religion was in the lives of people back then and that even if you've never been to church even if your family's 15 generations removed from ever having stepped foot in a church some of these things are so foundational that generation after generation of confused baby trying to figure things out is
POD1000000022_S0000014	Just went along with certain assumptions about existence that have their origins in Christianity for example There's a certain revelatory way that a lot of people look at important crossroads in life right like for example. They'll say
POD1000000022_S0000015	Okay, so I need to choose a career path for my life. I need to declare a major big decision. What do I do? Well, whenever I close my eyes and think about what I want, I honestly don't know what I want I can't make that big of a decision. Yeah, I've narrowed it down to a few things.
POD1000000022_S0000016	But how can I ever know?
POD1000000022_S0000018	I feel like I'm spending hours a day thinking about this stuff. I have faith it's going to come to me someday. I have faith that I'm going to wake up one day, something's going to happen to me, some life event is going to occur.
POD1000000022_S0000020	I'm going to realize my calling in life in that moment. People do the same thing with relationships. They'll say, I have this vague idea up in my head of my one and only someone. Don't know exactly what they look like, don't know exactly what they're going to be like, but I'm confident. One day I'm going to meet someone.
POD1000000022_S0000021	And there's going to be this moment when I look at them and I realize they're the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. People do this with anything. They'll do it with motivational videos on YouTube. One day I'm going to watch the right person screaming at me to be a better person.
POD1000000022_S0000022	and from then on out it's going to be easy for me to go to the gym and eat pine cones for the rest of my life. In other words, there's a certain revelatory way that some people look at life choices that some thinkers believe is a long lost relic of the revelatory way we used to think about the nature of existence.
POD1000000022_S0000023	that a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life is that one day you're gonna wake up and there's gonna be some event, some miracle that you witness, some transcendent moment where you realize the divinity of Jesus.
POD1000000022_S0000024	If you have any further questions about the nature of existence, just forward them to the Pope's inbox. That's a reasonable thing to expect in that worldview. Well, this isn't the only example of these long-lost remnants of Christianity in our thinking.
POD1000000022_S0000025	And another major one, another one that a lot of people in today's world still use to make sense of things, is the way that they look at themselves and who they are. Just like in Christianity, where yes, you have a body, but your true self is a soul.
POD1000000022_S0000026	It's an eternal spirit hidden deep down within that body that you have an intimate access to. Just like that, a lot of people in today's world think of their true self or the answer to the question, who are you as a personality hidden deep within us that only we and our closest friends have access to.
POD1000000022_S0000027	You know, they'll say things like, sure, when I'm out in public, I do kind of put on a mask to other people for the sake of social utility. I mean, I don't act like my 100% true self in the Starbucks drive-thru.
POD1000000022_S0000028	Yeah, I tell people things they want to hear. I play the game because look, the fact is it's just not useful to.
POD1000000022_S0000029	Not to mention, I don't really feel comfortable giving 100% of my true self to the person in the Starbucks drive-thru. Who am I really though? Well, that's something I reserve for my family and my closest friends. In fact, even some of my closest friends don't know everything about the depths of what it is to be me.
POD1000000022_S0000030	Maybe for some of you out there, there's only one other person in this entire world that has full access to your true self hidden deep within you. But Sartre would say, is this really how the self works?
POD1000000022_S0000031	Is the self really like the Christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to? Sartre would say, it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go out in public for the sake of pragmatism. And it very well may be that you've reflected on yourself.
POD1000000022_S0000032	and you have this idea up in your head of who you are that's only accessed by you and your closest friends. But don't ignore the possibility that there are multiple levels of deception going on there. Maybe you're telling yourself a story you want to hear the same way you're telling the Starbucks barista story.
POD1000000022_S0000033	This concept is a common one in existentialism. It's actually one of the main themes in Dostoevsky's book Crime and Punishments. The idea that, you know, we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do in practice. Two examples of this.
POD1000000022_S0000034	Bear with me for a second on the first one, it's a little cartoonish, but I think it's a really good example to pull us out of this conditioned way we often look at the self, and it gets us to honestly start asking this question, where is this self that we're talking about really located?
POD1000000022_S0000035	First example, imagine a guy that thinks he's Napoleon. He spends all day, every day, dressing up in Parisian military garb. He builds a bunker out of couch cushions in his front room, agonizing to himself, how am I going to conquer Moscow?
POD1000000022_S0000036	That guy now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is Napoleon if you sat him down And you asked him candidly no, but who are you really deep down inside? He would say I'm Napoleon Bonaparte commander the armies of the north
POD1000000022_S0000037	Husband to a murdered wife, father to a murdered son, and I will have my vengeance. But is this man really Napoleon? We know he's not Napoleon. In fact, in a weird way, as outsiders, we seem to have an advantage when it comes to knowing who he really is.
POD1000000022_S0000038	Interesting. Here's the less cartoonish example and try to think about how this applies to you. Imagine a guy sitting on the couch watching TV with his pals. They turn on the news and there's a story about some mass shooting that happened at a Walmart somewhere.
POD1000000022_S0000039	He hears the story, gets kinda angry, turns to his friends and says, you know what? That guy and people like him, they better hope they never show up at my Walmart. Someone pull out a gun when I'm there. I'm not gonna be one of those people on the news chopper camera screaming and running out of the store.
POD1000000022_S0000040	I'm going to the sporting goods section. I mean, I'm gonna go up into the rafters like I'm Tom Cruise and snap the dude's neck. I'm going to do this because that's just the kind of person I am. That's me. I'd sacrifice my life for the greater good. Now he may tell his friends this.
POD1000000022_S0000041	He may believe that that's who he is deep down beyond a shadow of a doubt. But if next Saturday he's out shopping with his family, someone pulls out a gun and all his wife and kids see is a poof of smoke and then he's running out the back door, who is that guy really?
POD1000000022_S0000042	In other words, when we reference this thing we call ourself, intuitively it can feel like, well, I am myself, I know who I am, so no one can tell me who I am but me.
POD1000000022_S0000043	In fact, if you just recited that statement in most public settings, people would be like, yeah, yeah, you tell him only, you know, who you are deep down inside. But is that a delusion? Is that just a narrative that we tell ourselves to simplify this concept of the self?
POD1000000022_S0000044	Sartre says that when you take a closer look at the self, it's not a soul, it's not a personality hidden deep within you. What we're referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with many more moving parts.
POD1000000022_S0000045	And I think a good place to begin if we want to understand Sartre's views on what the self really is, is to talk about two foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that to Sartre seem to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other. What he calls our facticity,
POD1000000022_S0000046	and our transcendence. If you are a human being that's alive right now, you have both facticity and transcendence. Put very simply, our facticity is the collection of facts that are true about us at any given moment.
POD1000000022_S0000047	And transcendence is our ability to change, the possibilities that we have at our disposal. Let's break it down further though. Remember last time when we talked about being in itself versus being for itself? Being in itself is being kind of like matter, this inert, featureless blob of existence.
POD1000000022_S0000048	fully affirmative and being for itself as being consciousness or the source of all negation. Well, one day when Sartre's trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions, the way he describes the relationship between these two ontological categories is that being in itself,
POD1000000022_S0000049	quote, is what it is, and being for itself, quote, is what it is not. Well, as weird as that sounds in a vacuum, after listening to last episode, we all know what he means when he says it. But then Sartre points out something very mysterious, a very strange coincidence.
POD1000000022_S0000050	When you look at the relationship between these two ontological categories, two things that are easy to write off as just these meaningless abstract concepts that start to cook up one day. When you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to each other,
POD1000000022_S0000051	Sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people. See, because on one hand, all of us have our facticity. And facticity is kind of like being in itself. It's the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us.
POD1000000022_S0000052	You ask me who I am, and oftentimes I will state the facts about myself. Oh, I am 117 years old. That's a fact. I am a horse wrangler by profession. That's a fact. I make $28,000 a year. I drive a Ford Focus.
POD1000000022_S0000053	I'm scared of spiders, things like that. In other words, statements of facts that are currently true about us. That's what makes up our facticity. But what Sartre would want us to consider is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who I am,
POD1000000022_S0000054	They never tell us the full story. And the reason why is because human beings are far more complex than that. To fully understand a human being just by default is to understand a type of being that has possibilities. None of us are pure facticity, in other words.
POD1000000022_S0000055	The only time a human being is pure facticity is when they're dead. Yes, we have a set of facts that are true about us right now, but we always have the ability to change into something else. And if we're trying to describe the self, if we're trying to look at the whole picture of who someone is,
POD1000000022_S0000056	The choices we make about which of these possibilities we're going to bring about end up being just as important as the facts about who we are right now. For example, if I'm going to school to become an IT consultant, or if I'm training for a marathon, or if I'm losing a bunch of weight for wedding pictures,
POD1000000022_S0000057	A big part of understanding who I am is understanding the thing I'm actively trying to change into, an IT consultant, a marathon runner. In other words, part of understanding the full picture of me is understanding what I am not yet.
POD1000000022_S0000058	You can start to hear the weird Sartre description creeping in there. Just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not. In a sense, I am what I am. I have a facticity. But I also am what I am not yet.
POD1000000022_S0000059	when I consider my transcendence. Just like being in itself and being for itself, these two aspects of what it is to be a human being, facticity and transcendence, are entangled, intertwined, and in some cases reliant on each other for their very existence.
POD1000000022_S0000060	Your facticity and transcendence are constantly affecting each other. And that's because the facts of your life are oftentimes caused by what possibilities you decide to bring about, and the possibilities you've decided to explore are almost always limited by the facts of your life.
POD1000000022_S0000061	Let's stop at the hypotheticals and just give a real example. Me. I'll use me as an example. I am six feet tall, 172.2 pounds this morning. Now, no matter how much I want to,
POD1000000022_S0000062	I am never going to become a horse jockey. It's just not going to happen for me. As long as there's people out there that are 4 foot 8, 85 pounds, the facticity that I'm a certain height and weight limits my ability to transcend. And the result of that is
POD1000000022_S0000063	I've never won in the Kentucky Derby. It's not happening. This is an example of how our ability to transcend is oftentimes limited by the facts about us. Another example, I was born with a particular face and a particular ability to put on muscle.
POD1000000022_S0000064	No matter how much I want to, I am never going to be an Instagram model. The facticity of my face, my faceticity, and all the other stuff going on there.
POD1000000022_S0000065	Look, I will never be the kind of person that people want to voluntarily look at and then click an emoji that signifies how they're feeling about the most recent picture of me. This is not going to happen. And these facts about me are the parameters I live my life and exercise my freedom within. See, because that's the thing, and this goes for all you out there.
POD1000000022_S0000066	When Sartre talks about radical freedom, when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose, we're never talking about total freedom, right? It's always freedom within certain limitations.
POD1000000022_S0000067	You know, we often say things like, I can do whatever I want to do, but you can't really do anything you want to do. Right? I mean, ultimately, you're a human being. You can't wrap yourself in a protective cocoon and then emerge a unicorn in three days. You can't fly to the edge of the universe and look at what's on the other side.
POD1000000022_S0000068	No, freedom is always freedom within certain limitations. And it's those limitations that give a lot of what you choose to do in life its value. We see this in all the various different forms of art. You know, when someone writes a really good haiku,
POD1000000022_S0000069	We see it as good not because they're the greatest words that could have ever been possibly strung together. No, the beauty of a haiku is because we understand that we've given an artist total freedom within a set of limitations that we impose.
POD1000000022_S0000070	5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables, go. In other words, the limitations are a big part of what makes the haiku beautiful. And this applies to life as well.
POD1000000022_S0000071	The facticity that you were born into, your own individual limitations, are always going to affect the possibilities that you have and what you ultimately choose to do with your life. So try to live your life like it's a piece of art you're creating.
POD1000000022_S0000072	But yeah, ultimately the point Sartre's making here with the concepts of facticity and transcendence is not only to stop thinking about yourself as though it's this artifact hidden deep within you inside of a vault, but also stop thinking about who you are as though it's this static
POD1000000022_S0000073	unchanging thing that you can point to. The point that he's making is that who you are is always in a state of constant change. Sometimes small changes, sometimes bigger changes, but changing and in flux. But don't go extreme in the other direction.
POD1000000022_S0000074	Don't start thinking of yourself as this ethereal thing that can never be defined. Again, all the way up until the day you die, when you're finally turned into total facticity, you will always have certain facts that are true about you and certain possibilities at your disposal to bring about.
POD1000000022_S0000075	Unless if you're dead, you've never arrived at a destination as a human being. Now at first glance this may seem like Sartre's writing a self-help book. No, no single fact about you sums up who you are. Release your inner transcendence. No.
POD1000000022_S0000076	No, like we touched on last time, Sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities they're free to choose from, most of the time they don't get excited. They're horrified by it. In fact, most of the time, once people realize this stuff,
POD1000000022_S0000077	Sartre thinks that the secret, covert desire of everyone, whether they realize it or not, is to escape this duality. It's to turn themselves into either pure facticity or pure transcendence. Or as Sartre says, we all secretly want to become God.
POD1000000022_S0000078	Let's talk about what he means by that. Think about the way followers of the Abrahamic religions have traditionally looked at God. What is it like to be God? Well, God is perfect. God is, in this moment, everything he will ever be. If God had a job interview and the person asked him, what's one thing you'd change about yourself?
POD1000000022_S0000079	God literally doesn't have an answer to that question. But then on the other hand, God is all powerful. With the snap of his fingers, he can do anything he wants to do. In other words, in this old-style traditional view of what God is, on one hand,
POD1000000022_S0000080	God is perfect as he is, pure facticity. But on the other hand, God is all-powerful and capable of bringing about any possibility he wants. In other words, pure transcendence. Sartre would say this is no coincidence.
POD1000000022_S0000081	And it's also no coincidence that as people navigate their lives, they have all sorts of tactics they use to turn themselves either into somebody that ignores their possibilities and are perfect as they are right now, or someone who ignores the very real unfortunate facts about themselves.
POD1000000022_S0000082	and they stay lost in these unattainable dreams their entire life. This is the context we needed to understand a concept we talked about well over a year ago on the one episode we did on Sartre. The primary tactic that people use in their lives to turn themselves into either pure facticity
POD1000000022_S0000083	or pure transcendence like God, is what Sartre calls bad faith. Let's take a look at the most famous example of bad faith that Sartre lays out. And because we already talked about it in the other episode, I'll keep it brief.
POD1000000022_S0000084	Sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a cafe in Paris, watching a waiter as he does his job. Now you can imagine a waiter in the 1940s, right? Dressed up in his little outfit, very upright, good posture, very proper.
POD1000000022_S0000085	He holds the tray in a particular way. He walks and changes direction in a very militaristic, particular way, like a good waiter does. Sartre can't help but point out that this guy doesn't seem to be a self with facticity and transcendence in this moment.
POD1000000022_S0000086	He seems to have relegated himself to just playing the part of a waiter. He's going through the motions trying to turn himself into pure facticity, just a waiter and nothing else. Now even though waiters don't act like this often in today's world,
POD1000000022_S0000087	Go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what Sarger is talking about here. I mean, there's so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of the same person. It seems to be a modern archetype of what it is to be a server. They all say the same stuff.
POD1000000022_S0000088	Hi, I'm John. I'm going to be taking care of you today. Can I get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks or something? But it's at every stage of the meal. How's everything tasting for you guys? Y'all save room for dessert? Now there's absolutely no rush. I'm going to leave the check here. I'm going to go over there.
POD1000000022_S0000090	Ask yourself, is this the way this guy talks to his mom? Is this the way he talks to his best friends? No. He's fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server. Now the point Sartre's making is not that waiters need to be more creative. It's not about waiters.
POD1000000022_S0000091	Sartre thinks that as human beings, we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap in all aspects of our life. We make proclamations about what we are all the time. I am a stay-at-home mom. That's my identity.
POD1000000022_S0000092	I am a libertarian. I am a Mormon. And that's that. What we're desperately trying to do with these proclamations is give ourselves an essence in a world where existence precedes essence.
POD1000000022_S0000093	All these things are just us wanting to think about ourselves as some static thing set in stone and run from the possibilities that we have. No, when we take an honest look at the possibilities at our disposal, it terrifies us and it produces a feeling called nausea.
POD1000000022_S0000094	and we use bad faith to quell this feeling of nausea. We're constantly doing this with ourselves. Now, if all you ever read was Sartre's Being and Nothingness, you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith
POD1000000022_S0000095	is an inescapable condition of being a human being. And that even when we're self-aware of the bad faith we're engaging in, we're still engaging in bad faith. If all you ever read was the main text of Being and Nothingness, you might get that impression, and it certainly sounds like a really sad picture,
POD1000000022_S0000096	But in one of the footnotes of being in nothingness, Sartre alludes to a way out of all of it. And perhaps to an ethics that he'd write later on in his life. Well, he never writes an ethics, and it may be because, you know, his lifelong partner.
POD1000000022_S0000097	and fellow existentialist Simone de Beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called the ethics of ambiguity. Next episode is part two on Simone de Beauvoir. So we're gonna be talking all about it. But enough of bad faith. Let's get back to answering this question. Who am I?
POD1000000022_S0000098	Really. Here's the thing. When it comes to these concepts of facticity and transcendence we've been talking about, when you just think generally about the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have, where are those things located? Where are you looking to find those?
POD1000000022_S0000099	Those things aren't hidden somewhere deep down within you that only you have access to. You may have a particular perspective of the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have. But not only do you have an incentive to slip into bad faith and tell yourself a story about them,
POD1000000022_S0000100	Sartre would say, you don't have some privileged VIP access to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have. I mean, hypothetically, any other person, if they were diligent enough, has access to your facticity and transcendence.
POD1000000022_S0000101	In fact, just like the guy that tells himself that he's Napoleon, sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than we are. But how is this possible? The reason it's possible is because the self is not the Christian soul, Desartre.
POD1000000022_S0000102	Just like your facticity and transcendence, what we're referencing when we talk about ourselves is outside of us. It's an abstraction. It's the conglomeration of all the things you've ever actually done in your life.
POD1000000022_S0000103	When you want to get a solid answer to the question, who am I? You don't reference the story that you tell yourself in your head that's clouded by all sorts of bad faith and wishful thinking like the guy that thinks he would try to take down the gunman at Walmart.
POD1000000022_S0000104	No, we tell ourselves stories all the time. What follows from this is that the true measure of your values, the true measure of who you are, is what you actually do. It's the collection of what you've actually done thus far in your life. And Sartre says that when you stop looking at the self
POD1000000022_S0000105	as though it's this thing inside of you. And you start looking at it more accurately as this abstraction that's outside of us. What you inevitably start to realize is that it's impossible to ever get a full picture of who you are without referencing the way that other people view you.
POD1000000022_S0000106	More than that, it's impossible to ever get a full picture of being without referencing other people. And here's what he's getting at. So far when it comes to describing being, we've been presented with being in itself and being for itself. But it's right here, fairly late in being itself,
POD1000000022_S0000107	nothingness, that Sartre lays out his third ontological category, what he calls being for others. Let's talk about what he means. Sartre would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you is existing alongside other people and all the consequences that come along with that.
POD1000000022_S0000108	This is Sartre's concept of being for others. Now how does being for others affect my answer to the question, who am I? Well again, this concept of the self is outside of us. It's an abstraction.
POD1000000022_S0000109	And what Sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people. For example, whether we're trustworthy or not. Whether or not you're a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that's mediated by other people, right?
POD1000000022_S0000110	Whether I'm a nice or mean person. Look, I may think of myself as a nice person, but if every single other person I encounter all throughout my life says that I'm mean, for all intents and purposes, I'm a mean person. This concept of the self
POD1000000022_S0000111	and how other people view us seem to be connected to Sartre. But the flip side of it being that interconnected is that it leaves us in what he describes as a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us.
POD1000000022_S0000112	We are almost always being turned into pure facticity in other people's minds.
POD1000000022_S0000113	Wow, what were they thinking when they picked out those shoes? This is obviously a person that doesn't care very much about the way that they look. In other words, they're looking at you and they're turning you into an object in their subjective view of the world. Pure facticity.
POD1000000022_S0000114	You will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person's mind. This is constantly going on. But Sarko's not saying it's always bad, that being around other people is some paranoid, everybody's thinking bad things about me all the time thing.
POD1000000022_S0000115	People very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time. The point that Sartre wants to make is that this whole dynamic, this dynamic of other people seeing you, putting you on trial, and turning you into pure facticity in their minds, this is going on all the time.
POD1000000022_S0000116	simply by virtue of the fact that we exist alongside other people. And that while the insights other people give us about who we are are no doubt valuable, we have to be careful not to slip into bad faith on either side of this dynamic of being for others. What I mean is,
POD1000000022_S0000117	Just because somebody sees you wearing weird shoes one day doesn't mean that you are now weird shoes guy in perpetuity. In other words, don't slip into bad faith when it comes to what other people think about you. No matter how convenient it may be to prescribe yourself an essence and deny your transcendence,
POD1000000022_S0000118	Don't turn yourself into pure facticity and just accept what other people tell you you are. Maybe you are a weird shoes guy right now, but you don't have to be in the future. But the other side of that is don't deny your facticity. Don't tell yourself your shoes are fine.
POD1000000022_S0000119	Don't tell yourself that you don't care what anyone else says or that what other people think doesn't matter to you at all. Obviously it does. That's slipping into another kind of bad faith.
POD1000000022_S0000120	So to sum this up, I guess, look, intuitively,
POD1000000022_S0000121	it may seem to us like we have a sort of special access to knowing who we are and that we choose to share ourselves with only our closest friends who we trust dearly. But Sartre would say that the reason it seems that way is because what you actually have is a narrative about yourself that
POD1000000022_S0000123	perspective and that the reason it seems like your friends reinforce this picture of who you are.
POD1000000022_S0000124	is because that's the very criteria we all use to choose who our friends are going to be. It's whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have of ourselves. That's what we like about our friends, Desartre.
POD1000000022_S0000125	For example, if a big part of the way that you view yourself and your identity is that you consider yourself to be a smart person, Sartre would predict that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you you're smart all the time.
POD1000000022_S0000126	or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer, making you feel smart, or other smart people that commend you on being smart like them. To Sartre, we choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves.
POD1000000022_S0000127	Of course we'd give them privileged access to our biased narrative of ourselves.
POD1000000022_S0000128	And of course it's going to feel validating. Of course it would seem that you know better than anyone else who you are. But again, Sartre would say that the true measure of your values, the true answer to the question, who are you?
POD1000000022_S0000129	is what you actually do. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.
POD1000000025_S0000000	There's sort of like a before we met and an after we met and no gradient.
POD1000000025_S0000001	Yeah.
POD1000000025_S0000002	They got all
POD1000000025_S0000003	Just like, I don't even know this guy, and then this is the person I work with on everything.
POD1000000025_S0000004	And I'm pretty sure this is the same time I was like, this is my best friend.
POD1000000025_S0000006	I'm David Diggs.
POD1000000025_S0000007	I'm Rafael Casal.
POD1000000025_S0000008	Everybody
POD1000000025_S0000010	It's a little hard to summarize the partnership between David and Raphael, because as best friends and creative collaborators, they've done so much over the years together.
POD1000000025_S0000011	Let me start individually. David Diggs won a Tony and a Grammy for his performance in Hamilton.
POD1000000025_S0000012	He played Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette in the original Broadway cast.
POD1000000025_S0000013	He's also the vocalist in the experimental hip-hop group, Clipping.
POD1000000025_S0000014	Rafael Casal is an actor, writer, and director. He's an award-winning slam poet and started appearing on HBO's Deaf Poetry Jam at the age of 18.
POD1000000025_S0000015	Over the 20 years these guys have known each other, they've worked in theater, poetry, music, and film. And usually in some combination of those mediums.
POD1000000025_S0000016	They co-wrote and co-starred in the film Blindspotting, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018.
POD1000000025_S0000017	And President Obama named it one of his favorite movies of the year.
POD1000000025_S0000018	Blindspotting takes place in Oakland, which is also where David and Rafael are from.
POD1000000025_S0000019	Their story begins at Berkeley High School. Here's David.
POD1000000025_S0000021	I'm not sure when we met or when we were formally introduced, but surely at some sort of poetry event, because we were both sort of coming up in that scene.
POD1000000025_S0000022	and I was older, I was four years older than him.
POD1000000025_S0000023	My freshman year, his senior year. That's a lifetime apart in high school.
POD1000000025_S0000024	My memory of him in high school is like, he's always had like a very nonchalant way about him.
POD1000000025_S0000025	And I don't know that this paints it accurately, but this is a representation of it. At some point, Dix was like, I'm just wearing pajama pants to school every day.
POD1000000025_S0000026	And I'm sure that wasn't the whole time. I got this little window of it.
POD1000000025_S0000027	It was the whole time. All of high school, for sure.
POD1000000025_S0000029	That's amazing!
POD1000000025_S0000030	It was like as a rule. But we would see each other at these poetry events and he was really, really good at writing poems.
POD1000000025_S0000031	like a way more sort of focused writer than I had ever been in that situation, you know?
POD1000000025_S0000032	So I remember that. I remember thinking that here's a person that's actually better than me at this thing.
POD1000000025_S0000033	And that's pretty cool.
POD1000000025_S0000034	Then over the years, also after when I was in college, when I'd come back home for the summers, sometimes I'd drop in just to watch like poetry things that were happening or sort of check in on the scene.
POD1000000025_S0000035	And he was like the dude, he had become that guy.
POD1000000025_S0000036	I remember that so differently.
POD1000000025_S0000038	I like barely finished high school in a very non-traditional way. And then went off and did this show on HBO, Deaf Poetry.
POD1000000025_S0000040	This just in, a skewed perspective for today's youth. Y'all ladies ain't thin enough, fellas ain't trim enough.
POD1000000025_S0000041	Wanna be sexy, y'all don't go to the gym enough. Cut to commercial.
POD1000000025_S0000042	Came back and had just enough money saved up with some friends to open a very dungeon-y recording studio. And we were looking for other artists. We didn't have anybody else recording at the studio.
POD1000000025_S0000043	And so a mutual friend of ours, one of his close friends, who was the older brother of one of my close friends, was like, you know, David raps.
POD1000000025_S0000044	Yeah, we really got set up on like a rapper play date.
POD1000000025_S0000045	So our friend Justin was like, you guys should work together. You're two of my favorite rappers.
POD1000000025_S0000046	I was like, yeah, yeah. And he played me stuff and it was really good.
POD1000000025_S0000047	I didn't have anywhere to record. I was recording songs in my mom's closet, in the little closet in my room.
POD1000000025_S0000048	I haven't been in a lot of studio spaces. So I was like, oh, studio.
POD1000000025_S0000049	I don't know that this qualified as an actual s-
POD1000000025_S0000050	I didn't know that yet.
POD1000000025_S0000051	because I haven't been there yet.
POD1000000025_S0000052	But I don't think we had any idea like what meeting each other and actually getting time was going to be like.
POD1000000025_S0000053	Finally, we started, it was like, this is the song we're gonna work with.
POD1000000025_S0000054	we had listened through some beats and it was like, let's work on this one.
POD1000000025_S0000055	I just started writing and yeah, it happened really fast.
POD1000000025_S0000056	And at some point we looked up and everyone else was gone and it was just the two of us in there. We were still making music.
POD1000000025_S0000058	We just made music until the sun came up and began the ritual that day of going to the car at 8am.
POD1000000025_S0000059	and playing everything that you'd recorded, and then like dragging your body home to sleep and kind of doing it all over again.
POD1000000025_S0000061	I've been making music for many, many years, and it had never been that much fun before.
POD1000000025_S0000062	Suddenly there's this person that like writes a verse in five minutes and can nail it in a take.
POD1000000025_S0000063	And at the time we were like working with some random singers and stuff that I couldn't ever sing the line and rappers who took like an hour to get a verse down.
POD1000000025_S0000064	It was just like, oh, this is so easy. And then we'll just have songs done.
POD1000000025_S0000065	And what we always joke about is like, there's sort of like a before we met and an after we met and no gradient.
POD1000000025_S0000066	Yeah.
POD1000000025_S0000068	I don't even know this guy and then this is the person I work with.
POD1000000025_S0000069	on everything.
POD1000000025_S0000070	And I'm pretty sure this is the same time I was like, this is my best friend.
POD1000000025_S0000072	Look!
POD1000000025_S0000074	as a young artist early on when I'm still trying to figure things out and creating is hard for me being around somebody who just creates all the time. It's addictive.
POD1000000025_S0000075	I don't have the technical skill set that Rafa has. He was so fast in Pro Tools.
POD1000000025_S0000076	So all of these things that I just, I would have to labor over. And then all of that stuff became really impressive too.
POD1000000025_S0000077	Once, you know, as we started working together and I became aware that he had taught himself all of these things, like nobody ever really showed him how to do anything, it seemed like.
POD1000000025_S0000078	And he was editing videos and shooting things, you know, the whole range of what it takes to be a music artist out in the world, he had taught himself to do.
POD1000000025_S0000079	I didn't really know anybody like that.
POD1000000025_S0000080	you know, over the next four or five years, we recorded
POD1000000025_S0000082	no one will ever hear.
POD1000000025_S0000084	Like legit hundreds.
POD1000000025_S0000085	and wrote a play together and then we lived together and it was like, oh man.
POD1000000025_S0000086	When we're around each other this much, it's like we have too many ideas.
POD1000000025_S0000087	It was like the the right amount of proximity for like the full version of creativity that we had always thought
POD1000000025_S0000088	Like we had thought we had already tapped it and we like did so much shit that year.
POD1000000025_S0000089	Yeah.
POD1000000025_S0000090	I think artistically we were doing great.
POD1000000025_S0000091	Yeah, we were definitely making it and we were definitely broke.
POD1000000025_S0000093	the thing. It was like...
POD1000000025_S0000094	You got on the radio.
POD1000000025_S0000095	This is also great, listen to how he says we at this point, that's really, Rafa was known, right?
POD1000000025_S0000096	He had a song that got played on Clear Channel Radio and then got named one of the Bay Area Freshman 10.
POD1000000025_S0000097	Best new whatever
POD1000000025_S0000098	He got named one of those, but Rafa never would take that for himself. And it was always like us.
POD1000000025_S0000099	we are and so like we played those shows together and like would end up making no money on these gigs.
POD1000000025_S0000100	because he would bring me and a band, like four or five other people to play music, use the entire fee to fly us out to wherever, Georgia, and like play a show where no one would make any money, but we got to play a show.
POD1000000025_S0000101	And he was like doing that from jump for so long.
POD1000000025_S0000102	Why was that how you would always do it?
POD1000000025_S0000103	Well, cuz that one I don't I'm uncomfortable with I statements
POD1000000025_S0000105	Berkeley is shit.
POD1000000025_S0000108	Oh my God, Rowan.
POD1000000025_S0000110	They feel self-indulgent.
POD1000000025_S0000112	I was raised to not feed an ego that feels constantly eager for food.
POD1000000025_S0000114	What I love about that period is like we were all pushing to little different degrees of success.
POD1000000025_S0000115	We're just kind of weirdos, like almost in a scene that we kind of make sense in.
POD1000000025_S0000116	They didn't understand digs very much at all. I feel like the more commercial Bay Area scene
POD1000000025_S0000117	And they only sort of understood me. Like it was very like, yeah, you're in, but like, don't try to make any changes.
POD1000000025_S0000118	And I think that's a big reason that we went to LA.
POD1000000025_S0000119	We can see the top of the ladder and it's not getting any friendlier or more receptive.
POD1000000025_S0000120	And we maybe could make this movie and maybe there's like different music opportunities down there, but it's definitely not going to happen here.
POD1000000025_S0000121	And then suddenly we packed up from the West Oakland place and moved to LA.
POD1000000025_S0000122	Also, we had already been, we were working on blind spotting and so we'd been traveling up and down.
POD1000000025_S0000123	our producers, we had been driving to meet with them really frequently.
POD1000000025_S0000124	We were slumming it so hard when we got to LA. We were so poor. Diggs was delivering tacos.
POD1000000025_S0000125	Yeah, I was like, I couldn't be an actor in LA is what I decided.
POD1000000025_S0000126	We're just like swinging and missing.
POD1000000025_S0000128	Just trying to figure out what does it mean to be in the bigger pond and want to be an artist professionally.
POD1000000025_S0000129	And we did five years in LA before Diggs went to New York to do Hamilton.
POD1000000025_S0000130	I think that was one of those things that came about for Diggs really organically.
POD1000000025_S0000131	Hamilton was such an interesting play. It was legit written for him to flex all the things he's good at.
POD1000000025_S0000132	they were like who's this like rap kid that like turns out can also act
POD1000000025_S0000133	And the rest of us were like, turns out he's been doing that more than a lot of y'all, you know.
POD1000000025_S0000134	And then the world saw digs in the light that best showed everything. And they not only accepted, but obsessed over it.
POD1000000025_S0000135	And then I went to visit him in New York when the show was picking up steam.
POD1000000025_S0000136	And the first thing that happened is this girl grabs my arm and looks at Diggs and goes, oh my God, is that Davi Diggs to me?
POD1000000025_S0000137	And I like start to realize that this woman is Anne Hathaway. And she's like fangirling out.
POD1000000025_S0000138	And I'm like, oh man, like a major shift is happening.
POD1000000025_S0000139	My life is changing very, very quickly. I was under stress constantly.
POD1000000025_S0000140	Rafa is like calling and texting and emailing and I'm like getting back to the degree that I can.
POD1000000025_S0000141	And so, like, yes, obviously it would have been, like, so much easier and nicer if my best friend was also living in New York and somebody who has context for me outside of this thing.
POD1000000025_S0000142	And I remember I got somebody turn days and I was like, I'm thinking about moving to New York. So you'll respond more in person.
POD1000000025_S0000143	And I remember Diggs goes, I didn't want to ask.
POD1000000025_S0000145	That's like a big ask. And like, I'm doing eight shows a week. It's not like move to New York and like, let's go kick it in the Berkshires.
POD1000000025_S0000146	You know, like, it's like, move to New York and I'll see you like at midnight sometimes.
POD1000000025_S0000147	But I was like, well, it's just good for him to have a friend there, but also like, can I run your social media?
POD1000000025_S0000149	because you're not posting enough and people want to see this adventure and there's a sincere way to do it.
POD1000000025_S0000150	And I had done like a little bit of it with his Twitter and stuff in the Bay and in LA, but like, this was like, give me your passwords. I probably already had them.
POD1000000025_S0000152	It was an admission that he was going to
POD1000000025_S0000154	And I was like, yeah, yeah, I'd do that.
POD1000000025_S0000155	And especially if you actually don't even have to do it.
POD1000000025_S0000157	Be self-indulgent. I'm doing it.
POD1000000025_S0000159	You know, like, like, there's like a year of his Instagram that's just his friend's version of how awesome he is.
POD1000000025_S0000161	You know.
POD1000000025_S0000162	Blindspotting got started because around when I was 21, one of my friends got killed in a way that sort of didn't make a lot of sense to most people in the community.
POD1000000025_S0000163	And it was sort of like the breaking point because it was a woman, because it was somebody who wasn't really involved in the violence of the world that we were existing in at the time.
POD1000000025_S0000164	Some other people have been killed, other people I was close to. There's a series of funerals people have gone to in succession.
POD1000000025_S0000165	And this was the button on it. It was just like a breaking point for me.
POD1000000025_S0000166	And so I'd written this poem about sort of like the numbness of that experience of like, God, is this like what life is?
POD1000000025_S0000167	Like people die and we get numb and we care a little less every time. Like, how does this go?
POD1000000025_S0000168	And then we just kind of started coming up with a story that was a movie that's in verse starring the two of us.
POD1000000025_S0000169	We kept almost making blind spotting and not making it.
POD1000000025_S0000170	Diggs, he finishes this massive sensation in New York. He had like 30 days in June that he could shoot this movie.
POD1000000025_S0000171	22.
POD1000000025_S0000172	And then a month later we were in Oakland shooting the movie.
POD1000000025_S0000173	In the hometown, like, everybody who's an extra in that movie is a friend of ours that we grew up with.
POD1000000025_S0000174	And it's still not a real movie to us. It's still a thing we can't believe they made.
POD1000000025_S0000175	in Hollywood, in a world that we always assumed we didn't belong in, you know, that we never really figured out how we would fit into anyway.
POD1000000025_S0000176	To have doors start opening in a way where they're sort of asking questions about what you want to do is crazy, actually.
POD1000000025_S0000177	It's just fun in meetings post blind spotting now that we're associated together in this way and also people have been able to see that Raphael is a great actor as well as a great writer.
POD1000000025_S0000178	like, where it's like, well, what's he doing? Do you think he'd be interested in this?
POD1000000025_S0000179	can you talk to him for us? It's like pretty, I love that. I love that so much.
POD1000000025_S0000180	And I still know the 10 things that he can do that nobody's seen yet. And that's still fun for me.
POD1000000025_S0000181	The closest I have ever gotten to fighting with Rafa, I think, is like when somebody else I'm close to is fighting with Rafa. Right?
POD1000000025_S0000182	I think that's sort of our good cop bad cop side.
POD1000000025_S0000183	Plus I'm gonna be like venting to him and he's like, I don't know what to tell you. I've already picked my team.
POD1000000025_S0000185	We have this expression that we always say, we do this before every show and we kind of do it anytime we're at a Crossroads, we're like.
POD1000000025_S0000187	It's just like this whole ship runs on enthusiasm.
POD1000000025_S0000189	David Diggs and Rafael Casal are partners.
POD1000000025_S0000190	Go watch their film Blindspotting and check out the album they put out together last year called Seven Nights in Chicago.
POD1000000025_S0000191	You can follow them on Twitter or Instagram, at DavidDiggs and at Rafael Casal. Rafael probably still has the passwords to David's accounts.

POD1000000027_S0000009	From ESPN, you're listening to 30 for 30 podcasts. My name is Jody Avergand. Welcome to our fifth season of original audio documentaries. As we've done before, we're devoting the entire season to one story. It's told over five parts.
POD1000000027_S0000011	It's about a scandal that rocked the NBA and tells us a lot about how power, race, and celebrity intersect in modern sports.
POD1000000027_S0000013	For this season, we're excited to work with ESPN's Ramona Shelburne, one of our top NBA reporters, an LA native and someone who's been covering this story from the moment it broke.
POD1000000027_S0000014	Ramona is your host for all five episodes. A quick word of warning, this season contains mature subject matter and language. And now, coming up after the break, from 30 for 30 and the undefeated, The Sterling Affairs.
POD1000000027_S0000016	Shelly Sterling thought she was just going to return some clothes to Neiman Marcus when she got in her Mercedes-Benz station wagon and made the drive from Malibu to Beverly Hills. It was early in the spring of 2014.
POD1000000027_S0000017	And even though Shelly was almost 80 years old, she was still going into town, as rich people called Beverly Hills, four or five days a week. It's hard to guess Shelly's age if you don't know it.
POD1000000027_S0000018	because she keeps her hair this convincing pale blonde, and her face is very well maintained. Driving into Beverly Hills is basically like entering a state park for the rich and famous.
POD1000000027_S0000019	There are the iconic brown and yellow signs that let you know you have entered a special place. And Shelly Sterling and her husband Donald own a ton of it.
POD1000000027_S0000020	Over their 60-year marriage, the Sterlings built a real estate empire. In their heyday, they were the largest residential landlords in L.A. County.
POD1000000027_S0000022	But most people knew her husband Donald Sterling as the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, one of the worst owners in all of sports. His team was the laughingstock of the NBA for decades.
POD1000000027_S0000023	For Shelly, it should have been, would have been, just a jaunt down Rodeo Drive to return some wildly expensive clothes. But unbeknownst to her, her husband was also at Neiman Marcus that day.
POD1000000027_S0000024	with a woman 49 years his junior named Vy Steviano. She wasn't the first mistress, not even close. But Vy was something different.
POD1000000027_S0000026	Shelly told me that story when we met in the winter of 2019 at the Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel, or my hotel, as she calls it.
POD1000000027_S0000027	Shelley was 84 at the time, but she can tell that story of that run-in with Donald and Vee five years earlier with exacting detail.
POD1000000027_S0000028	I happened to be there to return something and she was there with Donald and with some other friends. And we had a big confrontation. She was very, very, very nasty and mean to me.
POD1000000027_S0000029	What happened was that she ran into Shelly, I think at Northstone. And they started talking, and I guess things got out of hand.
POD1000000027_S0000030	That's V. Stiviano's lawyer, Mac Nehore. And when I told Shelly Sterling his version of the story, she scoffed.
POD1000000027_S0000031	It was at Neiman Marcus.
POD1000000027_S0000032	At first I thought it was funny that Shelley took the time to correct him. I mean, here's a woman talking to a FEMA reporter about her husband's infidelity. Who cares whether you confront your husband's mistress outside of Neiman Marcus or Nordy's?
POD1000000027_S0000033	But the details matter here. It's important to get it right. Because that meeting outside of Neiman Marcus, that petty squabble between a wife and her husband's mistress, set off a chain of events.
POD1000000027_S0000034	that in the end led to one of the biggest scandals in professional sports. A controversy that forced the NBA to finally deal with Donald Sterling after decades of his bad behavior and had ripple effects throughout the entire league.
POD1000000027_S0000036	This is The Sterling Affairs, from 30 for 30 Podcasts and The Undefeated. I'm Ramona Shelburne.
POD1000000027_S0000039	I've covered basketball in LA for a long time. The NBA is a league of huge personalities and even bigger egos fighting for power. And if you want the real score, that's the game you have to follow.
POD1000000027_S0000041	I learned pretty quickly that there's no other owner in basketball with quite the same personality or ego as Donald Sterling. Sterling wasn't a basketball guy. He was a personal injury lawyer. And then he got filthy rich off of real estate.
POD1000000027_S0000043	That's what he was really good at.
POD1000000027_S0000045	I could never understand why he even kept the Clippers when his reputation as an owner was so bad. But that's because I always assumed that deep down he wanted what everyone in the game is supposed to want. To win.
POD1000000027_S0000047	But rich people, like Donald Sterling, multi-billion dollar rich people, don't live in the same world as the rest of us. Don't play by the same rules. When you have enough money, it's like you're rubber. Everything just bounces off of you.
POD1000000027_S0000048	Even three decades of driving an NBA franchise into the ground. When you're as rich as Donald and Shelley, you get to tell yourself that everything is fabulous.
POD1000000027_S0000049	I feel fabulous.
POD1000000027_S0000050	They're fabulous!
POD1000000027_S0000051	Fabulous!
POD1000000027_S0000052	He was just so fabulous.
POD1000000027_S0000053	I was born and raised in LA and I've never heard anyone use the word fabulous as much as these two do.
POD1000000027_S0000054	They were fabulous. It was just fabulous.
POD1000000027_S0000055	Even their court battles.
POD1000000027_S0000056	I want to thank everybody who has helped me, my attorneys, they were fabulous.
POD1000000027_S0000057	and of course, anything related to the team.
POD1000000027_S0000058	And the US team that won it all, the fabulous American team. We are fabulous. Let's give a hand to America. USA!
POD1000000027_S0000060	And Donald Sterling's life was fabulous. Why would he think otherwise? Nobody ever questioned him to his face anyway. He did whatever he wanted. He said whatever he wanted. He had relationships with whomever he wanted.
POD1000000027_S0000062	I didn't know Vistaviano back then. And yes, that is her real name. V, just the letter V with a period. She was born Maria Vanessa Perez.
POD1000000027_S0000063	but changed her name to V. Stiviano at about the same time she'd met Donald at a Super Bowl party in 2010. Before that, she'd been trying desperately to climb out of the poverty that she'd grown up in.
POD1000000027_S0000064	She'd been running a food truck business and trying to work her way onto reality TV shows, and cozying up to whomever was the most relevant, powerful, or famous. Then she met Donald.
POD1000000027_S0000066	There's an unwritten contract between young women and their very rich but much older sugar daddies that helps each side pretend it's about love and not sex for money. Never talk about age. Pretend looks don't matter.
POD1000000027_S0000067	Money in her maize bags are gifts. And never, ever humiliate the wife. But Vistaviano either didn't know or didn't care, because she broke every last rule in the mistress' terms and agreements.
POD1000000027_S0000068	she went right at Shelly.
POD1000000027_S0000069	She said to the people in the office, I'm going to own the office one day. And she said to the Clipper people, she says, this is going to be my team one day. I mean, just bold, really bold.
POD1000000027_S0000070	And it all got back to me, you know.
POD1000000027_S0000071	She kept telling people she was going to be the next Mrs. Sterling.
POD1000000027_S0000072	Katherine Bauman is one of Shelley's best friends and a longtime Clippers fan.
POD1000000027_S0000073	She would stalk Shelly, she would watch where Shelly would go, and then she'd show up. And I do remember at the one time she went into the restroom where Shelly was, just paraded around, showed off herself, then Shelly walked out.
POD1000000027_S0000074	At Clippers games, the entire extended Sterling universe was usually there and usually just feet from one another. Sometimes Shelly and Donald sat in their court side seats together, and Vy sat in her seats directly across the court.
POD1000000027_S0000075	Other nights, V would sit next to Donald and Shelly was nowhere to be seen. Clipper players like Ryan Hollins and Matt Barnes got used to V being around. You couldn't not notice her.
POD1000000027_S0000076	She would just parade around the arena and it's like, it was so awkward, like, we kind of know what's going on, but you're doing it in front of our faces as if we're silly. And so it was an odd, odd situation.
POD1000000027_S0000077	Nobody liked her. We knew why she was here and we all thought it was crazy to begin with, but you know, it wasn't our place to speak on it at the time.
POD1000000027_S0000078	Clippers employees often got caught in the middle of this bizarre triangle. Shelly would call team president Andy Roser, demanding that V not be allowed in the building. And then Donald would call Roser and ask him to leave four tickets for her.
POD1000000027_S0000079	These were relationships begging to implode. But none of the entangled ever tried to solve the problem. Donald, Shelly, Vee, each kept pushing each other, waiting for someone to break.
POD1000000027_S0000080	Well, the breaking started on Christmas Day 2012. V called the Sterling house asking to speak to Donald.
POD1000000027_S0000081	We were all sitting down Christmas Day, having dinner, and she called.
POD1000000027_S0000082	Shelly was mortified. The family was sitting at the dinner table waiting for Donald as he's pacing on the tennis courts outside fighting with his mistress.
POD1000000027_S0000083	I don't know, they had some argument and the family heard about it, you know. It just, it wasn't a good scene.
POD1000000027_S0000085	The fight with Shelly started when he hung up.
POD1000000027_S0000086	Not that that was uncommon, even without V, they fought often. But this was escalating. Shelly and Donald's youngest son, Scott, had to step in before it got physical. He confronted his father and demanded he stop this nonsense with V.
POD1000000027_S0000087	and stop disrespecting his mother like this.
POD1000000027_S0000089	It was a big moment, but nothing came of it.
POD1000000027_S0000091	A week later, Scott died.
POD1000000027_S0000093	It was first reported to be a pulmonary embolism, but later revealed to be an overdose. He was 32.
POD1000000027_S0000095	And I don't think people realize this, but you lost a child.
POD1000000027_S0000096	I know.
POD1000000027_S0000097	Right around then.
POD1000000027_S0000098	January 1st.
POD1000000027_S0000100	Shelley was devastated.
POD1000000027_S0000101	I was going through the motions of living.
POD1000000027_S0000103	It wasn't just that the fight with V was a last volatile moment between Donald and Scott.
POD1000000027_S0000105	When Scott died, Donald stayed with Fee instead of going home to his wife as she grieved. It was too much. She kicked Don out of the house.
POD1000000027_S0000107	Shelly needed breathing room and I think Don had pushed the envelope a little too far.
POD1000000027_S0000108	I really thought that we probably were going to be getting a divorce.
POD1000000027_S0000110	But Shelly and Donald had been together too long, been through too much together, had too much of their lives and their money intertwined.
POD1000000027_S0000112	They did not divorce. The situation simply continued to deteriorate over the next year as Donald spent more and more time with V.
POD1000000027_S0000114	Plus, Shelly was starting to learn about the gifts. V posted pictures on Instagram, V driving the $240,000 red Ferrari that Donald had bought her.
POD1000000027_S0000115	and the Range Rover, and the two Bentleys. Shelley also found out that Donald had bought V a $1.8 million duplex.
POD1000000027_S0000116	When I found out that he had paid for all the cars and he paid for this house, I was furious.
POD1000000027_S0000117	It was that anger that Shelly brought to Neiman Marcus with her returns on the fateful day that she encountered Donald and Vy. It wasn't the first time the two women had run into each other or argued, but this time Shelly decided she'd had enough.
POD1000000027_S0000118	And that's when I decided I was going to sue her.
POD1000000027_S0000119	On March 7, 2014, Shelly Sterling filed a lawsuit in California's Superior Court against V. Stiviano, seeking the return of all those gifts from Donald.
POD1000000027_S0000121	Donald and Shelley Sterling were worth multiple billions of dollars and had done what the ultra-rich do, put all their money and property into a joint trust.
POD1000000027_S0000122	Every dime that the Sterling spent cost each of them a nickel. Therefore, Shelley argued, the money that Donald used to pay for the gifts was just as much hers as it was his.
POD1000000027_S0000123	So she turned to the courts. That sounds a little extreme? Well, you don't know the Sterlings. Calling a lawyer is how they get out of bed in the morning.
POD1000000027_S0000124	To say they're litigious is like saying there's traffic on the 405. And besides, suing to get what they want had proven incredibly effective for the Sterlings over the years.
POD1000000027_S0000125	Most people didn't have the means or the stomach to battle them in court. They'd settle before they starved.
POD1000000027_S0000126	She kept saying to Donald, you better have her drop the lawsuit. And he'd say, oh, she won't really go through with it, but she's just doing it for effect. And she says, well, she better drop the lawsuit.
POD1000000027_S0000127	But here's how the lawsuit, the courtroom product of a bedroom dispute, really came to change everything. For some time now, V had been recording her conversations with Donald.
POD1000000027_S0000128	Sweetie, I'm sorry.
POD1000000027_S0000129	I'm so sorry, Jim. We made a giant mistake. Both of us.
POD1000000027_S0000130	And according to V and her lawyer, Donald was aware she was making the tapes.
POD1000000027_S0000132	He'd been forgetting things he said to her, and the tapes were a way of reminding him.
POD1000000027_S0000134	Please leave me alone. Please, please.
POD1000000027_S0000135	She'd recorded hundreds of conversations over the past two years. A lot of the recordings were mundane, boring even. But some of the recordings were arguments, and Capture decided Donald that he would never want his wife or anyone else to hear.
POD1000000027_S0000136	I guess that you don't know that. Maybe you're stupid.
POD1000000027_S0000137	No matter what the original intent of those tapes was, they became something V could use as blackmail. Because V Stiviano had no intention of returning those gifts from Donald.
POD1000000027_S0000138	She wanted me to drop the lawsuit.
POD1000000027_S0000139	V says to Donald, I want that bitch wife of yours lawsuit dismissed.
POD1000000027_S0000140	Pierce O'Donnell is Shelly Sterling's lawyer.
POD1000000027_S0000141	And he tried to get Shelly dismissed and she wouldn't do it.
POD1000000027_S0000142	If Donald couldn't, or wouldn't, fix the situation, Bea decided she would take matters into her own hands. It was time to use the tapes.
POD1000000027_S0000143	to reveal Donald Sterling for who he really was.

POD1000000027_S0000161	On April 9, 2014, Eclipra's executive assistant texted V on behalf of Donald.
POD1000000027_S0000162	The text was to make sure that Bea understood she wasn't welcome at the game against the Oklahoma City Thunder later that evening, that her tickets, her VIP pass, and her parking had been revoked.
POD1000000027_S0000163	V responded with a series of escalating texts, saying she was going to the game anyway, and then some veiled threats.
POD1000000027_S0000164	I would hate for Staples Center to get involved in what's going on.
POD1000000027_S0000165	Three hours later, she got a response.
POD1000000027_S0000166	Mr. Sterling said to let me know if you need anything. You don't want to have any issues at the gate.
POD1000000027_S0000167	V header opening.
POD1000000027_S0000168	No, you tell Mr. Sterling that I don't need anything, nor do I want anything. But thanks for asking. Let the games begin.
POD1000000027_S0000170	Attached to the text was an audio file. And when the Clippers employee opened the file, she heard this.
POD1000000027_S0000171	In your lousy Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with walking with black people.
POD1000000027_S0000172	And it bothers you.
POD1000000027_S0000173	That bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. You'll have to.
POD1000000027_S0000174	you'll still see it with black people.
POD1000000027_S0000175	I'm not you and you're not me. You're supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate Latina girl.
POD1000000027_S0000176	I'm a mixed girl.
POD1000000027_S0000178	It was shocking. The Clippers assistant immediately emailed the file to Clippers president Andy Roser. And that's how Shelly learned about the tape, too.
POD1000000027_S0000179	I didn't even know that the tape was sent to the Clippers until somebody at a game told me that they said they received a tape from her.
POD1000000027_S0000180	And I said, well, what is the tape about? So I said to Andy, Andy Roser, I said, Andy, what are you doing about this? And he says, oh, well, she'll never do anything.
POD1000000027_S0000181	Roser had worked for Donald Sterling for nearly three decades. He did what everybody learns to do after a while. Stay out of the really ugly stuff.
POD1000000027_S0000182	Donald and Shelley had cleaned up their own messes for six decades. He figured they'd eventually make this one go away, too. But they didn't. Shelley told her lawyers about the tapes.
POD1000000027_S0000183	And they in turn went to V's lawyer and demanded to hear them. And that's when V Stiviano made her big move.
POD1000000027_S0000185	I got a call by a trusted confidential source who said, you have to hear this.
POD1000000027_S0000186	Mike Walters was the news director at TMZ at the time. Now he runs his own celebrity news site, The Blast.
POD1000000027_S0000187	The first thing I did was say, who's Donald Sterling? I had heard the name. I knew that Donald Sterling was important, but I had no idea that he owned the Clippers.
POD1000000027_S0000188	Even for someone from TMZ, whose job was breaking the internet with the juiciest, most controversial stories, this felt like something different.
POD1000000027_S0000190	I received the audio and said, oh my God.
POD1000000027_S0000193	It was the most repulsive, disgusting,
POD1000000027_S0000195	Unbelievable.
POD1000000027_S0000197	audio or moment that I'd ever heard in my lifetime come out of somebody's mouth that then once I realized who they were, how much impact that may have.
POD1000000027_S0000199	But no one in the Clippers world seemed to realize.
POD1000000027_S0000201	The fact is, Shelley and several people in the Clippers organization heard the recording and decided not to act on it, or weren't appalled enough to act on it. Maybe they didn't understand how big a splash this tape could make.
POD1000000027_S0000203	I think this deals with very touchy subjects like racism, sexism,
POD1000000027_S0000205	things that touch everyone in this country. So I knew with all of that combined with the fact that it actually was on tape.
POD1000000027_S0000207	And if I could do my job properly, everyone was going to hear it, that this would be a gigantic thing.
POD1000000027_S0000209	So Mike Walters called up the NBA. Their new commissioner, Adam Silver, had barely been in office for three months.
POD1000000027_S0000210	I actually had never heard of Adam Silver until that day.
POD1000000027_S0000212	Turns out not even TMZ was going to release something like this without some due diligence.
POD1000000027_S0000214	There is a balance between privacy of people and the public's interest in what is said in this audio. And I think everyone will agree with me when I say this,
POD1000000027_S0000215	This had to be heard, period.
POD1000000027_S0000217	After calling the league, TMZ called the Clippers to let them know they were about to publish a tape that would be very damaging to Donald Sterling.
POD1000000027_S0000218	If you're Donald Sterling, there's never a good time to have your girlfriend out you as a racist. If you're the Clippers, this could not have happened at a worse moment. Donald Sterling's Clippers have been a laughingstock for decades.
POD1000000027_S0000220	I mean because honestly like these Clippers jokes or something we they're not even jokes their statements of fact
POD1000000027_S0000222	In the 30-some-odd years he'd owned the team, they'd only made the playoffs six times. They'd never even moved past the semifinals. That had all started to change in the late 2000s, though. The team had drafted a star, Blake Griffin.
POD1000000027_S0000223	NBA Rookie of the Year, Blake Griffin!
POD1000000027_S0000225	and then ended up with another star, Chris Paul.
POD1000000027_S0000226	Los Angeles is electric with the addition of Chris Paul to the clippers.
POD1000000027_S0000227	Had you heard of the Clippers before this?
POD1000000027_S0000228	after a trade saga that rocked the NBA and somehow ended up in favor of the perennial loser Clippers over the NBA's golden child, the Los Angeles Lakers.
POD1000000027_S0000230	The buzz in Los Angeles has instantly shifted to the Clippers.
POD1000000027_S0000231	In time for this season, the Clippers had also managed to get themselves one of the best coaches in the NBA, Doc Rivers.
POD1000000027_S0000232	It's Doc Rivers to the Clippers, three years, $21 million.
POD1000000027_S0000233	There was a hope of stability, balance, even winning.
POD1000000027_S0000235	2012 saw one playoff run. 2013 saw another. And 2014 was going to be the year where they might finally contend for a championship.
POD1000000027_S0000236	I'm excited to bring a championship here to LA in a Clippers uniform.
POD1000000027_S0000237	But now the Cooper curse was about to rear its head again.
POD1000000027_S0000238	The one thing I can always rely on is that the Clippers screw things up.
POD1000000027_S0000240	Once the Clippers staff found out TMZ was going to publish the tape, Andy Roser went to coach Doc Rivers. He needed him to talk to the team before the story broke.
POD1000000027_S0000241	Andy, I remember coming in my office one day and said, hey, there's a tape that TMZ has that's going to come out. It's not that flattering, but it's not a big deal. Honestly, I thought it was a sex tape because of Donald Sterling. I really did.
POD1000000027_S0000242	So Doc did as he was told, and gathered the players and warned them that something was coming. Superstar Clippers forward Blake Griffin and center Ryan Hollins were in that room.
POD1000000027_S0000243	Doc, gather this.
POD1000000027_S0000244	Doc said, hey guys, we need to meet and talk.
POD1000000027_S0000245	and this is about to come out.
POD1000000027_S0000246	We don't know what the heck this is gonna turn into
POD1000000027_S0000247	People are gonna run with this. None of us realized the extent, because we didn't hear the recording or whatever it was.
POD1000000027_S0000248	He tells us to kind of prepare yourself because we're playing Golden State and the focus at hand is win the game.
POD1000000027_S0000249	So I think we were all kind of like, all right, well, this is another thing. We'll get ready for this game.
POD1000000027_S0000251	Welcome back to SportsCenter where we have some breaking news. A disturbing story including the owner of one of the NBA's playoff teams.
POD1000000027_S0000252	TMZ dropped this story at 10 p.m. Pacific time on a Friday night, April 25, 2014.
POD1000000027_S0000253	There's an audio recording purportedly of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the National Basketball Association.
POD1000000027_S0000254	Why should you be walking properly with black people?
POD1000000027_S0000255	Does it matter if they're white or blue or yellow?
POD1000000027_S0000256	I guess that you don't know that, maybe you're stupid.
POD1000000027_S0000258	I was covering the NBA playoffs for ESPN when this scandal broke. Like literally I was courtside at a game in Portland and I get this frantic phone call from our news desk.
POD1000000027_S0000259	telling me I had to listen to this tape.
POD1000000027_S0000261	People call you and tell you that I have black people on my Instagram and it bothers you.
POD1000000027_S0000262	That bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?
POD1000000027_S0000264	Suddenly, the playoff game between the Trail Blazers and the Houston Rockets taking place in front of me seemed completely insignificant.
POD1000000027_S0000266	I filed my game story and tried to start wrapping my head around this one.
POD1000000027_S0000268	Like TMZ's Mike Walters, as soon as I heard that tape, I knew this was going to be huge.
POD1000000027_S0000269	The disgraced Clippers owner in the spotlight.
POD1000000027_S0000270	Sterling has a long history of questionable behavior.
POD1000000027_S0000272	It's obviously appalling, it's very disturbing, but to be quite honest with you, I wasn't too surprised.
POD1000000027_S0000273	Within hours, the audio of Donald Sterling making racist remarks to Vy Stiviano had gone viral.
POD1000000027_S0000275	TMZ's cameramen and reporters swarmed the lobby of the Clippers team hotel. They had booked several rooms at the Four Seasons in advance, so they could legally be inside the private property.
POD1000000027_S0000276	Outside the hotel was even more chaotic. The whole world wanted a reaction. Clippers Team Security advised players and staffers to stay inside their hotel rooms as much as possible. They were on lockdown.
POD1000000027_S0000277	When it came out I remember it just being chaos. Just from then on it was just that's all anybody was talking about.
POD1000000027_S0000278	By morning, LeBron James, the biggest star in the league, was saying, there's no room for a person like Donald Sterling in the NBA.
POD1000000027_S0000280	And across the country, Adam Silver was facing his first real crisis.
POD1000000027_S0000281	NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sitting down in Memphis addressing the comments made by Donald Sterling.
POD1000000027_S0000282	The audio recording posted by TMZ is truly offensive and disturbing, and we intend to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible.
POD1000000027_S0000283	Silver launched an investigation within hours.
POD1000000027_S0000284	I am not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against Donald Sterling. We will, however, move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation.
POD1000000027_S0000286	If it was Sterling on those tapes, if they hadn't been doctored or altered, Silver knew he wanted to punish him severely. The league was outraged.
POD1000000027_S0000287	Because on top of Donald Sterling saying all those unforgivably racist things, Sterling was also taking shots at one of the most beloved figures in all of basketball, Magic Johnson.
POD1000000027_S0000289	It was as shocking and as bizarre as anything on the tape that a picture of V Stiviano and Magic Johnson had set him off. To hear Donald Sterling talk that way about magic?
POD1000000027_S0000290	The guy who turned the Lakers into a dynasty, who fought off HIV? That's the guy Donald Sterling told his mistress wasn't welcome at his games?
POD1000000027_S0000291	Plain and simple, when you heard those comments, Magic, what was your reaction?
POD1000000027_S0000292	I was really upset. You know, you can't understand how hurt I was. He shouldn't own a team anymore, especially when you have African Americans renting his apartments, coming to the games.
POD1000000027_S0000293	and playing for him and coaching for him. This is bad for everybody. It's bad for America. And so I'm really upset about it.
POD1000000027_S0000294	Even the famously apolitical Michael Jordan voiced his outrage.
POD1000000027_S0000295	Michael Jordan weighed in there is no room in the NBA or anywhere else for the kind of racism and hatred that mr Sterling allegedly expressed we cannot tolerate must not tolerate discrimination at any level
POD1000000027_S0000296	But the story was bigger than the NBA. It revealed something raw and ugly. It triggered millions of people.
POD1000000027_S0000298	It's like what one of the paparazzi who was tailing Donald and Shelley told me. It had all the elements. Sex, money, sports, politics, greed, racism.
POD1000000027_S0000299	It had everything. It even had the visor. You remember the visor. That Daft Punk welding mask meets Florida grandma visor that V Stiviano wore any time she stepped outside of her house.
POD1000000027_S0000300	But still saying nothing is Vy Stiviano. Not late this afternoon when she arrived home or when she left tonight, wearing different clothes, but color-coordinated face shields.
POD1000000027_S0000301	The woman who set this whole thing off was out there rollerblading for the paparazzi.
POD1000000027_S0000302	Have you talked to Mr. Sterling? Can you explain the mask?
POD1000000027_S0000303	This was a full-on media circus.
POD1000000027_S0000304	Why are you wearing the shield? Why are you holding a microphone?
POD1000000027_S0000305	I don't know, it's my job. Well, then, it's my job.
POD1000000027_S0000306	By the end of the weekend, the first black president of the United States was answering questions about Sterling.
POD1000000027_S0000308	I suspect that the NBA is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this. You know, we, the United States, continues to wrestle with a legacy of race.
POD1000000027_S0000309	The tapes dominated the news cycle, not just because they were juicy, but because Donald Sterling was articulating something deeper, more shameful.
POD1000000027_S0000311	a plantation mentality that's at the heart of a lot of this country's history.
POD1000000027_S0000313	That's an NBA owner, a man worth billions of dollars, going on for more than nine minutes spewing the most vile of racist thoughts. A white owner whose 20-man roster was stacked with a majority of African-American players.
POD1000000027_S0000314	including Ryan Holland.
POD1000000027_S0000315	Those words hurt when you hear I don't want people like that Well the people like that Play for you the people like that buy your tickets the people like that Bleed just like you, bro
POD1000000027_S0000317	Earthquakes, both real and metaphorical, happen suddenly, but they are anything but sudden. The tremor is a product of tensions that build up for years, until the fault lines simply break.
POD1000000027_S0000318	Los Angeles sits on two fault lines, San Andreas and race. All of us know it. We live with it. Donald Sterling was another.
POD1000000027_S0000319	Anyone who played for him or worked for him or covered him in the press or lived in one of his hundreds of apartments on the one hand knew that it was all a matter of time until he blew up. The underlying issues with Sterling were well known and well documented.
POD1000000027_S0000320	But like most insanely wealthy white men in America, Donald had managed to wiggle, bully, and fight his way out of all of them. He knew how to play his leverage and power to outlast his adversaries and win. You can call it that.
POD1000000027_S0000321	but this time felt different.
POD1000000027_S0000323	I remember I had said, this is really bad, really bad. And I knew something was going to happen. I didn't know what. It was like shock.
POD1000000027_S0000325	That's what we all were. Shocked. But we shouldn't have been surprised.
POD1000000029_S0000001	Facebook's had 15 months of quote fresh hell, but 2.1 billion still use it or Instagram or WhatsApp or Messenger every day.
POD1000000029_S0000002	From American Public Media, this is Marketplace Tech demystifying the digital economy. I'm Jack Stewart, in for Molly Wood.
POD1000000029_S0000004	Despite the privacy scandals, the federal investigations and the accusations of destroying democracy, this week Facebook reported its advertising revenue and global users are growing.
POD1000000029_S0000005	In this week's Quality Assurance, we take a deep dive into why. In its early years, Facebook prioritised growth over everything else.
POD1000000029_S0000006	Nearly every crisis Facebook now faces stems from that. Nicholas Thompson, editor-in-chief of Wired, says that's left management to navigate a metaphorical minefield.
POD1000000029_S0000007	There was a lot of unexploded ordnance that they were inevitably going to step on at some point.
POD1000000029_S0000008	He's an author on the magazine's latest cover story, which goes behind the scenes at the troubled company. He says Facebook's business is actually solid for a couple of reasons.
POD1000000029_S0000009	Number one, the advertising business model they came up with is one of the greatest ever. And it doesn't require lots of changes. They just built an amazing business model and the marginal costs of bringing in new advertisers are very low.
POD1000000029_S0000010	Secondly, one of the smartest business decisions that Mark Zuckerberg ever made was to buy Instagram. And people don't really understand that Instagram is owned by Facebook or if they distrust Facebook, they don't distrust Instagram. So Instagram continues to grow.
POD1000000029_S0000011	So they make lots of money off of Core Facebook. They have lots of user growth on Instagram and WhatsApp, and the business is doing great.
POD1000000029_S0000012	You would think at some point that maybe advertisers would start to push back I mean if Facebook's reputation has really taken this really huge dent that it appears it has Why do people still want to advertise with it?
POD1000000029_S0000013	Well, because the advertising continues to work. If at some point people have an icky feeling when they use Facebook and therefore the ads are less effective, then advertisers will leave.
POD1000000029_S0000014	But at this moment, Facebook allows you to very specifically target specific users in ways that you cannot on other platforms. And for lots of advertisers, that's just a deal that's too good to pass up.
POD1000000029_S0000015	Now, Facebook is anticipating what it says up to a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission. We heard that from it this week about how it's handled some of these privacy issues.
POD1000000029_S0000016	Will they even feel that, is the question. They have so much cash on hand, is it a big deal?
POD1000000029_S0000017	No, so Facebook put out in their earnings call. They said that they anticipate a three to five billion dollar fine I don't know whether that's because those are the numbers the FTC has been talking about with them or if Facebook is just trying to set expectations as a negotiating tactic
POD1000000029_S0000018	I would not rule out the possibility that Facebook is hit with a $10 billion fine or a $20 billion fine. Regardless to your question, even if it is at the higher end, whether it's 5 or 10 or 20, it's tiny.
POD1000000029_S0000019	Their market cap is up, I believe, $40 billion as we talked this morning. So it's not a huge hit to them. Obviously, they would rather have $5 billion than not have $5 billion, but they will be fine regardless of what this number comes out at.
POD1000000029_S0000020	The thing they really worry about is antitrust. If there is antitrust regulation and it comes down hard on them, that is a serious problem and that would make the market drop dramatically.
POD1000000029_S0000021	What are the stakes for Facebook's leadership around all of these scandals, the fake news, the offensive content, their privacy? You know, you detail that they've got something like 30,000 moderators now. Does that mean they're actually taking this seriously as a business risk?
POD1000000029_S0000022	Yes, absolutely. Facebook is taking it very seriously as a business risk. So there are two really interesting questions in there. So number one is, do they take this seriously as a business risk? Absolutely. Are they committed to trying to counter fake news and all of the manipulation on the platform?
POD1000000029_S0000023	Absolutely. What are the stakes to their business? They're very high. If the scandal continues to multiply, there could be real consequences down the road. What are the stakes specifically to top management, meaning Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the two people who we most associate with the company?
POD1000000029_S0000024	For Zuckerberg, he's going to run the company as long as he wants to. He has voting control of the shares. He's appointed his friends as board members. He is in a good position.
POD1000000029_S0000025	Whenever he wants to go and run the Chan Zuckerberg initiative or just go be an intellectual thought leader or do Bill Gates type things, he will go choose to do that. For Sandberg, it's tougher.
POD1000000029_S0000026	And there were moments in the last year where it seemed like she might be sacrificed or where she might be in big trouble. Zuckerberg has expressed his loyalty to her.
POD1000000029_S0000027	But as the scandals multiplied and as they started to touch her in a way they never had before, it seemed as though her position was at risk. And it is also certainly the case that the public reputation of both of them has dropped.
POD1000000029_S0000028	A year ago we were talking about each of them as potential presidential candidates. Now there's not a chance.
POD1000000029_S0000029	What about the morale in the wider company in the wake of all of this? Do you get the feeling from the people you've been talking to in your reporting that employees are fairly satisfied there? I'm laughing even as I say that. Or is there a whole lot of internal chaos at this company?
POD1000000029_S0000030	There is a lot more employee dissatisfaction than there was two years ago.
POD1000000029_S0000031	There are lots of employees who I talk to there who say, oh, this place is great. It's cool. You know, the media hates us, but that's not my problem. I'm happy. And there are a bunch of other people who say, you know, we deserve a lot of the hatred. We made a lot of mistakes.
POD1000000029_S0000032	We trampled on people's privacies and, you know, I regret all that we've done. I talked to a lot of people who are thinking about going to work there and it doesn't have the halo that it did two years ago.
POD1000000029_S0000033	They still pay you well. The fact that the stock continues to go up is great, particularly for people who have options.
POD1000000029_S0000034	But it is a less exciting place to work and that is one of the true risks for the company and one of the most adverse effects of the last two years for Facebook.
POD1000000029_S0000035	Did any part in this reporting, particularly given how much time you've spent on Facebook directly now, did anything really surprise you?
POD1000000029_S0000036	There was one specific story that stunned me, and that was the circumstances that led to the departure of the two founders of Instagram, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.
POD1000000029_S0000037	And when Fred Vogelstein and I started reporting the story, we made a list of the mysteries we wanted to solve. That was at the very top. Why had they left? It seems strange. They had left all of a sudden in September.
POD1000000029_S0000038	No one knew why and late in the reporting, you know months into reporting the story We finally learned the full story and that is that according to people close to them. They had grown frustrated Zuckerberg's increased meddling
POD1000000029_S0000039	They didn't like the idea that Instagram was going to be further merged with WhatsApp and with Facebook. And there was real tension over Instagram's growth.
POD1000000029_S0000040	And there was a sense among some people at Facebook that Instagram's growth was coming at the expense of core Facebook. And that led to all kinds of tensions and then a big fight at the end of July and a moment where Mark Zuckerberg
POD1000000029_S0000041	According to people observing all of this, Mark Zuckerberg asked one of his deputies to drop a list of all the ways that Facebook supported Instagram, the way it drove users towards Instagram.
POD1000000029_S0000042	And then he gave the list to Kevin Systrom and said, we're getting rid of all of these. And according to people familiar with the story, Systrom reacted quite badly to that. And then when on paternity leave, came back and said, I'm done here.
POD1000000029_S0000043	And so the biggest surprise to us was that the departure of Sister McCreager, which hadn't come out before, was much tenser, much tenser than I had believed when I began reporting this story.
POD1000000029_S0000044	Nick Thompson, editor-in-chief of Wired. For context, a $5 billion fine would be a record tech penalty in the US, beating the $22 million that Google had to pay in 2012.
POD1000000029_S0000046	And now for some related links. The New York Times has a good explainer on why both Facebook and the FTC would be happy with a chunky fine. One ends up looking strong, the other looks accountable, but really nothing much changes.
POD1000000029_S0000047	European regulators have been tougher on tech companies. Google, Facebook and Twitter all have to do more to tackle fake news to satisfy them, and they want to see progress ahead of EU elections next month, according to Reuters.
POD1000000029_S0000048	And even Canada's getting in on the action. According to the CBC this week, privacy regulators there say Facebook broke several laws over unauthorized data access. They plan to take the company to court.
POD1000000029_S0000049	If you enjoyed Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in front of Congress here in the US with his zinging comebacks like, Senator, we run ads, then maybe you'll enjoy hearing more directly from Mr. Zuckerberg himself.
POD1000000029_S0000050	I mean, Facebook was accused of not being open enough. I'm not really sure how deep into the heads of tech entrepreneurs you really want to get, but Zuck does have a podcast now. I'm not suggesting you listen, I'm just giving you this information
POD1000000029_S0000051	It's called Tech and Society with Mark Zuckerberg. Just… yeah, don't at me. Matt Purdy produced this week's Marketplace Tech along with Stephanie Hughes and Yves Trou is our Senior Producer.
POD1000000029_S0000053	I'm Jack Stewart, for now, that's Marketplace Tech.
POD1000000029_S0000055	This is APM.
POD1000000033_S0000001	If you want to get broadband access to every state, you got to know the local laws. From American Public Media, this is Marketplace Tech demystifying the digital economy. I'm Molly Wood.
POD1000000033_S0000003	The digital economy, as we like to call it over here, depends pretty heavily on access to the Internet. And that is still not a solved problem here in the United States.
POD1000000033_S0000004	Over 30 percent of Americans don't have access to broadband internet, which is defined as 25 megabits per second or higher. That's according to research released Tuesday by the NPD Group.
POD1000000033_S0000005	The Pew Charitable Trusts has an initiative dedicated to figuring out why this is the case. Today, the organization's Broadband Research Initiative is launching a new tool that lets anyone browse through broadband policies and funding in any state in the U.S.
POD1000000033_S0000006	It sorts the information in categories like funding, competition and regulation, infrastructure access, and broadband definitions.
POD1000000033_S0000007	Like in Alabama, for example, broadband speed is defined as only 10 megabits per second. If your network is busy, that's barely fast enough to stream Netflix in high def.
POD1000000033_S0000008	Katherine DeWitt manages the Broadband Research Initiative for Pew Charitable Trusts. She told me state policy is a huge deal when it comes to expanding broadband access.
POD1000000033_S0000009	State policy matters because lack of access to broadband is a national issue, but it is felt at the local level. And states have taken a pretty aggressive approach to closing gaps in access, particularly over the last five years.
POD1000000033_S0000010	We've seen a significant uptick in legislation since 2015. And what we can take away from this is not only do state policymakers see and feel that immediate urgency of lack of broadband access,
POD1000000033_S0000011	They're saying it's important to things like education, health care, and economic development, but they're also saying this is what we want our state to look like. They're setting goals and then they're laying out a path and a framework for how to achieve those goals.
POD1000000033_S0000012	Let's just dive into some of what is in the tool, some of the different approaches that states are taking. Could you give me an example of two totally different approaches that states might have taken?
POD1000000033_S0000013	So going into this research, we knew that states faced similar challenges in increasing access to broadband, but we learned that they're also taking similar approaches but adapting them to their needs. That's really where those categories came from, those groupings.
POD1000000033_S0000014	If you look at goals, for example, you have states like Minnesota and West Virginia where their statewide broadband goals are focused on border-to-border universal coverage.
POD1000000033_S0000015	Then you look at a state like California that has a goal to connect 98% of the population in each one of its roughly 20 regions.
POD1000000033_S0000016	How do you hope that a tool like this can help close the digital divide in terms of broadband access?
POD1000000033_S0000017	Well, this tool is actually the first step in our ongoing research on how states are addressing gaps in broadband access. So for us, this was about understanding that 50-state landscape of broadband deployment laws.
POD1000000033_S0000018	And it provides the basis for our next level of research, which is a deeper examination of how states are addressing those gaps in access.
POD1000000033_S0000019	What we hope though is that users will be able to use this tool to learn what other states are doing and how they're actually doing it.
POD1000000033_S0000020	Katherine DeWitt manages the broadband research initiative for the Pew Charitable Trusts. We've got a link to that new tool and some analysis about spending per state at our website, marketplacetech.org.
POD1000000033_S0000022	And now for some related links. So this tool is super new, obviously, and Pew hopes that policymakers and local governments will jump in and start creating some more analysis and comparison. And of course, they'll be publishing their own pieces.
POD1000000033_S0000023	The first one that I mentioned there is about how states fund their broadband projects, whether it's grants or loans or general fund kind of things, or some creative funding.
POD1000000033_S0000024	Apparently, Illinois makes Internet service providers pay into a special coffer called the Digital Divide Elimination Fund, and it uses that to pay for broadband buildouts.
POD1000000033_S0000025	And in Virginia, a legal settlement with tobacco producers is paying to build more internet.
POD1000000033_S0000026	Look, I'm not saying this isn't a little wonky over here, but it is interesting. Also, I gotta be honest, I'm still hung up on that 10 megabits per second in Alabama and probably some other states too. I haven't made it through the entire tool yet.
POD1000000033_S0000027	But Alabama's regulation also says ISPs can call their upload speeds broadband at one megabit per second. So basically, if you're at home trying to upload some photos to Facebook or anything to the cloud ever,
POD1000000033_S0000028	You'd be doing that at speeds 10 times slower than the slowest 4G cell phone connection. Set it and forget it, because it's going to take all night.
POD1000000033_S0000029	Now this speed question is so controversial that even though Pew is using the 25 megabit per second speed guideline which is set by the Federal Communications Commission, network congestion usually means actual speeds are nowhere near that fast.
POD1000000033_S0000030	And again, a 4G phone connection is faster than that on the best providers.
POD1000000033_S0000031	It is such a big discrepancy that while Pew says 21 million Americans don't have broadband, Microsoft put out its own map of high-speed Internet access back in April.
POD1000000033_S0000032	It said the real number of people without appropriately fast internet access for today's economy is more like 163 million in the United States alone.
POD1000000033_S0000034	I'm Molly Wood and that's Marketplace Tech.
POD1000000033_S0000036	This is APM.
POD1000000038_S0000001	Let's take a break from real life for a moment to visit the somewhat near future on TV.
POD1000000038_S0000002	Although I have to warn you, that's kinda dark too.
POD1000000038_S0000003	From American Public Media, this is Marketplace Tech demystifying the digital economy. I'm Mollie Wood.
POD1000000038_S0000005	The BBC-HBO show Years and Years combines the politics, economy and tech of 2019 and imagines how it all might evolve over the next 15 years.
POD1000000038_S0000006	Emma Thompson is in it as a celebrity British politician with autocratic leanings, but mainly the show follows a family as they deal with the world changing around them.
POD1000000038_S0000007	Russell T. Davis created and wrote Years and Years. He's also worked on the shows Doctor Who, Torchwood, and created Queer as Folk.
POD1000000038_S0000008	He said the tech in years and years is like life. It's complicated.
POD1000000038_S0000010	show good and bad. I think some of the saddest moments it's you have a world war being announced on television and the little five six year old kids just sit staring into their phones playing their games.
POD1000000038_S0000011	So yes, there's bad stuff, but that's very easy to talk about. And yet there's very, very good stuff. I tell you, actually, when I made the choice to center this around a family,
POD1000000038_S0000012	That came from one of the good sides of Current Tech, which is very simply the WhatsApp group. I'm one of three kids, there's two sisters, they've got two kids each. We're a nice family, we all like each other, we get on.
POD1000000038_S0000013	But up until a couple of years ago, my nieces had grown up. Two, three years ago, I would have texted them twice a year, happy birthday and Merry Christmas. Now, oh my God, I went out the other night and I came back to the WhatsApp group to 53 messages.
POD1000000038_S0000015	because someone had cooked a lasagna with butternut squash. So yes, there's good stuff. If you choose either good or either bad, you're not a very good writer. You've got to get both in there because in the end, it's not the technology, it's the people.
POD1000000038_S0000016	Well, it's great because some of the tech feels really immediate, like a headband that projects a holographic sort of Snapchat filter for your face that everyone can see in the physical world. It's futuristic, but it's also completely realistic.
POD1000000038_S0000017	Yes, yes, I think if that was invented tomorrow, we'd all go and buy one. I mean, I find those filters fascinating.
POD1000000038_S0000019	sends each other's photos of themselves looking like a dog.
POD1000000038_S0000021	rash of Instagram filters like what dog are you or what cake are you? I'm certainly a Battenberg. But I love those filters and I'm fascinated by the way we love those filters.
POD1000000038_S0000022	And so the moment someone invents a filter you can see in the real world, not just on your phone. Oh my God, I would be phoning you from my palace on the moon.
POD1000000038_S0000023	Do you have conflicting feelings about tech or is it like so many things where it just reflects the real world?
POD1000000038_S0000024	Yeah, it's interesting that. I think it's both. I think you have to be entertaining. But entertaining doesn't mean being glib or daft. I think I'm getting older. I think my stuff is full of warnings now, to be honest. It's funny I'm now in the middle of an edit of my next drama.
POD1000000038_S0000026	HBO Max over there which is about the AIDS crisis of the 1980s.
POD1000000038_S0000028	I've just watched an edit of an episode warning about viruses and we step out of our front doors and there's a virus on the loose. You can't learn those lessons from history enough. Strange, isn't it? What a world.
POD1000000038_S0000029	I was telling people that I'm taking a little bit of comfort in a darker timeline, but there is something comforting about the passage of time, right? Like you fast forward in these episodes and increasingly terrible things happen, but also
POD1000000038_S0000030	people are still living their normal lives. Talk to me about that sense of perspective.
POD1000000038_S0000031	Yes, that's right. I mean, it was quite a hard show to sell initially with its concept of moving forward in time and every episode moves forward a year. But actually I sat there saying,
POD1000000038_S0000033	been quested about it 57 times
POD1000000038_S0000035	Do you know what else moves forward a year in every episode? Downton Abbey.
POD1000000038_S0000036	And so did Upstairs Downstairs many years ago. It's actually not a format of drama I've invented. It's simply the fact that this drama is going to the future by a year every episode that had people scared. But in terms of drama, in terms of how the characters are getting on, who loves who.
POD1000000038_S0000037	who's going out with who, who's cross with who, who loves who. To take yearly jumps in that is a very simple dramatic device.
POD1000000038_S0000038	I knew that would work. I had the confidence of those four bears to say this will work.
POD1000000038_S0000039	And it was to get that sort of creep into the story, which is
POD1000000038_S0000041	in societies when dictators arise or where huge changes are made and where society might swing from left to right or right to left, it doesn't happen overnight. That's why I wanted
POD1000000038_S0000042	what ends up as like a 15 year span on the show is to show these things slowly creeping up on you. And actually you're more concerned with having your tea or falling in love.
POD1000000038_S0000043	or having a divorce, that's actually the stuff, the meat and drink of your life, while the bigger shadows are falling on you unseen. So I needed that stretch to show the small picture of people living within a bigger picture.
POD1000000038_S0000044	So episode six introduces a virus and with the coronavirus happening right now, is that something you would have done differently?
POD1000000038_S0000045	in the show or is that just one of the many sort of things going on in the future?
POD1000000038_S0000046	It's interesting because actually it comes up in episode six as a means of isolating people within the story. To be honest, now I'm seeing a virus like this in action.
POD1000000038_S0000047	It would have dominated episode six too much actually. It's amazing how it dominates our every conversation now. And episode six as a drama, not as a document of the real world, but as a drama has stories to wrap up.
POD1000000038_S0000049	We need to know.
POD1000000038_S0000050	whether lovers will be reunited, whether marriages will stay together. So it's very interesting now that I sort of think that, I mean, I had done a lot of research into viruses and what would happen. So I kind of, you know, I knew the differences between endemics and pandemics.
POD1000000038_S0000051	but I chose to background it and this is a separate drama itself really. My goodness this is strange days again. Just keep getting madder. What did we used to talk about in 2006? What? What did we talk about? Can you remember? Interest rates?
POD1000000038_S0000052	Cows and cattle. What did we talk about? Guinea pigs? I don't know.
POD1000000038_S0000053	I can't remember what we talked about two weeks ago even. I mean, do you feel anxious? Like when you reach inside creatively and pull out
POD1000000038_S0000054	what in some ways is like the worst case scenario that we're imagining in our brains and put them on screen. Does that make you anxious?
POD1000000038_S0000056	I talk to my family, that lovely family I was just describing. One of my nieces just had twins, one year ago. They had lovely, lovely baby twins. And that makes me anxious. I kind of look at them thinking,
POD1000000038_S0000057	You know, I do believe in global warming. I do believe we're in trouble. I do believe that as a result, the political situation, I think the heating up of our political situation is tied into global warming.
POD1000000038_S0000058	on a vast scale, that's very... And for the first time in my life, you look at little kids thinking, I'm not sure you'll have a better world. I'm not sure at all you will. So I have got an anxiety, and as a writer, that is bound to come out in my work.
POD1000000038_S0000059	I do have to say that years and years does have a happy ending, a happy-ish ending, a sort of bittersweet but is a happy ending because I also believe in that. I think real life could be disastrous enough and I think when you're writing fiction you should reach for a happy ending.
POD1000000038_S0000060	because it's hard work. Happy endings are tough to find and miserable endings are easy. So I try to look for hope in it. And I do have hope in people actually that
POD1000000038_S0000061	We are great survivors and great thinkers and actually I think most people are nice. I think people are fundamentally nice. That word we're not allowed to use, nice, because it seems like a bland word but I think it's a beautiful word. People are nice.
POD1000000038_S0000062	and I have to hope that our niceness prevails.
POD1000000038_S0000063	Russell T. Davis created and wrote years and years.
POD1000000038_S0000065	for some related links. If you had not heard of Years and Years like me, you are really not alone. It did show up on a bunch of end of 2019 lists as some of the year's best TV,
POD1000000038_S0000066	And Wired's geek guide to the galaxy had a piece from last month about discovering the show and how great the characters and the technology are. You'll find a link to that on our website, marketplacetech.org.
POD1000000038_S0000068	And here's what else we're watching in tech. Tech stocks have been the beating heart of the stock market for quite a stretch now. But the famous five, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet,
POD1000000038_S0000069	lost a combined $400 billion on Thursday, as Wall Street had its worst day since 1987. On the plus side, the founder of Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer that makes much of Apple's components,
POD1000000038_S0000070	said it was coming back online faster than expected after being closed due to the coronavirus outbreak. As more and more people start to work from home, we're keeping an eye on what's happening with internet connections and IT support.
POD1000000038_S0000071	We'll have more on that next week, but in Italy, Bloomberg reports that Italy's national internet network has seen a two-thirds increase in traffic. And that's with the country's schools closed,
POD1000000038_S0000072	And, with the country's schools closed, apparently a lot of that traffic is coming from people playing the multiplayer games Fortnite and Call of Duty.
POD1000000038_S0000074	senior editor. Robin Edgar is our engineer. We had production help from Candice Manriquez this week.
POD1000000038_S0000075	And like a lot of you, we were all working remotely for part of this week and everybody did fantastic. We're going to be hearing a lot more about how to work from home in the coming weeks.
POD1000000038_S0000076	Here are some quick do's and don'ts for Zoom meetings based on what I'm hearing from some workplaces. Do mute your microphone and wear a shirt. Do not change your background to funny things while the boss is talking because you got bored.
POD1000000038_S0000077	don't try to get a private tour of people's bedrooms, and don't conduct your meetings while lying on the couch. It's still work, people. It's still work.
POD1000000038_S0000078	I'm Molly Wood and that's Marketplace Tech. Have a safe and healthy weekend or as I saw it put on Twitter

POD1000000047_S0000000	Welcome to the 80,000 Hours podcast. This interview with David Spiegelhalter is a bit unusual in that it was actually recorded two years ago.
POD1000000047_S0000002	We were considering starting a podcast back then and I recorded this trial episode with my colleague, Jess Whittlestone, but ultimately we didn't have the time to go ahead with the project. But I thought, why not dig it up and release it now?
POD1000000047_S0000004	David Spiegelholder is a statistician at the University of Cambridge and something of an academic celebrity in the UK.
POD1000000047_S0000006	Part of his role is to improve the public understanding of risk, especially everyday risks we face like getting cancer or dying in a car crash. As a result, he's regularly in the media, explaining the numbers in the news.
POD1000000047_S0000007	trying to assist both ordinary people and politicians to focus on the most important risks that confront us and avoid being distracted by flashy risks that perhaps don't actually have that much impact.
POD1000000047_S0000009	To help make sense of the uncertainties we face in life, he's had to invent concepts like the micro life or a 30 minute change in life expectancy.
POD1000000047_S0000011	We gave him a call because we wanted to learn whether he thought a lifetime of work had actually made that much difference to the world. Enjoy.
POD1000000047_S0000013	Here at the Centre for Effective Altruism, we're interested in finding ways to compare what it means to do good and to figure out which ways of doing good do the most good. So we ask questions like, which charity should you donate to if you want to help as many people as possible?
POD1000000047_S0000014	What careers should you follow if you want to improve the world? And which cause areas have the largest impact? These are the sorts of questions that we think it's really important to get clear so you know how you can make a real difference.
POD1000000047_S0000016	To help us answer some of these questions, we're joined by Professor David Spiegelhalter, the Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University. Professor Spiegelhalter spent much of his life trying to improve public understanding of statistics, science, and risk in ordinary life.
POD1000000047_S0000018	He regularly appears in the UK media and writes on his blog, Understanding Uncertainty. It's great to have you with us today, David.
POD1000000047_S0000019	Bye.
POD1000000047_S0000021	So we've got so many things we'd like to talk about. We'll see how far we get. But first, tell us a bit about who you are and your position.
POD1000000047_S0000022	Yeah, I've got a strange job really. I'm in the maths department at Cambridge and I teach statistics to the undergraduates, but I'm actually funded by a hedge fund, Winston Capital Management, and have endowed my chair in order to improve
POD1000000047_S0000023	The public understanding of statistics and risk and so what I have done since I've had that job for the last eight years is I supposed to try to join the general community of people who are.
POD1000000047_S0000024	trying to improve the way numbers in particular are discussed in society.
POD1000000047_S0000026	So what kinds of questions do you research and what outreach do you do to help the public understand numbers and uncertainty better?
POD1000000047_S0000027	Well, I get asked to do a huge amount of stuff. I suppose helping in various agencies, communicating risk about the sort of cancer risk, about the risk of screening, for example, risks and benefits of screening. My background is in medical statistics.
POD1000000047_S0000028	That's what I get to do quite a lot. I've done TV programmes about climate change, radio stuff about all sorts of threats to society, Fukushima and so on.
POD1000000047_S0000029	and everything to do with trying to get a handle on what are the important threats to us individually and how we might be able to make comparisons between those.
POD1000000047_S0000030	I'm very interested in, rather than the great global existential risks, I'm more interested in the things that affect us all individually, about how we eat, our exercise, transport and so on.
POD1000000047_S0000032	So yeah, one of the things that I find really interesting in this area is that there's a lot of evidence that people tend to be very poor at estimating lots of different probabilities and so end up
POD1000000047_S0000033	overestimating the scale of some problems or risks that they face and underestimating others. From your experience, what kinds of problems do you think that people tend to be most prone to overestimate or underestimate and get wrong in very harmful ways?
POD1000000047_S0000034	Well, there's been a lot of research on this by psychologists, as you know, and of course, when we talk about people, I always include myself in this.
POD1000000047_S0000035	I'm subject to the whims of my emotional gut reactions as much as anybody else. I'm not making any claim about some superior knowledge and rationality compared with everybody else.
POD1000000047_S0000036	We just know that the way we respond to things, to simplify a lot, we can think in two different ways. We can respond to that in guts or we can try to engage our brain and think slowly about stuff.
POD1000000047_S0000037	This is so relevant when it comes to risk, particularly this idea that what's available to us is very strong.
POD1000000047_S0000038	What we hear in the news, we hear about Ebola, we hear about terrorism, we hear about the latest threats that might be in what we eat and the way we travel. And we get very concerned about this, whether it's a plane crash or whatever.
POD1000000047_S0000039	And because that's what's in the news, that's what is available to us, that's what's so prominent. But of course, so many of these risks are actually very small indeed. This is not a threat to us particularly at all.
POD1000000047_S0000040	and the things that are much more familiar, we don't hear much of, you know, for example, just heart disease, cancer, all those sort of stuff that we get a large amount of that is because of the way we live, our lack of exercise, our crummy diet.
POD1000000047_S0000041	and so on. Of course, people get a bit bored with that and don't get so concerned about it.
POD1000000047_S0000042	Do you feel you've had any success improving public understanding of risks and getting people to focus on the stuff that really matters?
POD1000000047_S0000043	Oh, I don't know. It's very difficult to measure. I mean, it'd be great to think so. I've been involved in some good projects that I've been very proud of, for example, the redesign of the cancer screening leaflets in the UK, which present the benefits and risks of
POD1000000047_S0000044	cancer screening in a very balanced way. They are hugely innovative in that they don't actually recommend people go for screening. They just say, well, these are the possible benefits.
POD1000000047_S0000045	These are the possible harms. Make up your own mind. And I believe that's the right way to go about communicating risk. It's not to say, oh, you've got to watch out, you've got to watch out, this is terrible. Say, well, if you do this, this might happen or it might not happen.
POD1000000047_S0000046	and weigh it up and actually give people credit for some intelligence, which I think people basically are. Don't think people are so stupid. What I am proud of is being part of a general community that's very strong in Britain to do with public engagement in science.
POD1000000047_S0000047	And...
POD1000000047_S0000049	which is I'm just a small part of that because it's covers the material on the radio, stuff on television, stuff in some newspapers and in various agencies, for example the Statistics Authority.
POD1000000047_S0000050	which is just trying to take a much more critical attitude to the way that numbers and evidence are used in society. And I think it works in Britain. We're rather good compared with most people about
POD1000000047_S0000052	don't have these massive fears of vaccinations, of nuclear power, of even GMOs. And so I think this is a sign that we in this country have developed quite a good public engagement with science communities.
POD1000000047_S0000054	I was actually going to ask you about what potential you think there is for young people who want to have an impact with their career going into a career path similar to your own and trying to get into public outreach and engagement.
POD1000000047_S0000055	to have a broader impact rather than necessarily just doing research in academia. So how hard do you think it is to do this kind of thing? It sounds like this is definitely something you wish more academics did work on.
POD1000000047_S0000056	Absolutely. I've only come to it quite late as a real part of my career, as I said, again, because a philanthropist in a hedge fund provided the funding for me to be able to do this full-time.
POD1000000047_S0000057	But I was doing some before as part of my job. And I increasingly feel that it's actually a duty of academics who after all are publicly funded for a certain proportion of them to really spend some time on public engagement. It doesn't suit everybody.
POD1000000047_S0000058	not credible at all, although I think everybody should have a website explaining what they do. And that this should be also supported and there should be incentives within the career structure for academics to do this
POD1000000047_S0000059	And I'm quite pleased that in Cambridge, for example, when we're looking at promotion of people, their public engagement is taken very seriously indeed. And it's something I strongly support. So it's not for everybody, but I think it is a very important thing for academics to do.
POD1000000047_S0000060	as they're doing their work, in whatever area it has a relevance to society and it can potentially
POD1000000047_S0000062	improve society and they should be working on it.
POD1000000047_S0000063	I personally think that statistics is a particularly important area for improvement of society. I feel this very strongly and many statisticians do. In terms of public engagement,
POD1000000047_S0000064	the Royal Statistical Society has now got an initiative of training up statistics ambassadors, young statisticians who want to do this, who really want to get out there and communicate the importance of their work and try to improve the way things are done with numbers and evidence.
POD1000000047_S0000065	I think this is so exciting, such fun.
POD1000000047_S0000067	So a lot of young people we meet are thinking of going into academia. Do you feel like that's a good place to be to have a big impact in the world? Of course there are also some drawbacks that you might be aware of from your experience of being in academia.
POD1000000047_S0000068	Yes, I wouldn't necessarily say to recommend, yes, you really should go into academia. It doesn't suit everybody and frankly, the people that I started, it's quite nice. It's very tough now.
POD1000000047_S0000069	As with most careers, there seem to be a lot more pressures on them than there used to be. So it can be quite a tough call, I think. But there is potential to do a lot of good stuff. The people I work with know in other areas, whether they're working in
POD1000000047_S0000070	natural natural, you know, natural threats, natural disasters, whether you're working in botany, whether you're working in any area, plant sciences, whatever, are really dedicated to trying to improve
POD1000000047_S0000071	the lot of the world and I'm so impressed by their dedication. But it is a tough job and you don't necessarily see in this sort of push to publish the work, you've got to do all this, got to go through all this.
POD1000000047_S0000073	all this business in order to build one's career, it doesn't necessarily appear at first that you're actually doing great good in what you do. Very little of it you can see a direct impact. However, as I know that what's very good about it is that it
POD1000000047_S0000074	it is building a lot of transferable skills that you can use. I find that in my statistical skills, for example, are in a massive demand by all sorts of agencies. I could point in particular to the
POD1000000047_S0000075	importance of the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals which are
POD1000000047_S0000076	which are replacing them, in which the sort of monitoring of the state of welfare in different countries around the world has become absolutely vital and just being able to measure things and know what's going on and
POD1000000047_S0000077	to develop good ways to do surveys, to actually look at what works, how you can improve these measures, has become enormously vital, enormously important. So I think, well again I'm coming back to the fact that I think statistics is
POD1000000047_S0000078	a particularly valuable area to go into.
POD1000000047_S0000080	Yeah, absolutely. And just a little bit more broadly, you know, the key idea behind Effector Altruism is that we want to try and figure out which altruistic activities, which charities, which career paths, which causes do the most good. And we think that being able to
POD1000000047_S0000081	measure things or at least trying to measure things is incredibly valuable in making progress on those questions. But obviously these are many of these questions are incredibly difficult to answer so a common criticism that we often get is people saying something like
POD1000000047_S0000082	oh it's impossible to figure out which charities or careers do the most good so you're wasting your tough trying and you should just go with your gut or you know help personal causes. What do you think of this kind of objection and do you think that there's anything to it?
POD1000000047_S0000083	you know, concern about there being too much uncertainty. You know, we often respond by saying that, you know, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't try and estimation is clearly the best we have. But yeah, what are your thoughts on this challenge? And
POD1000000047_S0000085	I mean this is not a comment that's just restricted to the area that you're talking about. It happens all the time. It used to happen in healthcare. People used to say, oh you can't put a value on a human life.
POD1000000047_S0000086	We've just got to do all we can to do good if we have to just go with our guts, essentially. That view now, certainly in the UK, has been completely discredited. You can put a value on a human life, we do, all the time.
POD1000000047_S0000087	Not sure everyone would agree, but...
POD1000000047_S0000088	Not for everyone you can agree and of course.
POD1000000047_S0000089	But you have to.
POD1000000047_S0000090	But NICE for example has been doing this for over a decade.
POD1000000047_S0000092	putting a value on the marginal benefit of a particular healthcare intervention and assessing what should be supported under the National Health Service according to these formal criteria. Now we know this is not perfect, we know this does not measure everything,
POD1000000047_S0000093	But it's explicit, it's transparent, and they've done their best, and I think it's been a massive success and a huge example to other countries as to how you can go about it. Now, we know it's never perfect, it's never perfect.
POD1000000047_S0000094	But, of course, people have been trying to take that approach, which I think has been extremely beneficial and healthy, and move it into other areas. Now, how can you do it so people are trying to do it with the environment? How can we measure the value of a tree? Well, people are trying to measure the value of a tree.
POD1000000047_S0000095	I don't know what the trees were, there was quite a lot.
POD1000000047_S0000097	working out all these different, trying to measure the benefit of a healthy, sustainable environment, etc. What's the value of a species?
POD1000000047_S0000098	It's too easy to sit back and say, oh you can't do it, you can't measure that. Well, you can have a good go. So as you say, it's always a balance between trying your best, realising you're never going to be able to do it,
POD1000000047_S0000099	but not to be put off having a good go. So it's like a lot of things we do in statistics, trying to measure things, trying to model things, that we always know what we do is inadequate, but that doesn't mean you can't do useful things.
POD1000000047_S0000101	Can you tell us a bit more about NICE and how they prioritise health treatments within the United Kingdom?
POD1000000047_S0000102	That's something I've worked on as a medical statistician. I've been a huge supporter of NICE. Essentially, what they do is when they decide whether to have a new vaccine or whether to decide to have a new recommended
POD1000000047_S0000103	for drugs to be paid for under the NHS, for example, they will look at what is the expected benefit of that intervention and what's the expected cost. And then they look at how much it's going to cost to
POD1000000047_S0000104	and provide an extra what they call a quality, a quality adjusted life year. So one year of life that's discounted if it's poor quality, you will, you know, you'll discount it won't be worth the whole year. And then essentially they can make the comparison
POD1000000047_S0000105	and they look if something comes in at less than £20,000 a quali, it just almost is paid for, you know, just yep, fine, we'll pay for it under the NHS. If it's more than about £30,000, then they really try to
POD1000000047_S0000107	we don't want to pay for this.
POD1000000047_S0000108	and try to go back to the drug company to renegotiate a price, for example, between 20,000 and 30,000. Well, you know, that's more in the grey zone. So, and this has been enormously beneficial, partly
POD1000000047_S0000109	in order to go back to drug companies and get them to reduce their prices. But and also to see that some interventions, for example, cancer screening, come in extremely cheap. They're just worth doing. It also means you have to be explicit, for example, on how much you value the future
POD1000000047_S0000110	rather than the present because they put in a discount rate, currently 3.5%. Now that means that a year of life in 25 years time, for example, is only worth about half what a year of life now is worth. And that's taken into account.
POD1000000047_S0000111	And now that of course is controversial. And if we're talking about big policy decisions for example about climate change that's far too big a discount rate. We wouldn't care less about the world in 100 years time if we use that discount. So in different areas.
POD1000000047_S0000112	you might be wanting to use a different disk. But these are taking economic ideas and moving them into very human decisions.
POD1000000047_S0000113	and I think they are enormously helpful and illuminating, but they're never perfect.
POD1000000047_S0000115	Yeah, I've actually written an article with Professor Toby Ord about why we shouldn't discount health, even though we should discount financial returns, about why it's appropriate in one case and not in the other. So we'll put up a link to that on the website.
POD1000000047_S0000116	A lot of people who are planning out their careers, they feel just overwhelmed by uncertainty. They don't know how much they're going to earn in one career, or what's the chances of getting into academia, or being elected to parliament.
POD1000000047_S0000117	How do you think people ought to make decisions when they're just surrounded by so much uncertainty?
POD1000000047_S0000118	Well, I mean you could say that we're always surrounded by this again, this is common to everything we do. We never know what's going to happen in the future, which is great. People don't want to know what's going to happen in the future. People don't even know what they're going to get for Christmas, let alone what's going to happen for the rest of their lives.
POD1000000047_S0000119	And so this is just a common problem. And we need to distinguish what we might call risk and uncertainty. Risk is when it's a very well defined problem, short term issues, buying lottery tickets when we know what the chances are.
POD1000000047_S0000120	then we can sort of take a rational approach. When we're dealing with deeper uncertainty, when we're really not even sure what the options are, how our lives might develop, then it's very difficult to take a completely formal approach. And so I wouldn't
POD1000000047_S0000121	try to say, oh, we should be able to do all this mathematically at all. However, the basics, those qualitative ideas of thinking through a rational decision are still very valuable because you think of, you know, what are the options available?
POD1000000047_S0000122	what are the possibilities and what are the possible consequences of what I might do. Now, that's always inadequate. You're never going to be able to think of everything. However, by thinking through that, some things might become immediately apparent, some immediate rankings of
POD1000000047_S0000123	what is preferable and not preferable might become apparent. And otherwise, we might need to fall back on broader strategies for making decisions in the face of
POD1000000047_S0000124	what we call deeper uncertainty. This is a deeply contested area. When governments make policies, very often they're in these situations where they can't even think of all the things that might happen. So they're in this situation of deeper uncertainty.
POD1000000047_S0000125	and people have suggested various ways to go about it. The first thing is not to think that you can optimize. You can't be perfect. You cannot be perfect. So the sort of suggestions that people make in terms of general decision making in these contexts
POD1000000047_S0000126	So to do with flexibility and resilience, that you want to be, you don't want to commit yourself to something you're not going to be able to change because you can't predict everything that's going to happen. So you're going to build in flexibility and adaptivity to your decision.
POD1000000047_S0000127	That's the same in any business, any government, any project at all. The other thing is to build in resilience in which you essentially can cope with the unexpected. That means both the possibility of really good things happening
POD1000000047_S0000128	as well as the possibility of really bad things happening. You are making sure that you haven't put all your eggs in one basket, essentially, so if something goes wrong, you haven't completely gone up a total blind alley that you can't renegotiate.
POD1000000047_S0000129	which means operating from the most robust basis as possible. So it means not trying to optimise the single path, but building in robustness, which means, I think in terms of career, of course, building in
POD1000000047_S0000130	transferable skills that you're going to be able to use in a variety of circumstances. So I think these are standard tactics for responding to deeper uncertainty, which can be used in any situation.
POD1000000047_S0000132	Yeah, that's definitely something that the organisation 80,000 Hours who advise people on how to have a big impact with their careers really focus on, especially early in your career, keep your options open, choose things that are robust under lots of different possible things happening.
POD1000000047_S0000134	One other question that we find we come up against a fair amount in thinking about careers and charities and all kinds of things is, you know, how do you go about choosing between a small chance of some really huge outcome, like, you know, saving the world from a pandemic that kills millions?
POD1000000047_S0000136	against some high probability of a very moderate or a more moderate outcome, so you know helping people in your local community. This seems like a very difficult thing to deal with. Do you have any thoughts on how people can go about making these kinds of decisions?
POD1000000047_S0000137	Yeah, very difficult, but again, these are common decisions always in our lives. Do we go for the high-risk option or the safer option? I personally think that
POD1000000047_S0000138	A mixed strategy is something that businesses would recommend, although I'm not involved in any investment decisions. Often, people would take an idea of a portfolio
POD1000000047_S0000139	of risk-taking, because these are all risks, you can't guarantee that you're going to do anything. You might have invested in rather safe things with a safe return, you're pretty sure that
POD1000000047_S0000140	what you're going to do is going to have a reasonable return and really you can predict the consequences of what you're using your career or your money for, what you're giving for. On the other hand, on more speculative
POD1000000047_S0000141	where you might be supporting something that actually might not come to anything either because the solution is promising.
POD1000000047_S0000142	won't work or the threat won't arise in the first place. So I think that's a mixed strategy in these circumstances. Again, you know, I wouldn't want to just put all the eggs in one basket.
POD1000000047_S0000144	I also personally feel that I quite like a mixed strategy in which some things are, the bigger
POD1000000047_S0000146	slightly anonymous.
POD1000000047_S0000147	where you're giving money
POD1000000047_S0000149	large organization is doing something which is contributing in a probably predictable way to improving things for people versus the more personal ones where you do have the personal
POD1000000047_S0000150	contact. And you might get a slightly more sort of emotional feedback from that, partly because that might encourage you to perhaps take on a more good feedback from the altruism, might encourage you to take on a bigger altruism.
POD1000000047_S0000151	a bigger commitment in the future.
POD1000000047_S0000153	So there are various ways of thinking about how to quantify the risks or possible gains associated with an activity. Can you explain what a micro-mort or a micro-life is?
POD1000000047_S0000154	Oh yeah, these are units that, well we invented the micro life, someone else invented the micro mort. It's just a way of trying to get a common scale for, in particular the case of micro mort is acute risks, the things that might kill you on the spot, but otherwise you're healthy.
POD1000000047_S0000155	and it's a one in a million chance of dying because of an action you might take. So, skydiving or something is approximately 7, 10 microwatts. And micro life, which is something to do with chronic risks, which is the risk of
POD1000000047_S0000156	I think there's stuff I'm quite interested in, which is bad lifestyle. Lack of exercise, smoking, drinking, bad diet, whatever, which isn't going to kill you on the spot.
POD1000000047_S0000157	will, is likely to shorten your life. Not definitely at all, maybe not, but probably will. And so it's a reduction of half an hour in your life expectancy. I find these quite useful because it enables you to compare all these different
POD1000000047_S0000158	things like diet and smoking and exercise and things and makes me for example, you know, smoking is where you get the biggest return or the biggest, you know, in terms of not smoking, the biggest return. And a
POD1000000047_S0000160	drinking at low doses, well actually it doesn't make much difference.
POD1000000047_S0000162	huge concern unless you're really sweetening it down. But exercise again is extremely important and diet is important.
POD1000000047_S0000163	it just gives you a feeling of what's, you know, where the, you know, where the priorities are, which of course, it's all a bit obvious. They're the priorities that people do in public health, but it makes you slightly unconcerned about other things that people might be really concerned about.
POD1000000047_S0000165	So these concepts were invented to help people get a better understanding and make better decisions. Do you think that we could invent new concepts to help people think about how they can do more good in the world?
POD1000000047_S0000167	Yeah, a micro altruism.
POD1000000047_S0000169	It's difficult. I mean the quality is a good one. If you're really if you're if your area of cause is to do with saving lives and improving health and lethal risk to people then qualities is a good one. It's already established. You can look at how many
POD1000000047_S0000171	So how many years of life are you going to gain from your intervention? And we know that if you're giving money to some particular charities,
POD1000000047_S0000173	promote
POD1000000047_S0000174	you know, they're extremely cost effective in that way.
POD1000000047_S0000175	It's more difficult if you have a broader idea, for example, of supporting education, of preserving the natural environment and so on, quite how to put a number on that within a particular area of cause.
POD1000000047_S0000176	the cause then you might be able to do it but having metrics that
POD1000000047_S0000178	go right across different areas.
POD1000000047_S0000180	difficult. I know that people criticize that
POD1000000047_S0000182	attempt to do it.
POD1000000047_S0000183	I still think it's worth trying to do.
POD1000000047_S0000185	within the environment and so on. I don't think I've got any great idea to be honest. One possibility of course is
POD1000000047_S0000186	is looking at general measures of well-being, which again people are doing. It's measured by national governments now to try to measure well-being in terms of how people feel about their lives.
POD1000000047_S0000187	So general well-being indices, which are not just health-related or length of life-related, I think have got great potential. But you're not going to be able to get the perfect measure on any of them.
POD1000000047_S0000188	So people are often asked, you know, how would you rate how good your life is going from 1 to 10? Typically they give answers between 6 and 8, at least in the UK.
POD1000000047_S0000189	Maybe we could have a micro happy which would be something as good as moving someone from 6 to 7 or 7 to 8 on this welfare scale.
POD1000000047_S0000190	Yes, exactly. I think that those scales, well actually I find them very revealing when people do mention particular cross cultures, as you said.
POD1000000047_S0000192	Everyone says seven.
POD1000000047_S0000194	Maybe because I like number seven, but it also reflects this idea, why is not bad?
POD1000000047_S0000195	Mustn't grumble.
POD1000000047_S0000197	It could be better, but it must not grumble. It is a slightly British, stoic attitude. I think it is almost predictable what people are going to respond. I find, for example, the age distribution of these responses and how the age distribution varies across cultures
POD1000000047_S0000198	extremely interesting. And the idea of, you know, whether one could move
POD1000000047_S0000200	groups of people on that scale would be very important. When I think of charities, I get to
POD1000000047_S0000201	which are not directly, I don't think, going to actually make people live longer, but you'd hope to, would improve people's well-being and sense of happiness considerably.
POD1000000047_S0000202	Yeah, it is a fascinating area of research and there are significant international differences. So I think in the UK and America and Australia, people do tend to give seven or maybe eight if they're feeling particularly good. But in South America, people are just for some reason more exuberant.
POD1000000047_S0000203	and tend to often give 8s even when they're relatively poor. By contrast in Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia like Japan and China, people tend to give relatively low scores relative to how life seems to be going from the outside.
POD1000000047_S0000204	Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, people in different cultures. I think in Africa they're even lower. People are very...
POD1000000047_S0000206	Yeah, there are some countries where the average is as low as a 4 out of 10, which means maybe half of people are giving less than 4, which is a bit unfortunate.
POD1000000047_S0000207	But again, I mean, these are very culturally, I think, specific. But I think what we want to see is relative changes, relative changes perhaps, you know, compared with
POD1000000047_S0000208	the average in that community that you can't just get everyone up to eight or whatever. I mean there are different very different cultural attitudes to do with I think that are reflected in those questions.
POD1000000047_S0000209	Yeah. So by trying to estimate risks or the size of problems in this quantitative way, do you think we risk being biased against approaches that are harder to quantify?
POD1000000047_S0000210	Yeah, there's always a problem that people start believing that the model, the measure, which is only a very inadequate thing, starts becoming the thing that you are, in fact, then trying to, you know, you focus on.
POD1000000047_S0000211	to the detriment of all others. And there's a real problem with over-metricizing any activity, pretending that you can measure the benefits of everything.
POD1000000047_S0000213	academic world of course is a
POD1000000047_S0000214	real example of that where people start getting obsessed with impact factors and nonsense like that. So there's a real danger with believing these things too much. At the same time,
POD1000000047_S0000215	I think you should have a damn good go at her at trying to do it. Just because something is difficult and cannot be done perfectly doesn't mean that you can't at least have a stab at it. Because you may be
POD1000000047_S0000217	very often
POD1000000047_S0000218	these things you might get really clear rankings, you know, great precision might not be required in order to determine that actually this is not an effective use of resources compared with sedentary.
POD1000000047_S0000220	Yeah, and I think that rather than giving us a perfect answer to all questions, using, you know, models and looking at different factors can, as you say, just help you to identify like clear differences or areas where you need to get more information because you just have no idea how to factor that in or
POD1000000047_S0000221	or something so it can definitely be very useful. Finally, to what extent do you think that the average person can benefit from a better understanding of statistics, learning more statistics, either in their everyday lives or in being more effective as altruists?
POD1000000047_S0000222	And to what extent do you think, I guess relating back to the past question, it could potentially limit us?
POD1000000047_S0000224	Yeah, I think, of course I'd say this, wouldn't I? But I do believe that people would benefit from having a greater idea of stats and measurement and number and quantity
POD1000000047_S0000225	and the frailties of that as well, because the point about understanding statistics is both to understand their strengths and their weaknesses, the two are absolutely hand in hand. And what people tend to do at the moment, who are not confident,
POD1000000047_S0000226	with numbers and how they are constructed because in the end they are always constructed. Someone has chosen what to measure and is that they tend to either accept them as if they're God-given truth and that's the number and that's so vital.
POD1000000047_S0000227	Oh yeah, and that is it. That's what we're looking for. Or reject them out of hand. Oh, you can't put numbers in.
POD1000000047_S0000229	analysis and statistics and this sort of nonsense and that sort of those two extreme views are both equally the opposite.
POD1000000047_S0000231	But if you've got a slightly more nuanced view, you'll realize that statistics and numbers and measurement are incredibly valuable tools, but they're just a tool and they have their frailties and inadequacies. So you both need to be able to work together.
POD1000000047_S0000233	teach and understand the strength and the limitations. And well, I'm involved in a number of educational projects in which we're trying to do just that.
POD1000000047_S0000235	So it's really a matter of trying to assign the appropriate weight to each different kind of evidence or each different piece of evidence that comes your way.
POD1000000047_S0000236	I think, I mean, in the end, what statistics is, is to do with its quantitative evidence. That's what we're talking about. And evidence can be good, bad, or, you know, along a whole scale. It's not a true or false.
POD1000000047_S0000237	It's just evidence and you're trying to weigh up that evidence, which we do all the time in our lives. We do this, but you know our guts tend to be a bit fallible when it comes to weighing up evidence.
POD1000000047_S0000239	influenced by certain salient things that attract our attention. And so actually standing back and trying to be a bit cooler about weighing up evidence I think is a really valuable thing to try to do in all areas of life. It doesn't matter what.
POD1000000047_S0000240	Yeah, absolutely, which is not to say that you should completely discount that gut feeling but often just supplement it with some extra-influential statistics.
POD1000000047_S0000241	I got my guts.
POD1000000047_S0000243	I don't trust him a bit, but I still, you know, go with him.
POD1000000047_S0000244	Yeah, I think that's about all we've got time for now, but thanks so much David. This has been very informative and really interesting.
POD1000000047_S0000245	Okay, thanks very much.
POD1000000047_S0000247	Right, if you'd like to hear more from Professor Spiegelhalter, then you can find his blog, Understanding Uncertainty, online. And he's also often on the radio in the UK, in particular on More or Less on BBC Four.

POD1000000048_S0000004	Thanks for having me.
POD1000000048_S0000005	So first up, maybe just tell us a bit about your background and what questions you're looking into at the moment.
POD1000000048_S0000007	Sure. So I used to work on energy policy when I was living in Washington, DC, and I've gradually moved into AI policy over the past few years because it seems like it was more of a neglected area and could have a very large impact.
POD1000000048_S0000008	So I recently started at the Future of Humanity Institute and I'm also concurrently finishing up my PhD in Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology at Arizona State University.
POD1000000048_S0000009	So in both capacities, I am interested in what sorts of methods would be useful for thinking about AI in a rigorous way, and particularly the uncertainty of possible futures surrounding AI.
POD1000000048_S0000010	And I have a few more specific interests, such as openness and artificial intelligence and the risks related to bad actors.
POD1000000048_S0000011	Okay, so are you trying to predict what's going to happen and when and what sort of effects it will have?
POD1000000048_S0000012	So not necessarily predict per se, but at least understand what's plausible. I think that it's very difficult to predict with any high confidence what's going to happen and when.
POD1000000048_S0000013	but understanding, for example, what sorts of actions people could carry out with AI systems today or in the foreseeable future in different domains like cybersecurity,
POD1000000048_S0000014	and information operations, production of fake news automatically, and autonomous drones and so forth.
POD1000000048_S0000015	I think understanding the security landscape of those sorts of things doesn't necessarily require a very detailed forecast of when exactly something will occur so much as understanding what's technologically possible, given near-term trends.
POD1000000048_S0000017	You don't necessarily have to say this is when this particular accident or malicious behavior will occur, but just that these are the sorts of risks that we need to be prepared for.
POD1000000048_S0000018	Right, right. Does that bring you into contact with organizations that are developing AIs like Google?
POD1000000048_S0000020	Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So those organizations have an interest in making sure that AI is as beneficial as possible.
POD1000000048_S0000022	keenly aware of the fact that they can be misused and that there might be accident risks associated with them.
POD1000000048_S0000023	So, for example, I held a workshop fairly recently on the connection between bad actors and AI and what sorts of bad actors we might be concerned about in this space, and we had some participation from some of those groups.
POD1000000048_S0000024	Right, right. What kinds of bad actors are you thinking of?
POD1000000048_S0000025	I think there, you can look at it from a number of different perspectives. So depending on the domain that you're interested in, you might end up with different sorts of actors.
POD1000000048_S0000026	So in the case of physical harm associated with AI, you might look at autonomous weapons and the weaponization of consumer drones. And in that case, it's something that would be particularly appealing to state actors as well as terrorists.
POD1000000048_S0000027	We're already seeing the weaponization of consumer drones, though without much autonomy, if any, in the case of ISIS overseas.
POD1000000048_S0000028	So there are cases like that where we can foresee that particular groups with when given more advanced capabilities such as higher baseline levels of autonomy and consumer drones
POD1000000048_S0000029	would like, would be able to and would like to carry out damage on a larger scale.
POD1000000048_S0000030	But in other cases, it's less clear. So, for example, there are concerns around mass surveillance, and it's often not totally clear whether one should be more concerned about states or corporations.
POD1000000048_S0000031	depending on what sorts of risk you're concerned about. For example, corporations currently have a lot of data on people and
POD1000000048_S0000032	There's, there have been a lot of concerns raised about the use of AI to make decisions that have critical impacts on people's lives.
POD1000000048_S0000033	such as denying loans and court decisions and so forth that are being informed by often not very transparent algorithms.
POD1000000048_S0000034	So those are some concerns, but there's also a potentially different class of concerns around authoritarian states using AI for oppression.
POD1000000048_S0000035	So it's, I think there's a range of risks, but generally speaking, there's going to be a steady increase in the floor of the skill level as these AI technologies diffuse
POD1000000048_S0000036	That is, there will be more and more capabilities available to people at the bottom of the scale, that is individuals as well as people with more access to computing power and money and data at the higher end.
POD1000000048_S0000037	So it's not totally clear how to think about that because on the one hand you might expect that
POD1000000048_S0000038	The biggest actors are the most concerning because they have the most skill and resources. But on the other hand, they also are sometimes in the case of democratic governments,
POD1000000048_S0000039	held accountable to citizens and in the case of corporations held accountable to stakeholders. You might also think that you would be more concerned about individual rogue actors.
POD1000000048_S0000040	So that's an issue I'm still trying to think through in the context of the report that I'm writing based on that workshop.
POD1000000048_S0000041	Right. So people often distinguish between the short-term risks from AI, like self-driving cars not working properly or algorithmic bias.
POD1000000048_S0000042	and then the longer term concerns of what we're going to do once an artificial intelligence is as smart as humans or potentially much, much more intelligent. Which one of those do you spend more time working on?
POD1000000048_S0000043	I try to focus on issues that span different time horizons. So I think AI and security is something that we're already seeing some early instances of today.
POD1000000048_S0000044	So it's already being used for detection of cyber threats, for example, and the production of vulnerabilities in software. There's a lot of research going on.
POD1000000048_S0000045	with an example being the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge recently, where there was automated hacking and automated defense.
POD1000000048_S0000046	So there's already stuff happening on the front of AI and security as well as the economics of AI and issues surrounding privacy.
POD1000000048_S0000047	But it's not totally clear whether the issues in the future will just be straightforward extensions of those or whether there will be qualitatively different
POD1000000048_S0000049	I think it's important to think about what's happening today and imagine how it might progressively develop into a more extreme future, as well as to think about possible discontinuities when AI progresses more quickly.
POD1000000048_S0000050	Right, right. So I should say at this point that we have a profile up on our website about the potential upsides and downsides of artificial intelligence where we go through all of the basics
POD1000000048_S0000051	And Miles, you have a forthcoming guide to work on AI policy and strategy that we're going to link to. So here we're going to try to go beyond that. So if you find yourself a little bit confused, then potentially just go and read one of those documents first.
POD1000000048_S0000052	So, which policy or strategy questions do you see as most important for us to answer in order to ensure that the development of artificial intelligence goes well rather than in a bad way?
POD1000000048_S0000053	I think there are a lot of questions and some of the ones I was talking about earlier surrounding security and preventing the weaponization of AI by dangerous actors is one.
POD1000000048_S0000054	But one, and there are also other issues that have been widely discussed in the media and by academics such as accountability of algorithms and transparency, the economic impacts of AI, and so forth.
POD1000000048_S0000055	But one that I think is particularly important, particularly over the long term, and this is a case where there might be a need to think about possible discontinuities,
POD1000000048_S0000056	is coordination surrounding AI safety. So there's been a lot of attention called to AI safety in the past few years, and there's starting to be a lot of concrete and successful research on the problem of avoiding certain AI safety failure modes.
POD1000000048_S0000057	like wireheading and value misalignment and so forth. But there's been less attention paid to how do you actually incentivize people to act on the best practices and the good theoretical frameworks that are developed.
POD1000000048_S0000058	assuming that they will be developed. And that's a potentially big problem if there's a competitive situation between companies or between countries or both, and there's an incentive to skimp on those safety measures.
POD1000000048_S0000059	So there's been a little bit of work, for example, by Armstrong et al at the Future of Humanity Institute, looking at arms race type scenarios involving AI where there would be an incentive to skimp.
POD1000000048_S0000060	because you're concerned about losing the lead in an AI race. And there might be significant, we don't really know what the extent will be.
POD1000000048_S0000061	but it might turn out that there are significant trade-offs between safety and performance of AI systems. So one might be tempted to, in order to gain an advantage, whether economic or military or intelligence-wise,
POD1000000048_S0000062	ramp up the capabilities of an AI system by adding more hardware, adding more data, adding more sensors and effectors and so forth. But that might actually be dangerous if you don't understand the full behavioral envelope of the system.
POD1000000048_S0000063	so to speak, and how to constrain actors, the human actors, from doing that is a very difficult problem.
POD1000000048_S0000064	So I've, I along with some others at the Future of Humanity Institute and others at different organizations have started thinking about what is an incentive compatible mechanism to ensure
POD1000000048_S0000065	that people do the right thing in that case. That is to say, we don't want to ask people to do something that's totally against their interests.
POD1000000048_S0000066	if they actually do have an interest in developing these systems and protecting themselves militarily or otherwise. But we also want to ensure that they're constrained in some sort of way.
POD1000000048_S0000067	So one example would be an arranged, this is not necessarily a fully fleshed out example, but just to illustrate the sort of thing I'm talking about.
POD1000000048_S0000068	would be some sort of arrangement between AI developers such that in order to gain access to the latest breakthroughs or the latest computing power,
POD1000000048_S0000069	you would need to submit to some sort of safety monitoring and adhere to certain best practices.
POD1000000048_S0000070	That would create an incentive if you want to be on the cutting edge to participate in those safety protocols. So again, that's not a fully worked out example.
POD1000000048_S0000071	but that's an example of the class of things that I would like to see more of. So developing specific proposals for how to ensure that the right thing that's being developed on the technical front actually gets implemented.
POD1000000048_S0000072	Right. Do you look much at, say, what governments should be doing in this area, whether there's regulations that we should be putting in place or at least preparing to put in place in future?
POD1000000048_S0000073	Yeah, so I think that that ties in with what I was saying a little bit in that one might envision that as AI capabilities develop,
POD1000000048_S0000074	that it will be increasingly seen as a matter of national security that a country be on the leading end. So I think it's not super clear how to navigate that yet.
POD1000000048_S0000075	I think there's some low-hanging fruit. So clearly, in my opinion, it would be beneficial for countries to have some experts in-house in their governments who actually know something about AI.
POD1000000048_S0000076	and are able to deal with crises as they arise, if they arise, and to be able to think carefully about the impacts of AI on the labor force, for example.
POD1000000048_S0000077	So I think there's some low-hanging fruit and some policies that have been developed for dealing with some of the near-term issues. But for the longer-term issues,
POD1000000048_S0000078	It's not super clear that we want to rush into a situation where governments are leading this, if that would turn out to only accentuate the arms race dynamics
POD1000000048_S0000079	that we should be trying to avoid if AI is seen even more as a national security issue in an unhelpful way.
POD1000000048_S0000080	So I think it's incumbent on those who are thinking about the long term policy issues around AI to develop a more positive proposal that involves not just
POD1000000048_S0000081	you know, the US government getting involved for the purpose of accelerating American AI capabilities.
POD1000000048_S0000082	but some more collaborative approach.
POD1000000048_S0000083	I suppose with previous dangerous technologies like nuclear weapons or chemical or biological weapons, there's been agreements to try to slow down their development and deployment. Is that something that could potentially happen here at the international level?
POD1000000048_S0000085	I think it's possible to imagine some sort of slowing down among a small number of actors
POD1000000048_S0000086	And we're fortunate that there is a high concentration of computing power and talent and skill in a fairly small number of organizations.
POD1000000048_S0000087	So there's pretty much no chance of some random person out competing the top organizations at AI in a surprising way.
POD1000000048_S0000088	So it's possible that with some of the top companies and non-profits as well as countries, they could coordinate in some sort of way.
POD1000000048_S0000089	not to postpone AI across society for a long period of time, but at least to be cautious in the later stages of development and to allow time for mutual vetting of safety procedures and things like that.
POD1000000048_S0000090	So I think it's possible to imagine some sort of coordination, but the technical and the political factors interact to a large extent.
POD1000000048_S0000091	to the extent that we actually have good safety measures that are efficient and that don't introduce a lot of overhead, computational or otherwise, into these systems.
POD1000000048_S0000092	then we'll be in a better place to actually get people to coordinate because it won't be imposing a lot of costs on them. And likewise, to the extent that we're able to coordinate better,
POD1000000048_S0000093	it will be in a better position to actually get people to implement those mechanisms if they do impose some performance penalty.
POD1000000048_S0000094	Right. So can you think of any major bits of progress we've made on AI strategy questions over the last couple of years?
POD1000000048_S0000095	So the example I mentioned of the paper by Armstrong et al. called the Race into the Precipice is one example and it presented sort of a stark version of the arms race scenario.
POD1000000048_S0000096	though I think there are reasons to be more optimistic than are presented in that paper, because they look at only a certain set of assumptions as with any model.
POD1000000048_S0000097	But more generally, I think there's been progress in the development of principles and criteria for good policies in recent years. So, for example, with the Asilomar conference and a set of Asilomar AI principles,
POD1000000048_S0000098	I think that was a good step towards developing some shared understanding around the need to avoid arms races and concerns over AI weaponization and so forth.
POD1000000048_S0000099	But it's, I still think that there's a lot of room for
POD1000000048_S0000100	progress to be made. So there was a paper put out by the Future of Humanity Institute by Nick Bostrom, Kirk Flynn, and Alan Defoe recently that looks at policy desiderata for the development of machine superintelligence.
POD1000000048_S0000101	And there's a lot of good material there, but I think they would be the first to admit that we're still at the high-level principle stage of developing these policies.
POD1000000048_S0000102	So we have a better understanding of what we want to avoid than we did a few years ago and what sorts of, what a good policy proposal would look like.
POD1000000048_S0000103	but we don't yet have anything super actionable. So I think the situation is a bit analogous to where AI safety was a few years ago.
POD1000000048_S0000104	where there was starting to be an articulation of what the problem was with the book Superintelligence and various other publications.
POD1000000048_S0000105	And people were starting to take the problem seriously and started to have a vocabulary for what a solution would look like with value alignment and other terms being coined.
POD1000000048_S0000106	But there wasn't yet any concrete research agenda and subsequently there have been a lot of concrete research agendas as well.
POD1000000048_S0000107	well as technical progress on some parts of those research agendas with work by OpenAI and DeepMind and others leading the way.
POD1000000048_S0000108	So I think that we're potentially in a similarly exciting phase on the AI policy front where we have a decent understanding of what the problem is. And with the example of avoiding arms races being forefront in my mind,
POD1000000048_S0000109	least, but we don't yet have a concrete, we don't have clear models and case studies that we can point to as ways forward.
POD1000000048_S0000110	So I think that's the next step is moving into more concrete proposals and trying to balance some of the trade-offs that have been identified in recent papers.
POD1000000048_S0000112	So it seems like a lot of the latest thinking in this area isn't written up in public yet, partly because people don't want to publicize their views at this point or just because it takes a long time to get papers published.
POD1000000048_S0000113	What do you think is the best way for someone who's interested in working in the area to get up to speed on the issues?
POD1000000048_S0000114	So I think, again, it's somewhat analogous to the situation with AI safety a few years ago. And I think the book Superintelligence was a big step forward on that front in terms of having a single reference to point people to.
POD1000000048_S0000115	But it's less clear if there's one single reference point people to on AI policy issues, though I'm hoping that the career guide that I'm working on will be somewhat useful in that regard.
POD1000000048_S0000116	Another resource that comes to mind is a syllabus for a class on the global politics of AI developed by Alan Defoe at Yale and the Future of Humanity Institute.
POD1000000048_S0000117	So that's a very detailed list of resources. And I'm sure there'll be a link provided for this interview somewhere.
POD1000000048_S0000118	Yeah.
POD1000000048_S0000119	And yeah, so I think that's another set of resources. So it's essentially a long list of both formal academic publications as well as things in the more gray literature.
POD1000000048_S0000120	such as blog posts, which is, you know, I think the sort of thing you're referring to is, you know, things that aren't necessarily written up academically, but are, you know, somewhat accessible. But even there, there's still some things like, you know, Google Docs that are used internally and so forth.
POD1000000048_S0000121	So I think if, if, if based on reading those sorts of things, this is clearly something you're interested in, then the obvious next step is just to get in touch with people who are working on these issues and ask and, you know, indicate what your interests are.
POD1000000048_S0000122	there might be things that aren't available online that they can point you to.
POD1000000048_S0000123	Yeah, you mentioned the Asilomar Statement of Principles, do you just want to describe that?
POD1000000048_S0000124	Sure.
POD1000000048_S0000125	Two years ago, there was a conference on beneficial AI held in Puerto Rico, and that led to an open letter on AI.
POD1000000048_S0000126	and subsequently some investment by Elon Musk in the Future of Life Institute, which supported a lot of grants in this space.
POD1000000048_S0000127	And I think that that led to a lot of attention to the issue and there were thousands of people, including a lot of scientists who signed on to that letter.
POD1000000048_S0000128	And then subsequently the Asilomar AI principles, which were developed at a conference two years later this year at Asilomar in California.
POD1000000048_S0000129	developed a more specific set of proposals for what sorts of things AI scientists should be thinking about. So not just the fact that there should be more research, but also things like capability cautions.
POD1000000048_S0000130	So being attentive to the fact that we don't know for sure what the upper limits of AI capabilities will ultimately be.
POD1000000048_S0000131	and the things I mentioned about avoiding arms races and being concerned about AI weaponization more broadly. So I think that's a good example of developing, you know, sort of a consensus view on what
POD1000000048_S0000132	What we want to see and what we don't want to see we want to see benefiting society as a whole and we don't want to see it leading to the occurring of benefits to a small number of people or to large scale war or anything like that.
POD1000000048_S0000133	And I think it's encouraging to see not just that, but also the development of other sets of principles through the IEEE and their effort on ethically aligned AI design.
POD1000000048_S0000134	So I read those principles and they seemed quite strong on paper. Do you think people are likely to follow through on them?
POD1000000048_S0000135	I think there's somewhat of a gap between the level of abstraction of the principles and concrete steps that people can take.
POD1000000048_S0000136	So, for example, it's not totally clear what any individual can can do to stop an arms race, for example, but I think it's a step in the right direction to know where where you're headed at
POD1000000048_S0000137	And then figuring out exactly what to do about that is the next step.
POD1000000048_S0000138	So in your guide, you suggest that people could potentially work on AI strategy and policy questions at places like Google DeepMind or OpenAI where artificial intelligence is actually being developed.
POD1000000048_S0000139	What concretely could you see people doing at places like that if they took a job there?
POD1000000048_S0000140	Yeah, so to some extent, people at those organizations are doing something fairly similar to what I and my colleagues are doing in academia, which is
POD1000000048_S0000141	which is thinking about what the problems are and trying to develop solutions. I think the benefit of being on that side of things is to have more direct exposure to what's happening on the ground, so to speak.
POD1000000048_S0000142	in AI development, and I think that can be useful for developing a set of what sorts of problems are actually cropping up as a result of the development of capabilities that actually exist as opposed to just ones in the future.
POD1000000048_S0000143	Though I think it's also notable that people at these organizations have been very active in the efforts that I've mentioned, such as raising attention to AI safety,
POD1000000048_S0000144	which was an initiative that involved people at Google Brain and OpenAI and the concrete problems and AI safety paper.
POD1000000048_S0000145	And people at DeepMind have been very influential in calling for more AI safety work, and they've been publishing fairly early on this matter relative to other organizations.
POD1000000048_S0000146	So I think there's a lot of reason to think that these organizations are playing a positive role and I think it's, it would be a good place to be involved in sort of thought, thought leadership on these topics.
POD1000000048_S0000147	as well as doing direct research.
POD1000000048_S0000149	And how hard is it to get a job at a place like that?
POD1000000048_S0000151	I would imagine they would only have a few people working on AI strategy or policy. Are these extremely competitive roles?
POD1000000048_S0000152	I would say they're pretty competitive. And I think that's a general phenomenon in anything related to AI these days, whether on the policy side or the technical side.
POD1000000048_S0000153	But I think that this is a growth area for sure. So if one develops expertise in this topic and has something to contribute to it,
POD1000000048_S0000154	then I think there will ultimately be opportunities available to you in the next few years.
POD1000000048_S0000155	It's again I want to draw an analogy to AI safety where there was a lot of concern about, you know, will there be jobs and AI safety, you know, three years or so ago and I think that deterred some grad students from working in this space.
POD1000000048_S0000156	And now the situation seems to look a bit better in that there's a fair number of advertisements for postdocs and people being hired at top labs to work on these issues.
POD1000000048_S0000157	So I think we'll probably see something pretty similar, not necessarily it becoming not competitive, but there being a little bit of slackening over time as there's a need for developing larger teams to work on these topics.
POD1000000048_S0000159	And another path you've talked about is going into politics or policy roles, for example as a congressional staffer or perhaps at a think tank like the Brookings Institute or the National Science Foundation or potentially just going into party politics in general.
POD1000000048_S0000160	What useful things do you envisage people could do there?
POD1000000048_S0000162	Yes, so I think in the same way that working at an AI lab would give you a better sense of what's practical on the technical front,
POD1000000048_S0000163	working for Congress or Parliament or a political party would give you a better sense of what's practical on the political front.
POD1000000048_S0000164	So in addition to that, developing a better intuition for the system that you're dealing with and what the constraints are.
POD1000000048_S0000165	I think it's also potentially a good way to actually influence what's actually done by those bodies.
POD1000000048_S0000166	So for example, in the US Congress right now, there was just recently announced an AI caucus to organize the discussion of members of Congress on issues related to AI.
POD1000000048_S0000167	with particular focus on issues related to the future of work, but I think over time we'll see more discussion of the longer term sorts of issues.
POD1000000048_S0000168	That we've been talking about in in those four and it would be useful to have people who are concerned about making sure that the right thing is is ultimately done working in those places.
POD1000000048_S0000169	able to actually act on the best current understanding developed by researchers and by practitioners.
POD1000000048_S0000170	Yeah. So I think a big risk of going into politics or policy in general would be that your career progresses but you're not specifically in one of the places that ends up having a say in how these things go.
POD1000000048_S0000171	You just end up being, working in a congressional committee that turns out not to be that relevant. Are there any roles that you can take early on or what can you do to position yourself well so that you don't just get sidelined in the end?
POD1000000048_S0000173	I think if you intend to work in politics, then you have to be somewhat opportunistic about jobs and the ebb and flow of political opportunities. So, for example,
POD1000000048_S0000174	If one congressional committee is declining in its relevance in terms of AI, then one should consider about jumping ship towards somewhere that's more relevant.
POD1000000048_S0000175	So I don't think that taking one particular job will lock you in forever, but building up some political capital and some human capital in that area could be useful.
POD1000000048_S0000176	Even if you ultimately want to switch to a different organization, but I would push back a little bit on the idea of, you know, not not being relevant just because you're not at the on the side of people.
POD1000000048_S0000177	You're not at the organization where people are developing the latest AI. I mean, as I mentioned before, I think that's a very exciting opportunity. And along with academia, it's a great place to work on these issues.
POD1000000048_S0000178	But governments still play an important role in framing these issues and in convening discussions.
POD1000000048_S0000179	So an example of this would be the Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence report put out by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy last year.
POD1000000048_S0000180	which was the result of four workshops that brought together experts in a wide variety of areas in law, economics, AI technology, and safety.
POD1000000048_S0000181	And so I think you still have an opportunity to frame the discussion and move the ball forward, even if you're not working in the latest labs.
POD1000000048_S0000182	Yeah. So what would be some of the best places to apply to in that area?
POD1000000048_S0000183	So it's a bit tricky to answer that in general. It depends on factors like what your citizenship is and what particular policy issues you're interested in.
POD1000000048_S0000184	But some fairly robust recommendations would be to look for a particular class of people that have technical backgrounds.
POD1000000048_S0000185	One area to look at would be AAAS fellowships. So the American Association for the Advancement of Science has a fellowship program
POD1000000048_S0000186	where they essentially put people in rotations in organizations like Congress and the executive branch where they can implement some of some of they can, you know, draw on their technical experience.
POD1000000048_S0000187	and someone with a background in AI would probably end up in an AI relevant organization. So I've heard a lot of good things about that being a good way to develop career capital and experience and understanding of how the political system works.
POD1000000048_S0000188	But that's not necessarily going to result in being in the exact right location for solving AI policy problems the next few months.
POD1000000048_S0000189	I think it's really hard to say where that would be, or even if there is such a place, because I think we're still
POD1000000048_S0000190	despite all the progress that's being made in a relatively early stage. So there isn't even yet a nomination for the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the White House
POD1000000048_S0000191	So, otherwise, I would say that that is a good place to go. So, and likewise, we don't really know what the agenda of the Trump administration is on the AI front.
POD1000000048_S0000192	And there's a lot of discussion, but not much institution building in governments at the moment. So it's hard for me to answer that in general.
POD1000000048_S0000193	but I think getting experience is a pretty robust thing to do.
POD1000000048_S0000194	Right. So a situation that I encounter reasonably often is I meet someone who's really smart, who is very interested in this topic, who might be able to make a great contribution.
POD1000000048_S0000195	But at the moment, there aren't that many groups that are hiring for these roles. So, you're at the Future of Humanity Institute and I guess there's also the Future of Life Institute. But there aren't that many places that someone can potentially apply.
POD1000000048_S0000196	So I'm thinking what advice should I give someone in that situation? Should they continue studying perhaps or building expertise so that they're in a better position to apply in future when the number of positions grows?
POD1000000048_S0000197	Yeah, I mean, again, it's hard to answer that in general. It depends on what
POD1000000048_S0000198	background the person has and what sorts of jobs are interested in. But I think if one casts a fairly large net in terms of what AI issues one wants to work on, there's a fairly large range of organizations.
POD1000000048_S0000199	It's not just FHI, there's also the Center for the Study of Existential Risk, the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence, the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington.
POD1000000048_S0000200	And, you know, various faculty programs around the various academic programs around the country in the US and around the world are looking to hire people.
POD1000000048_S0000201	for example, as postdocs or a faculty member in areas related to AI and policy if you're someone with an academic background.
POD1000000048_S0000202	and there are probably a fair number of policy positions at tech companies that aren't necessarily specific to AI, but that would lead to getting valuable experience in the broad area of tech policies.
POD1000000048_S0000203	So again, one, I guess to generalize a bit, I would recommend casting a fairly large net and working in adjacent areas if you can't immediately work in the exact right place.
POD1000000048_S0000204	Because this is not the sort of area where people have been working on AI policy for decades and it's hard to break in for that reason. It's more just that it's still a field that's growing.
POD1000000048_S0000205	And I don't think that that growth will stop. So I think there will be more opportunities in the future. But if you can't find the right opportunity now,
POD1000000048_S0000206	then again, talk to people in the field about what sorts of opportunities are on the horizon and try and work in adjacent fields. That might be one thing to consider.
POD1000000048_S0000207	Yeah, so what do you think would be the biggest challenges for someone sitting out trying to start a career in this area?
POD1000000048_S0000208	Depending on one's background, I think the main challenge would be boning up on areas of weakness.
POD1000000048_S0000209	So for example, if you have a policy background, you might want to focus on learning more about AI. And if you have a technical background, you might want to focus more on learning about policy.
POD1000000048_S0000210	I think one of the challenges is what you mentioned before about there not being a super clearly accessible literature on the topic.
POD1000000048_S0000211	And I think there's some effort being going into addressing that with a career guide and the bibliography that I mentioned.
POD1000000048_S0000212	But I'm not really sure that there's any specific set of pitfalls that I would recommend that people take away from this.
POD1000000048_S0000213	people avoid besides not neglecting the areas in which they're weak. And don't try and rest on your laurels in, say, technical areas or policy areas, because it's a fairly interdisciplinary area.
POD1000000048_S0000214	and you would need to think about what sorts of disciplinary perspectives would be beneficial to solving the problem you're interested in and not just what is your background, though of course you wanna draw on your strengths.
POD1000000048_S0000215	I guess because it's a field that's at its fairly early stages and is growing quickly.
POD1000000048_S0000216	It would be a good fit for someone who was really able to set their own direction and meet people and potentially attract funding to do what they want to do. Someone who's going to create the opportunities that they want to go into.
POD1000000048_S0000217	Yeah, absolutely. And I, yeah, it's an area that's evolving and I think a lot of the organizations
POD1000000048_S0000218	that exist today, and I have mentioned as, as you know, good, good places to work and so forth, didn't exist five years ago. So,
POD1000000048_S0000220	Yeah, some of them didn't exist one year ago. So it's it's an area in flux. And I think, you know, as with politics,
POD1000000048_S0000221	You should be opportunistic about thinking about what's the right place for you to be in.
POD1000000048_S0000222	But yeah, I think it's a very exciting area to work in and I think that a lot of people will find that it's an area that would benefit from their background.
POD1000000048_S0000223	So if you had someone who could go into any kind of organizational role and that'd be a good fit for it, what kind of person would you think is most valuable out of everything?
POD1000000048_S0000225	Most valuable person? I don't really have an answer for that.
POD1000000048_S0000226	I didn't have an answer to that.
POD1000000048_S0000227	Yeah.
POD1000000048_S0000228	Is there any say vacancy out there that you think, you know, you just wish that someone could fill it?
POD1000000048_S0000229	Um...
POD1000000048_S0000231	I mean, one vacancy that comes to mind is for the policy researcher position at DeepMind. So they're currently hiring for someone to specifically look at AI policy.
POD1000000048_S0000232	So I think the case is pretty clear that that would be a good place to work and a good role to have if you're interested in influencing the conversation around AI policy and being exposed to the latest developments.
POD1000000048_S0000233	So, yeah, if you'd be a good candidate for that and you're interested in that, you should definitely apply.
POD1000000048_S0000234	So sometimes I find people who want to work on AI policy because they don't see themselves as quite cut out for technical research, perhaps because their math skills aren't quite good enough.
POD1000000048_S0000235	Is that a sensible way to go or is in some ways the AI strategy work harder just because it's less clear, it's less precise than technical work?
POD1000000048_S0000236	I wouldn't say it's harder or easier, it's just different. But even on the technical side, there's a lot of fuzziness.
POD1000000048_S0000237	So, you know, AI safety wasn't very crisply defined a few years ago, and it's starting to move more in the direction of technical rigor.
POD1000000048_S0000238	And I think the same thing will happen to AI policy to some extent, but there will also always be some element of relationship building and qualitative analysis and so forth.
POD1000000048_S0000239	that certainly is not exactly the same as solving technical problems. So yes, I do think that having a different background, it would make sense to choose different areas to work based on your background.
POD1000000048_S0000240	But I wouldn't say that, you know, working on the safety problem is totally technical and the policy problem is totally non-technical. But certainly there's some correlation there.
POD1000000048_S0000241	And what kind of level of technical understanding do you have to get to in order to be able to make a useful contribution?
POD1000000048_S0000242	I'm not sure that you need any specific level in order to make some contribution. So, for example, there are a lot of roles that could be played by people who are just good at distilling the literature on a particular topic.
POD1000000048_S0000243	So for example, if we're interested in understanding the role that AI could play in authoritarian states,
POD1000000048_S0000244	then you don't necessarily have to have any technical background to read up on the literature around surveillance and coercion and things like that.
POD1000000048_S0000245	So I think there's a lot of room for just good synthesizers and people who are curious and interested to dip into areas they're unfamiliar with.
POD1000000048_S0000246	But I think there's also a fairly high ceiling for what would be useful.
POD1000000048_S0000247	So I think it would also be good to have people with very strong technical backgrounds thinking about the, you know, the nitty gritty game theory issues related to arms races and so forth.
POD1000000048_S0000248	So I think it's a pretty broad range of possible skill sets that would be useful.
POD1000000048_S0000249	Right. So you're thinking if you can just understand what, you can speculate about what an AI might be capable of doing in the future. And then say if you know economics or if you know social science,
POD1000000048_S0000250	and you can think, well, what implications would that have for politics and that kind of thing, even if you don't understand specifically how the AI would work.
POD1000000048_S0000251	Yeah, I mean, ideally, you'd know a little bit about about each of those things, but you don't need to be an expert in everything. It's impossible to be an expert in everything.
POD1000000048_S0000252	So you, it's not feasible to learn about every single discipline of which all the several in this policy career guide that you mentioned.
POD1000000048_S0000253	Clearly, you cannot be an expert, a deep expert in technical AI, economics, sociology, political science, etc.
POD1000000048_S0000254	But knowing a little bit and being able to collaborate with people with complementary skill sets is also very valuable.
POD1000000048_S0000255	So I think a lot of the most exciting work in the next few years will involve collaboration between people on the technical side and on the policy side.
POD1000000048_S0000256	Right, so how can someone tell which kind of paths they're most suited for?
POD1000000048_S0000258	I don't think that there's any clear algorithm for this, but talking to people in the area and reading some of the literature and thinking about where you think the gaps are,
POD1000000048_S0000259	what areas you think that you could shed light on, given your background is definitely something you should do.
POD1000000048_S0000260	You should look at what sorts of job opportunities are available and cast a fairly broad net because you don't necessarily know what's going to strike your interest until you stumble upon that opportunity.
POD1000000048_S0000261	And networking is also super helpful. So I think, you know, not just in terms of finding out about job opportunities and figuring out where there's a nice fit, but also finding out about different organizational cultures and where you might fit in is also useful.
POD1000000048_S0000262	So yeah, I don't think there's a single algorithm, but networking and reading more of the literature and looking at job postings are all good things to do.
POD1000000048_S0000263	Yeah, what kinds of places can people network? Are there any events that are open to people who don't yet have roles?
POD1000000048_S0000264	Yeah, so all of the AI conferences are open to anyone who is capable of paying for the trip and the ticket.
POD1000000048_S0000265	So some examples of big AI conferences are NIPS, ICML,
POD1000000048_S0000267	AAAI and so forth.
POD1000000048_S0000268	NIPS is probably the biggest machine learning conference right now with an emphasis on deep learning. ICML is also a very large one. Actually, I'm not sure which one of those is bigger.
POD1000000048_S0000269	I haven't been to ICML, but I've been to NIPS a few times. And iClear, ICLR, is also a deep learning specific conference.
POD1000000048_S0000270	So I think going to conferences like that and specifically going to workshops and symposia that are relevant to policy questions, which often happens at these conferences,
POD1000000048_S0000271	So for example, at NIPS last year, there was a symposium on AI and the law.
POD1000000048_S0000272	There are opportunities like that to network and find out more about how people in that area are thinking and to meet people who have similar interests.
POD1000000048_S0000273	And that's just on the AI side. It's also worth thinking about more policy-oriented conferences. So there's some conferences like the Governance of Emerging Technologies conference.
POD1000000048_S0000274	The We Robot conference series, and probably a few others that would be of interest to people who are either on the technical side, want to move into more thinking about policy side,
POD1000000048_S0000275	or just they're in the policy side, but they want to specifically seek out people interested in AI, those would be good places to look.
POD1000000048_S0000276	Are any of the organizations involved open enough that someone who's interested in the area can drop by and get to know people?
POD1000000048_S0000277	Yeah, so I think, particularly on the academic side, though, you know, to some extent, also at corporations, there's a fair amount of openness.
POD1000000048_S0000278	And, you know, for example, at FHI, we host a lot of visitors who just want to learn more about our work. And the same is true of other organizations.
POD1000000048_S0000280	Yeah. So, it sounded like in your guide, you thought that the best undergraduate major was something like combining a technical subject
POD1000000048_S0000281	like maths or computer science with more social science topic like politics or economics.
POD1000000048_S0000282	Assuming that most people listening to this have already chosen their major, what should people do at the postgraduate level? Should they do a PhD or just go and work directly at Google if they can?
POD1000000048_S0000284	I...
POD1000000048_S0000286	I mean, I've probably said this a million times, but I don't think there's a clear answer for everyone.
POD1000000048_S0000288	But certainly, you know, it doesn't hurt to have an advanced degree. Of course, there are opportunity costs, but there are certainly more job opportunities available for someone who has a PhD.
POD1000000048_S0000289	So, for example, I don't know if it's a hard requirement, certainly, but certainly it would be a benefit for people applying to a fair number of industry jobs if they had an advanced degree.
POD1000000048_S0000290	As well as an academia so I mean it's hard to avoid the fact that you know for academic jobs as much as. You know, we would like to, you know, hire people solely based on you know their demonstrated skill it's.
POD1000000048_S0000291	often also the case that their university policies surrounding you know what sorts of degrees you need for for different roles and pay grades and so forth. So
POD1000000048_S0000292	There's definitely value to having a graduate degree, despite the non-trivial opportunity costs if you have an opportunity.
POD1000000048_S0000293	But, you know, as with all of these things, it depends on someone's background and if you have a clear opportunity to make an impact.
POD1000000048_S0000294	And you could, you know, perhaps get some of the best of both worlds by, you know, also taking classes online or enrolling at a local university and being a part time PhD student or master's student, I think.
POD1000000048_S0000295	There might be ways to have your cake and eat it too, but it would depend on the particular person.
POD1000000048_S0000296	Yeah, and I guess the most obvious options at the postgraduate level are things like machine learning or computer science or economics or I guess public policy, is that useful?
POD1000000048_S0000297	Yeah, so, at, you know, just to give a particular example, at Oxford, we have a handful of people who are interested in AI safety and AI policy, as well as broader issues related to the future.
POD1000000048_S0000298	And, you know, just at the organization that I'm at, FHI, there are people who are either currently enrolled or will soon be enrolled in programs in mine, which is Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology.
POD1000000048_S0000299	as well as machine learning, cyber security, and zoology. So there's a wide range of possible areas that one could study and find an advisor that is suitable and interested in supporting interesting work.
POD1000000048_S0000301	Yeah. So, some people worry that doing work in this area could be harmful if not done well. For example, it could be that, as you were saying earlier, that regulation in this area could be done poorly and would actually be harmful overall.
POD1000000048_S0000302	or that bringing greater attention to the issue could reinforce the arms race dynamic. Alternatively, having people get involved who don't have enough technical expertise could bring the area into disrepute.
POD1000000048_S0000303	How seriously do you take those kinds of concerns? Should people be cautious about jumping into the area if they don't feel like they're really on top of things?
POD1000000048_S0000304	Um, I.
POD1000000048_S0000306	I think that it's a reasonable concern. And, you know, there is in fact
POD1000000048_S0000307	some some risk of discrediting yourself or or your cause by by being, you know, to to alarmist or whatever the particular charge might be.
POD1000000048_S0000308	But on the other hand, there's a lot of noise in the system, no matter what. And whatever you do in the near term, there will be Terminator pictures and people who dismiss AI safety and all sorts of other things you can't really control.
POD1000000048_S0000309	So I think there are also risks of not acting, which is not being able to help out when there's an important problem and you have something to contribute.
POD1000000048_S0000310	So I would say, if that's something that concerns you, then talk to people about your beliefs and what their beliefs are.
POD1000000048_S0000311	whether there's, you know, how and look at surveys of experts and, you know, see, see how, you know, what what what the, you know, reasonable distribution is among people who have studied the topic more.
POD1000000048_S0000312	So I don't think it's an all or nothing sort of thing where you either have to stay ignorant or be a super expert.
POD1000000048_S0000313	But I think there's a middle ground where you sort of develop your confidence little by little as you go and try and remain as modest as possible in areas that you have little expertise.
POD1000000048_S0000314	Yeah, I suppose you can always just track the things that people like you or Nick Bostrom are saying and how you speak about the issue so that you don't come across as alarmist and you have a measured and precise tone.
POD1000000048_S0000315	Right.
POD1000000048_S0000316	Yeah. So you mentioned earlier that AI could potentially be used in military applications, and that's one way that things could go badly. Given that, do you see much value in people going into military or intelligence roles with the hope of limiting this in the future?
POD1000000048_S0000318	Possibly. It's really hard to say. It would depend on the particular role. So probably a role higher up in the chain and more on the policy and strategy sides of things.
POD1000000048_S0000319	as opposed to the more operational or logistical or just execution side of things, would be more likely to give you an opportunity to affect those sorts of things.
POD1000000048_S0000320	But there might also be benefits to that beyond just having a direct impact on the issue while in that role.
POD1000000048_S0000321	You can also develop valuable connections and know the right people to influence from the outside down the road or have a better understanding of the dynamics of the problem and what needs to be done to solve it.
POD1000000048_S0000322	I definitely wouldn't dismiss it, but I also wouldn't necessarily recommend it across the board as the best thing to do.
POD1000000048_S0000323	Yeah. I guess the intelligence services and the military are just such enormous bureaucracies. I suppose I'd worry that someone, like it's just unlikely perhaps that you'd be in the right place at the right time or have enough discretion in those roles to be able to make a difference.
POD1000000048_S0000324	But as you say, it could help you to build up your career capital so you can get other good useful roles in future. And you know how the system works so you can potentially influence it from outside and talk to the right people.
POD1000000048_S0000325	Yeah, exactly. So, you know, again, it would depend on the particular person and what other options they have, but it's certainly worth considering.
POD1000000048_S0000326	What about foreign policy? Could it be useful to go into the Department of State or something like that and work on arms control agreements?
POD1000000048_S0000327	or even just current arms control agreements so that you understand how they work and can think about how they might work for AI in future.
POD1000000048_S0000329	Yeah, so I think that could be very useful. Looking at arms control and foreign policy, you know, both from an academic perspective and from a practitioner perspective, I think it's very valuable.
POD1000000048_S0000330	And it's something that we're not, that's not our strong suit in the AI safety and policy community right now.
POD1000000048_S0000331	So more could be done on that front, but I think some of the same caveats apply to the – as to the military and intelligence side of things that the State Department, for example, is a very large bureaucracy.
POD1000000048_S0000332	Yeah. And how do you feel about just more general attempts to make the world better such that when AI is developed, things are more likely to go well?
POD1000000048_S0000333	For example, just improving the quality of government in general, trying to get the right kinds of people elected or improving our ability to forecast the future across the board.
POD1000000048_S0000335	I guess one worry would be that that's just not sufficiently leveraged on this specific problem. And if you think AI is really likely to be the key issue, then you want to work on that specifically.
POD1000000048_S0000336	But maybe if you can improve our ability to forecast technological changes in future across the board, then that could be a better option. And also, you just have a lot more options if you're open to broader ways of improving the world.
POD1000000048_S0000337	Yeah, I don't think there's a clear decision for everyone, but both at the group level and at the individual level, it often makes sense to take a somewhat of a portfolio approach.
POD1000000048_S0000338	So there are people at FHI who are also affiliated with the Center for Effective Altruism and involved in building the EA community like Owen Cotton Barrett and Toby Ord.
POD1000000048_S0000339	So there are people who straddle that boundary and look for opportunities to benefit both sides. And there are also people who focus on one thing or the other.
POD1000000048_S0000340	So I don't think there's a clear right answer, but certainly the sorts of trade-offs you mentioned sound reasonable. Like on the one hand, one would want the world to be in a better place.
POD1000000048_S0000341	there to be more people who are thinking carefully about making good decisions and benefiting the future people in various important decision-making roles.
POD1000000048_S0000342	But it's quite uncertain what impact you could have on AI. And likewise, even if you work directly on AI, it's not totally clear that that's always the best thing you should do.
POD1000000048_S0000343	But I have a slight bias toward thinking that direct work needs more attention at the moment. But I think that you should take that with a grain of salt.
POD1000000048_S0000344	because I would like more people to help solve the specific problems I'm working on.
POD1000000048_S0000345	So we should potentially continue trying to get people involved. Should it all just become AI researchers right away?
POD1000000048_S0000346	Right.
POD1000000048_S0000347	So that's all of my questions. Was there anything you wanted to add?
POD1000000048_S0000348	Any inspiring message?
POD1000000048_S0000349	Yeah, I mean, I'll just sort of circle back on what I was saying earlier, which is that AI safety was in a very nebulous stage of development a few years ago.
POD1000000048_S0000350	And it took the work of Nick Bostrom and superintelligence and Stuart Russell and giving a lot of talks and writing op-eds to call more attention to it and give it more legitimacy.
POD1000000048_S0000351	And then subsequent work was done to refine the issue and develop research agendas by people, including the authors of the concrete problems and AI safety paper.
POD1000000048_S0000352	And now we have a lot of postdocs and graduate students working specifically on this. We have people in industry specifically working on well-defined problems in this space.
POD1000000048_S0000353	And we have the opportunity to make a similar transition in AI policy over the next few years.
POD1000000048_S0000354	were removed from fairly high-level desiderata and problem framings to specific proposals and formal models and good white papers.
POD1000000048_S0000355	and so forth over the next few years. And it's an area that would benefit from a lot of people's expertise. So I would definitely encourage people to who think they might have some relevant expertise to seriously consider it.
POD1000000048_S0000356	Yeah, I'll just reiterate that since I wrote our problem profile on positively shaping artificial development, we've heard from a lot of people who think that this is the most neglected area within AI safety.
POD1000000048_S0000357	and I'm very keen to get more people working on these problems and getting more organizations hiring for them. So if it's something that you're interested in,
POD1000000048_S0000358	I think you should definitely be looking into it more and we'll put up links to guides where you can find out more and meet the right people.
POD1000000048_S0000360	Yeah, thanks so much. Have a great day and look forward to talking in future.
POD1000000048_S0000361	All right, thanks. Bye.
YOU1000000000_S0000000	On this week's episode, we drive the new Ford Ranger. We answer questions about EVs and driving in cold weather.
YOU1000000000_S0000001	and also answer the question, what do we do with the cars once we're done testing them? Next on Talking Cars.
YOU1000000000_S0000003	Hi, and welcome back. I'm Mike Quincy.
YOU1000000000_S0000005	So we like to give a little behind the scenes look at what goes on here at Consumer Reports Auto Test Track.
YOU1000000000_S0000006	We talk to people who are diehard enthusiasts as well as people that look upon cars as merely appliances.
YOU1000000000_S0000007	And we find that they're absolutely shocked when they find out that we buy every test car.
YOU1000000000_S0000008	that we put through our test program and that for testing purposes we drive a different car every night.
YOU1000000000_S0000009	So, to take us through the process, Ryan, how do you decide what do you drive every night?
YOU1000000000_S0000010	Well, before that, you know the routine. We buy all these cars anonymously.
YOU1000000000_S0000011	We bring them back here, we check them in. We have a wall of keys and it's like a fantasy land, right?
YOU1000000000_S0000012	And we get to pick these cars every night, almost every single night we drive a different car. That's pretty ridiculous, right?
YOU1000000000_S0000013	So there's the wall keys, we pick what we're going to drive.
YOU1000000000_S0000014	And some of these cars, if it's a brand new car, it has a priority. We have to get it up to miles. We have to get it up to 2,000 miles before we can test it.
YOU1000000000_S0000015	And there's people that are writing first drives, or the engineers, people that have a direct influence on the early testing.
YOU1000000000_S0000016	have to get in these cars first.
YOU1000000000_S0000017	Video producers that get on us for doing a first-ride video
YOU1000000000_S0000018	always bothering us to do more work.
YOU1000000000_S0000019	So there's some sort of a, I don't want to call it a pecking order, but
YOU1000000000_S0000020	But there's priorities. People need to get in these cars. And we all understand that.
YOU1000000000_S0000021	and make way for that. And once they're done testing them,
YOU1000000000_S0000022	They go to another wall and that wall that's the huge wall. Yeah, this wall has is all like the retirees, right?
YOU1000000000_S0000024	will be a liberal but this is a very good and this is a very good interesting
YOU1000000000_S0000025	Because the first keyboard is cars that they have to all get miles. We're driving them irregardless. When they move to the other board, now it's selective.
YOU1000000000_S0000026	And that's when you get to see the favorites.
YOU1000000000_S0000027	Right. Yeah, you get to see the cars that people really actually like and the cars that after testing people are like, eh.
YOU1000000000_S0000028	No, I'm not going to drive that anymore.
YOU1000000000_S0000029	Yeah, so it's kind of interesting because some of these cars, it's winter, auto start.
YOU1000000000_S0000030	Heated seats. Clear winners. SUVs. I mean, I go up to Vermont and do stuff. I always have an SUV.
YOU1000000000_S0000031	something with all-wheel drive.
YOU1000000000_S0000032	Yeah, or you're into boats, you got trailers to tow and stuff like that.
YOU1000000000_S0000033	That brings us around to the springtime, which we're hoping for, that it comes anytime soon.
YOU1000000000_S0000034	But the most frequently asked question that I know I get asked, probably you guys too,
YOU1000000000_S0000035	is what do you do with the cars once you're done testing them?
YOU1000000000_S0000036	So we sell the cars when we're done. So the first thing we do is a company-wide email goes out.
YOU1000000000_S0000037	to let all the employees know what cars we're currently selling, what the selling price, how many miles are on them.
YOU1000000000_S0000038	and the cars that aren't sold to employees, then they typically go to auction.
YOU1000000000_S0000039	We sell them there, and then we take that money to buy more test cars. And usually these cars have anywhere from 6,000 to 12,000 miles on them when we're done testing.
YOU1000000000_S0000040	Some have more. We keep some longer than others. Like let's say it has maybe some advanced safety features that we want to do more testing with.
YOU1000000000_S0000041	Or maybe there's a direct competitor of this car coming soon. We want to keep this current car in our test fleet.
YOU1000000000_S0000042	so that we have some really good back-to-back comparisons.
YOU1000000000_S0000043	And so considering what we have on hand right now, so Mike, what's kind of a go-to car that you find yourself signing up for?
YOU1000000000_S0000044	So I actually have a few go-to cars. I mean, one of them is the Hyundai Veloster Turbo.
YOU1000000000_S0000045	The only one we have of the man.
YOU1000000000_S0000046	It's the only car we currently have with a manual transmission. It has really great handling, really nice six-speed manual shifter.
YOU1000000000_S0000047	I actually don't go to it quite as much right now because it's quite cold. It has summer tires. Summer tires don't work as well in the winter.
YOU1000000000_S0000048	But when it's a warm-ish day, I'll take it. And it just kind of goes to show how important a manual transmission is.
YOU1000000000_S0000049	me because I actually don't even really love that car. It rides pretty stiff.
YOU1000000000_S0000050	And it's not like it has tons of power. And it's front wheel drive. I'm not a fan of front wheel drive performance cars.
YOU1000000000_S0000051	But it shows how much I love driving a manual transmission. I will drive that car any chance I get.
YOU1000000000_S0000052	But other cars that I go to, Genesis G70, it's like a nicer Kia Stinger. I love that.
YOU1000000000_S0000053	car. BMW X5, I mean, it's a fantastic SUV. It's just great in every way. Smooth, comfortable, nice powertrain.
YOU1000000000_S0000054	It probably doesn't get cold, it gets drier.
YOU1000000000_S0000055	I think, yeah. The keys are never available. And then the Ram 1500, because that is my favorite pickup truck. I love pickup trucks.
YOU1000000000_S0000056	It's so capable, yet drives almost like a car. And it has a great sounding V8.
YOU1000000000_S0000057	So those are my go-to's.
YOU1000000000_S0000058	And so Ryan, when you can choose, what do you find you're getting into?
YOU1000000000_S0000059	It's like I said earlier, it's winter, I've been going north a bunch. I use the X5 a lot.
YOU1000000000_S0000060	I like the Silverado. You mentioned the Veloster.
YOU1000000000_S0000061	I don't fit in it that well. It is fun to drive, but there's just times that I'm like, it's just frustrating because I don't fit in it that well.
YOU1000000000_S0000062	I find myself, as I've mentioned before, I go through SUV fatigue.
YOU1000000000_S0000063	I just sometimes get tired of it. I miss cars. Yeah, and I find myself signing out the Nissan Altima
YOU1000000000_S0000064	over and over. It's got heated seats, it's got a decent ride, it has Android Auto, so I've got a map.
YOU1000000000_S0000065	I've got my music. It's just an easy car to live with. It definitely has its faults as we found in our testing.
YOU1000000000_S0000066	But I just I just I'm comfortable in that car. I don't know. I don't know what else how else to put it
YOU1000000000_S0000067	And no one's fighting you for the keys.
YOU1000000000_S0000068	And no one's fighting me for the keys.
YOU1000000000_S0000069	But like you guys, I'm gravitating toward pickup trucks all the time. These are test vehicles.
YOU1000000000_S0000070	We take them to Home Depot, we go to the garden centers, we use them to work all the time.
YOU1000000000_S0000071	And I also am with you on the Ram and the Silverado, both great trucks.
YOU1000000000_S0000072	which kind of brings us to our next topic of what we're driving this week at the track.
YOU1000000000_S0000073	And so since clearly pickup trucks are big these days, we have our new 2019 Ford Ranger.
YOU1000000000_S0000074	This was hotly anticipated by those of us that love pickups. So Mike, if you could, give us a quick rundown of the Ranger and how it got here.
YOU1000000000_S0000075	Yeah, so the Ranger was first sold in the US in 1982 and it was sold here until the 2011 model year.
YOU1000000000_S0000076	And sales were strong for a while when that pickup first came out. But in the mid-2000s, sales started going down.
YOU1000000000_S0000077	pretty dramatically. And so that was a joint project. The Ranger between Mazda, they had the B-series pickup.
YOU1000000000_S0000078	that was basically almost identical to the Ranger.
YOU1000000000_S0000079	So Ford and Mazda looked at it and was like, you know, well, you know, is it worth with sales going down so much? Is it worth, you know, investing the money into?
YOU1000000000_S0000080	to totally redesign the truck. Because by 2011, that thing was really old. It was an aging truck. Oh, yeah.
YOU1000000000_S0000081	And so they decided to not have the truck here anymore.
YOU1000000000_S0000082	And then, you know, the market was basically this compact or midsize pickup segment was largely dominated by the Toyota Tacoma, has been for a long time.
YOU1000000000_S0000083	But the Nissan Frontier kept in there. But the Tacoma, especially, is quite an old design as well.
YOU1000000000_S0000084	Then Chevy with their Colorado and GMC with the twin, the Canyon.
YOU1000000000_S0000085	redesign their pickups. And I think Ford looked at it like, OK, hold it. We have a Ranger that's sold in other markets.
YOU1000000000_S0000086	This and you know the Ridgeline was redesigned came back was redesigned Jeep Gladiator is coming out
YOU1000000000_S0000087	I think they said we got to get back in this market because pickups are still hot in this country.
YOU1000000000_S0000088	And so they have this existing design sold elsewhere.
YOU1000000000_S0000089	They brought it back here, and that's where we are now, with this 2019 Ford Ranger.
YOU1000000000_S0000090	And not everyone needs a 1,500, a half-ton pickup truck.
YOU1000000000_S0000091	I mean, I need a 3,500 dually diesel, but that's just me. That's just me. You need a step ladder to get up in it.
YOU1000000000_S0000092	Come on. Another short joke. They have running boards. I have a hard time with this segment, because this truck, the Ranger we have, was about $40,000.
YOU1000000000_S0000094	you can get a full-size truck for a little more money. And I personally, I think it's crazy because I don't fit in these trucks as well.
YOU1000000000_S0000095	And it's half the truck. I mean, it doesn't make sense to me for that kind of money. If you are space conscious and you want a smaller vehicle, it makes some sense. But beyond that.
YOU1000000000_S0000096	And I posted on Consumer Reports Facebook page a picture of the new Rangers.
YOU1000000000_S0000097	we spent $40,000 plus and almost every comment was $40,000
YOU1000000000_S0000098	It's a lot of money for them.
YOU1000000000_S0000099	So we try to outfit the trucks a certain way. All cars, we try to outfit the way we think most people are going to, the way the truck's going to be sold. So that's why right now that truck's $40,000.
YOU1000000000_S0000101	Our current full-size trucks right now are ending up at about $50,000. So for $10,000 more, you're going to have a really nice full-size truck. Not a stripper, but those are going to be cheap.
YOU1000000000_S0000102	That's what I mean. You could, no. But anyway. Either way, I drove it. I was going to say, how does it drive? I drove it last night and I was pleased, actually.
YOU1000000000_S0000103	Because I went into it like, the Tacoma, I don't care for the Tacoma. The Tacoma's great, but I don't fit in it well.
YOU1000000000_S0000104	It doesn't excite me. When I drive it, I'm just, eh. The Colorado is the same thing. I fit in that better. This thing, I actually fit in it quite well. The seating position is nice. I can see.
YOU1000000000_S0000105	My Gripes, the powertrain, it's got a four cylinder EcoBoost.
YOU1000000000_S0000107	Yeah, and it has plenty of power, but it's not smooth. There's some sort of a driveline vibration, I feel. I'm not going to harp on that too much, because it might be this thing needs to break in a little more. It's only got 400,000 miles.
YOU1000000000_S0000108	400,000. Yeah, 400,000 miles. We didn't drive it that far.
YOU1000000000_S0000109	It broke our record for most miles on a convex road.
YOU1000000000_S0000110	It's only got 400 miles on it roughly and things are going to keep settling and breaking
YOU1000000000_S0000111	We've noticed that things like transmissions change over our break-in period. They sometimes quite often get smoother during the break-in period.
YOU1000000000_S0000112	And with the transmission, there was a couple of goofy shifts. And these things get ironed out.
YOU1000000000_S0000113	It's got plenty of power. I was happy with that. The Tacoma feels underpowered to me. Even the Colorado feels underpowered to me.
YOU1000000000_S0000114	This thing on the highway, I noticed quite a bit of wind noise from the door seals and the just the seals, I guess.
YOU1000000000_S0000116	Other than that, it's got...
YOU1000000000_S0000117	I'm with you in a lot of ways. I was actually really looking forward to this truck. So in some ways I was a little more let down.
YOU1000000000_S0000118	because I really think we need a really good compact. I think the market needs a really good compact pickup.
YOU1000000000_S0000119	It looks the part, no question about it. And it's a real truck, unlike the Honda Ridgeline, which is really just a glorified SUV with a car. It's basically a car.
YOU1000000000_S0000120	This is a real truck. The biggest gripe for me is the ride. It has one of the stiffest, bounciest rides, I think, of any pickup on the market right now.
YOU1000000000_S0000121	You think it's worse than the Tacoma?
YOU1000000000_S0000122	I'm not saying it's worse, I'm saying it's better.
YOU1000000000_S0000123	I think it rides better than the Koma.
YOU1000000000_S0000124	I think it's interesting.
YOU1000000000_S0000125	I'm with Ryan on this actually. It's not a smooth ride.
YOU1000000000_S0000127	So if you're a pickup person, you're going to put up with it. I had it for a weekend, and I put a lot of miles on it.
YOU1000000000_S0000128	And I was fine with it. But it's definitely noticeably bouncy on rougher roads. It's trucky, no question about it.
YOU1000000000_S0000129	So I think that's probably my biggest gripe is that if someone who buys a Ridgeline, it's completely different.
YOU1000000000_S0000130	You can't even compare those two.
YOU1000000000_S0000131	But people do, that's the problem. And we do, I mean, we compare them. So we have to.
YOU1000000000_S0000132	fan of the Ridgeline, it drives really nicely.
YOU1000000000_S0000133	I mean, of course it rides well.
YOU1000000000_S0000134	You know, I agree with you on the drivetrain, though. To me, it sounds wheezy.
YOU1000000000_S0000135	It sounds wheezy, yet it's got good power. It's really weird. It does. It shocks me. And then also keep in mind, it has a 10-speed automatic transmission.
YOU1000000000_S0000136	That's pretty impressive. And I found, in general, it shifts pretty smoothly. It's still breaking in.
YOU1000000000_S0000137	But there was a couple of times where I would be exiting a low speed turn and it was a little delay on figuring out which gear I wanted to be in.
YOU1000000000_S0000138	I don't like the 5 foot bed.
YOU1000000000_S0000139	I think, and you can't get, if you want the four-door crew cab like what we have, you can only get the five-foot bed.
YOU1000000000_S0000140	So the way the Ranger works is, if you get the smaller, you know, extra cab or whatever, you get the six foot bed.
YOU1000000000_S0000141	If you get the four-door crew cab, it's only the five-foot bed. So you don't have a, those are your choices. There's no bed choices.
YOU1000000000_S0000142	Basically, whereas, say, the Chevrolet Colorado, you can get the longer bed with the bigger cab.
YOU1000000000_S0000143	And the other thing, just like the running boards are just placed awkwardly, there's no grab handle to get in, on a pickup that sits that high, they're
YOU1000000000_S0000144	It should be a grab handle to get in. It is kind of tall, I noticed, too.
YOU1000000000_S0000145	Just one more thing on handling, I thought was interesting. Is this thing feels like a miniature F-150.
YOU1000000000_S0000146	It got that dull, slow kind of steering. It's kind of just dead.
YOU1000000000_S0000147	Yeah, and when you turn it actually has body roll, like it kind of dives a little bit.
YOU1000000000_S0000148	And that's kind of that trucky feel. I don't think it's the end of the world. But it was interesting to me that it reacted kind of like that. Because a Colorado is nothing like a Silverado.
YOU1000000000_S0000149	Right. In my eyes.
YOU1000000000_S0000150	So keep checking back to Consumer Reports.
YOU1000000000_S0000151	still fresh. Yeah, we have a lot of this is just our early impressions
YOU1000000000_S0000152	We're going to have more information pretty soon. We're going to have a first drive and a video, which takes us to our next section of questions.
YOU1000000000_S0000153	Please send us your video and text questions to TalkingCarsAticloud.com.
YOU1000000000_S0000154	First up is a video question about the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, and let's take a listen.
YOU1000000000_S0000155	Hello CRT, I and my husband are expecting baby in June and we are in the market to buy our first car in next month or so.
YOU1000000000_S0000156	I have a question about 2019 RAV4 Hybrid AWD system.
YOU1000000000_S0000157	I have learned that the rear is disconnected from the front and the rear wheels get power from the auxiliary battery which get charged when brakes are applied.
YOU1000000000_S0000158	Does this mean that on a snowy highway when we need all wheel drive constantly,
YOU1000000000_S0000159	When we are driving this car at a steady pace without using too much brakes, then I am turning into a risk of depleting the battery
YOU1000000000_S0000160	and soon the car turning into just front wheel drive? What is the probability of battery getting discharged completely considering we have a lot of snow in north east Canada
YOU1000000000_S0000161	and sometimes we may need all wheel drive for prolonged period of 6-7 hours. And if it's a big problem, then should we disregard RAV4 hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000162	and look for alternate hybrid like rogue hybrid
YOU1000000000_S0000163	Wow, what a great question, and clearly shows that Talking Cars listeners and viewers are very, very smart and highly educated.
YOU1000000000_S0000164	She knows what she's talking about here. Yeah, so the new RAV4 hybrid is actually going to have the same hybrid system that they've been using this hybrid system since the first Highlander hybrid.
YOU1000000000_S0000165	And I remember this distinctly because I can remember being in a snowstorm watching a Highlander hybrid, brand new car, stuck, front wheel drive, looked like it was front wheel drive, trying to climb a hill.
YOU1000000000_S0000166	And this is because this car has a gasoline engine, and it's technically a front-wheel drive car. And the hybrid system is a completely separate unit in the rear.
YOU1000000000_S0000167	batteries, electric motors, separately controlled at the rear. Now,
YOU1000000000_S0000168	In theory, they say this thing, when you take off, it's going to give you power.
YOU1000000000_S0000169	Got the rear wheels if it senses slip and it can help you go. Over time though you can drain that battery down.
YOU1000000000_S0000170	and you are left with potentially a front-wheel drive vehicle.
YOU1000000000_S0000171	Well, I mean, and just to do a little contrast, as opposed to a traditional
YOU1000000000_S0000172	all-wheel drive, four-wheel drive. It doesn't have a big drive shaft running down the middle. Yeah, it would have a drive shaft going to the rear. Right, where you can lock everything up.
YOU1000000000_S0000173	Exactly. And it's neat. It's a neat idea. But I mean, I've seen this thing struggle.
YOU1000000000_S0000174	And they're using the same technology. The brand new 2019 RAV4 is going to have the same system in it.
YOU1000000000_S0000175	So for her, if she's really weighing heavily on having all-wheel drive, I wouldn't use this as a substitute for that.
YOU1000000000_S0000176	At the same time, you don't need all-wheel drive all the time, even in the snow.
YOU1000000000_S0000177	if it sounds like she's mostly concerned about highway drives in snow.
YOU1000000000_S0000178	Well, you know, hopefully she has four snow tires because that's actually the most important thing is if she drives in a lot of snow.
YOU1000000000_S0000179	She should have four snow tires. And then even if it was only front wheel drive, she'd in most cases still be fine. And keep in mind, this system was designed to be in front drive.
YOU1000000000_S0000180	as much as possible for efficiency's sake. For efficiency, right. So therefore, for the most part, it's only going to switch to all-wheel drive.
YOU1000000000_S0000181	when it, like you said, it senses slip. So a lot of the time, even in snow, she's going to be driving down the highway.
YOU1000000000_S0000182	it's going to want to be in front wheel drive anyway until it senses that slip. But even then, really the more important thing.
YOU1000000000_S0000183	is snow tires. Right. Yeah, absolutely. But unless she might notice a problem on steep uphills.
YOU1000000000_S0000184	on the highway or even more so on back roads is really where there's going to potentially be a problem.
YOU1000000000_S0000185	if she were to be unlucky that the battery is drained when she's trying to go up a steep, slippery uphill.
YOU1000000000_S0000186	Having a new kid, I mean, I'd be nervous to tell her that this is a good idea.
YOU1000000000_S0000187	So you could say, well, so she's thinking about another hybrid, the Nissan Rogue hybrid.
YOU1000000000_S0000188	But the problem is a lot of these hybrids, they're going to work. They become all-wheel drive in a similar way.
YOU1000000000_S0000189	So maybe a hybrid all-wheel drive is not her best choice. Correct.
YOU1000000000_S0000190	alternative that we talked about is one of Consumer Reports' top-rated vehicles, the Subaru Forester.
YOU1000000000_S0000191	which you don't have to worry about the all-wheel drive system, kind of saying bye bye.
YOU1000000000_S0000192	when you're using it.
YOU1000000000_S0000193	It's not going to be as efficient, but it's still quite efficient.
YOU1000000000_S0000195	efficiency or do you want the safety of being right now stuck
YOU1000000000_S0000196	Now she has no more worries about the all-wheel drive system not being there when she needs it.
YOU1000000000_S0000197	Thanks for your question, very astute, you clearly know your cars. And now we're going to move on to the next one, which is getting a used EV and winter driving.
YOU1000000000_S0000198	The question reads, I live in New Hampshire and looking to get an EV car. I'm looking at a used BMW i3.
YOU1000000000_S0000199	a used Tesla Model S or a new Model 3 all rear-wheel drive.
YOU1000000000_S0000200	How does an EV rear-wheel drive handle in the snow with snow tires of course? Thank you CR for teaching me about snow tires.
YOU1000000000_S0000201	I normally think best to worst, all-wheel drive, front-wheel drive.
YOU1000000000_S0000202	and rear-wheel drive with internal combustion engine cars. Where would an EV rear-wheel drive fit into that lineup?
YOU1000000000_S0000203	So, Ryan, tire man, tell us pros and cons.
YOU1000000000_S0000204	This is an interesting question because
YOU1000000000_S0000206	That's not an easy answer. The first thing that comes to mind is he says he lives in New Hampshire.
YOU1000000000_S0000207	It's cold there almost half of the year. It's cold there in August. I'm kidding. My first reservation would be having an electric car in a cold climate.
YOU1000000000_S0000208	Because it would drive you nuts. You lose a lot of range. The batteries, worst enemy is the cold.
YOU1000000000_S0000209	We did a story on this recently on ArkansasReports.org.
YOU1000000000_S0000210	first issue. But going back to what he's saying, 100% you have to have snow tires. A rear-wheel drive car is going to
YOU1000000000_S0000211	A rear-wheel drive electric car, because you have electric motors, they have regenerative braking.
YOU1000000000_S0000212	My concern would be when you lift off the throttle, you're going to have to get used to this. When you lift off the throttle, it's essentially dragging at the rear end. You're creating a rear brake.
YOU1000000000_S0000213	Which is a weird feeling on a dry surface.
YOU1000000000_S0000214	Dry road, right. Now, if it's a slippery surface, they're going to be dragging. And if it's really slippery, the stability control of the car is going to be doing a lot of work.
YOU1000000000_S0000215	Now, you're not going to spin out of control. We have modern stability controls, very good, especially in these cars.
YOU1000000000_S0000216	Is it going to go in the snow? Absolutely. I think there's going to be some learning curve there of driving it smoothly and not dealing with all that, the stability control going crazy.
YOU1000000000_S0000217	He's right. I mean, an all-wheel drive car is probably your best bet with snow tires, of course.
YOU1000000000_S0000218	When it comes to front and rear wheel drive, it's preference. I mean, I drove a BMW for years with two sandbags and snow tires, and I went anywhere I needed to go.
YOU1000000000_S0000219	But I preferred that. For the average driver, maybe front wheel drives a little bit better with snow tires. That's a preference.
YOU1000000000_S0000220	I think that front wheel drive is easier to control for most drivers because you don't have to worry about power around oversteer like you do with a rear wheel drive car. Rear wheel drive car is definitely more fun.
YOU1000000000_S0000221	But what I don't like about front-wheel drive cars is you're asking the front wheels to do two things. Two things. Both power that drive the car.
YOU1000000000_S0000222	power the car forwards and also steer the car. And that's what I like about.
YOU1000000000_S0000223	rear-wheel drive cars. But I think the bigger question is, why does this person want, is there a specific reason he's looking for rear-wheel drive?
YOU1000000000_S0000224	And if that's the case, then if you want the rear-wheel drive because you find it more fun to drive, then go for it.
YOU1000000000_S0000225	But you could go with a little newer Tesla.
YOU1000000000_S0000226	and get all-wheel drive. So that's another option.
YOU1000000000_S0000227	But the most interesting thing about these electric cars, though, is I looked up the weight distribution. And it's actually not bad.
YOU1000000000_S0000228	I mean, so for instance, the I3 is 55% of the weight is to the rear. This is, you know, our testing.
YOU1000000000_S0000229	The Model S rear drive was 53% to the rear, Model 3, 52%
YOU1000000000_S0000230	So this is what we put on our scale. We put on our scale. So the point is, there's some weight back there. A lot of cars are, a lot of rear-wheel drive cars are more 50-50.
YOU1000000000_S0000231	So you've got a little bit more weight over the rear to give you some traction, but the most important thing is with snow tires and ABS,
YOU1000000000_S0000232	traction control, and electronic stability control, you're going to be fine even with rear-wheel drive.
YOU1000000000_S0000233	Right, I was going to make the argument with the front wheel drive, the weight is over the drive wheels.
YOU1000000000_S0000234	So in slippery conditions, that's usually. But it gets complicated.
YOU1000000000_S0000235	It does get complicated because the weight transfer goes rearward.
YOU1000000000_S0000236	Thanks so much for your question. Kind of brings us to our final one. Unfortunately, we got to wrap this up. The question reads,
YOU1000000000_S0000237	Love your show. I drive a 2018 Accord EXL and love all the driver systems.
YOU1000000000_S0000238	I drove the car in light snow and after 10 minutes I got a message on the screen that the radar is obstructed.
YOU1000000000_S0000239	meaning no driver assist, which you're probably seeing on your screen right now. What can one conclude from that about self-driving cars in the winter?
YOU1000000000_S0000241	Exactly our concern. Right. All of this technology. And that's why self-driving cars aren't here yet. Yes.
YOU1000000000_S0000242	One of the reasons. Sensors is a broad term. There's all different types of sensors. There's optical, there's eyesight, there's sonar. There's all kinds of sensors.
YOU1000000000_S0000243	If they're clogged up or there's something in the way, they're not going to work well. And if you're relying on that to save your life, you're crazy. Right.
YOU1000000000_S0000244	Right. This is the weak spot of this technology. It's not perfect. And he didn't drive far, and it was already not working. So this is a major concern of ours.
YOU1000000000_S0000245	Yeah. And we've done a story. We recently did a story on consumerreports.org called How to Keep Your Car's Safety Sensors Clean.
YOU1000000000_S0000246	when snow and ice attack. So the reality is that there's radar sensors on the front of a lot of new cars
YOU1000000000_S0000247	that have forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, usually in the grille, quite often in the emblem. The emblems have gotten quite huge these days.
YOU1000000000_S0000248	and so they have those radar sensors in there. And so what can happen is snow, ice, salt can get all grimed up on there.
YOU1000000000_S0000249	And so when that happens, the system's going to shut down because it knows it can't see what it needs to see anymore.
YOU1000000000_S0000250	And it will give you a warning on your dashboard that this has happened. But now forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking aren't going to work anymore. So you can no longer rely on them.
YOU1000000000_S0000251	It's a little bit regional because if you're in the snow belt, this is going to be a bigger issue. But still, sand and dust and mud in the southern states is eventually going to do the same thing. You have to keep these things clean.
YOU1000000000_S0000252	And you also need to keep in mind, there's sensors all around your cars these days. Lots of them, yeah. For blind spot warning and things like that.
YOU1000000000_S0000253	and your rear view camera. There's a little lens back there that you, even in rain.
YOU1000000000_S0000254	If you've been driving in the rain and you put the car in reverse, it's very blurry back there because it has water all over it.
YOU1000000000_S0000255	So it's important to keep these sensors clean if you are driving on a snowy trip or whatever, and it gives you that warning.
YOU1000000000_S0000256	you know, pull over at the next rest area that you can and clean off the front grill.
YOU1000000000_S0000257	And we actually did a, I believe we did a video on this with Jen Stockburger. That's online, right? Producer Dave, can people check that video out?
YOU1000000000_S0000258	Sure. So check out that video, because Jen tells you, she shows you where all the sensors are on the cars and how to clean them.
YOU1000000000_S0000259	But the more important thing is where they are. And also, your owner's manual will tell you where all those sensors are on your specific car. And that's very important to know that.
YOU1000000000_S0000260	when you get this warning that, hey, these things aren't working right anymore. Well, you need to know where they are so you can clean them.
YOU1000000000_S0000261	Well, that's going to do it for this episode. If you want to learn more about the topics of the cars that we've talked about, check out the show notes. And keep those questions coming. Be talking cars at iCloud.com.
YOU1000000000_S0000262	Thanks so much for tuning in. We'll see you next week.

YOU1000000002_S0000001	The Wuhan coronavirus began, like all new viruses, with a remarkably ordinary moment.
YOU1000000002_S0000002	In late November 2019, someone—it is not yet known who—ate a wild animal that, by chance, carried the novel coronavirus
YOU1000000002_S0000003	and days later, started to feel the symptoms of what initially seemed like a bad cold.
YOU1000000002_S0000004	From there, more individuals were infected—at first through the consumption of other wild animals, but later through direct human-to-human transmission.
YOU1000000002_S0000005	For the entire month of December, the virus was there, in Wuhan, spreading, but nobody knew it.
YOU1000000002_S0000006	The cases, presenting as pneumonia, were at first considered to be caused by any one of the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms
YOU1000000002_S0000007	But eventually, the escalation in cases, and the fact that almost all the first patients had bought food at one particular wild animal market, caught the Wuhan city government's attention.
YOU1000000002_S0000008	The first official confirmation that something was up came on New Year's Eve.
YOU1000000002_S0000009	December 31st, when the Municipal Health Commission published a press release acknowledging the situation.
YOU1000000002_S0000010	over a month after the first transmission. At the time, this was small, local news.
YOU1000000002_S0000011	only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of millions, in a country of a billion.
YOU1000000002_S0000012	But then came the news that this was not one of the many pre-existing pneumonia-causing viruses.
YOU1000000002_S0000013	This was something new. Western media first reported on the novel coronavirus around January 8th.
YOU1000000002_S0000014	The New York Times, forebodingly, wrote, "...there is no evidence that the new virus is readily spread by humans, and it has not been tied to any deaths."
YOU1000000002_S0000015	That would soon change.
YOU1000000002_S0000016	On January 21, when the World Health Organization started tracking the outbreak, there were 282 cases.
YOU1000000002_S0000017	The next day, 314. The next, 581.
YOU1000000002_S0000018	than 846, than 1,320,
YOU1000000002_S0000019	than 2014, and by the start of the week of January 26, it was clear that this would not be a quick and painless virus.
YOU1000000002_S0000020	This would be one for the history books, and it was going to get a lot worse before it got any better.
YOU1000000002_S0000021	Drastic circumstances called for drastic action. It was clear, given the trends, that Wuhan's hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients
YOU1000000002_S0000022	and, in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus, that makes a bad situation worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home.
YOU1000000002_S0000023	where the virus can more easily spread. Therefore, the decision was made, on January 23rd, to build a brand new facility capable of treating 1,000 patients at once.
YOU1000000002_S0000024	It was announced that this would be done, fully constructed, by February 2nd.
YOU1000000002_S0000025	just 10 days later.
YOU1000000002_S0000026	China has experience with such a feat. In 2003, the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which is also caused by a form of coronavirus.
YOU1000000002_S0000027	Much like with the novel coronavirus, hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away patients.
YOU1000000002_S0000028	In response, the government decided to build a new hospital.
YOU1000000002_S0000029	Over six days, 7,000 construction workers brought the Xiaotongshan Hospital into reality and it quickly began accepting patients and relieving the overstressed medical system.
YOU1000000002_S0000030	Once the outbreak settled down, the Shaotongshan Hospital was hailed as a massive success by both the country itself and the World Health Organization.
YOU1000000002_S0000031	The statistics speak for themselves—overall, SARS had a fatality rate of 9.6%.
YOU1000000002_S0000032	At the Xiaochunshan Hospital, just 1.2% of patients died.
YOU1000000002_S0000033	and not a single staff member was infected.
YOU1000000002_S0000034	It's no wonder why China wanted to replicate this.
YOU1000000002_S0000035	and therefore Xiaotongshan was the model for the new coronavirus hospital, but this time would be different.
YOU1000000002_S0000036	The 2003 hospital began construction over six months after the beginning of the outbreak.
YOU1000000002_S0000037	The 2020 hospital started construction less than two months after the first case and just days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear.
YOU1000000002_S0000038	There was far less time for planning and design. The orders came, and then it was immediately time to start.
YOU1000000002_S0000039	Step one was finding a place to put the hospital.
YOU1000000002_S0000040	The location selected was previously just an open field about 14 miles or 22 kilometers from central Wuhan.
YOU1000000002_S0000041	This kept it away from the dense urban core, where further transmission might be easier, but the field in question was also right off a large pre-existing road which made access easy.
YOU1000000002_S0000042	That road was quickly shut down and turned into, essentially, a parking lot and staging area for the project.
YOU1000000002_S0000043	The contract for this project was given to China Construction 3rd Engineering Bureau Company, a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Construction Engineering Corporation.
YOU1000000002_S0000044	By revenue, this is the world's largest construction company and it has experience in enormous projects like Beijing's new airport, Egypt's new capital city, and Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory.
YOU1000000002_S0000045	If anyone was going to pull this off, it was them.
YOU1000000002_S0000046	To begin construction in earnest, they first needed to prepare the selected site.
YOU1000000002_S0000047	That involved, first, cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly leveling the ground.
YOU1000000002_S0000048	Out of the 10-day construction timeline, this took longer than one might think.
YOU1000000002_S0000049	about 48 hours.
YOU1000000002_S0000050	This was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly understaffed in its first few days.
YOU1000000002_S0000051	as they scramble to find workers, especially as its start coincided with Chinese New Year's.
YOU1000000002_S0000052	Once the land was leveled, though, they moved on to constructing the building foundations by Sunday, January 26.
YOU1000000002_S0000053	For this, they used a layered system.
YOU1000000002_S0000054	On the bottom, an 8 inch or 20 centimeter layer of sand was placed, then what's referred to as a geotextile layer,
YOU1000000002_S0000055	a form of fabric, then a layer of waterproof plastic, then another geotextile layer, then another layer of sand.
YOU1000000002_S0000056	On that, they then poured concrete, which dried over a few days.
YOU1000000002_S0000057	But then came the truly impressive element.
YOU1000000002_S0000058	constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days.
YOU1000000002_S0000059	What made this possible was the use of prefabricated elements.
YOU1000000002_S0000060	Modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently.
YOU1000000002_S0000061	It's now a well-established technique for the construction of buildings large and small.
YOU1000000002_S0000062	The idea is, simply, that somewhere off-site a number of identical building elements are built.
YOU1000000002_S0000063	Then, they're shipped to the construction site and put together.
YOU1000000002_S0000064	This has plenty of advantages.
YOU1000000002_S0000065	First and foremost, the use of identical elements, built in a factory system, to construct a larger building lowers costs through economies of scale.
YOU1000000002_S0000066	Then, when you actually get to putting the building together, on-site construction time is significantly less.
YOU1000000002_S0000067	which once again lowers cost.
YOU1000000002_S0000068	In this case, though, cost was not the primary concern.
YOU1000000002_S0000069	Speed-wise, and modular construction is the fastest way to build.
YOU1000000002_S0000070	Most of the site used a type of prefabricated, modular construction common with temporary buildings.
YOU1000000002_S0000071	While it's not clear which company produced the prefabricated components, it is clear that they existed before the project started.
YOU1000000002_S0000072	The first building elements started coming together on Monday, January 27th, just four days after the project broke ground.
YOU1000000002_S0000073	They began by building the skeleton of the modular units.
YOU1000000002_S0000074	Each of these units was about the shape and size of a 20-foot shipping container
YOU1000000002_S0000075	and this skeleton form included just the floor, ceiling, and structural supports at each corner.
YOU1000000002_S0000076	Throughout this all, separate teams, out of the thousands of workers there, started to hook the site up to utilities like sewage, water, electricity, and internets.
YOU1000000002_S0000077	Much of this just involved bringing in the state-owned companies responsible for these, but for internets, and the subsequent building out of an IT system, private companies like Huawei and Lenovo got involved.
YOU1000000002_S0000078	This was, no doubt, partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable public attention in China.
YOU1000000002_S0000079	It came to represent the physical manifestation of the country's response to the crisis and also of China's engineering might.
YOU1000000002_S0000080	The construction process itself was streamed by state-owned broadcasting companies, and up to 18 million concurrent viewers watched the process.
YOU1000000002_S0000081	Nearly every major broadcaster in China reported from the site, publishing footage like what you're seeing now, although very few western broadcasters were there.
YOU1000000002_S0000082	This is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction exists outside of China's state-owned broadcasters.
YOU1000000002_S0000083	where the government can manage the story and what gets out.
YOU1000000002_S0000084	It was, no doubt, viewed as an opportunity by the Chinese government in a time when it faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak.
YOU1000000002_S0000085	But, of course, to gain that praise, the project needed to be successful.
YOU1000000002_S0000086	On Tuesday, January 28th, significant portions of the first building were completed, while the rest of the complex's foundations were finishing up.
YOU1000000002_S0000087	Over the 29th and 30th, more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed on and in the skeletons of buildings, and work then began on turning these empty buildings into a hospital.
YOU1000000002_S0000088	Each patient room was outfitted with two beds, some medical equipment, and a bathroom.
YOU1000000002_S0000089	Considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind, there are some unique aspects to the design of these rooms.
YOU1000000002_S0000090	For one, the ventilation system is built to keep negative pressure in all quarantine areas so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into the rest of the hospital.
YOU1000000002_S0000091	While at the time of writing it's not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can spread through airborne transmission, a ventilation system like this is standard practice for any quarantine ward.
YOU1000000002_S0000092	In addition to individual patient rooms, separate areas were designed for patient processing, diagnostic tools like CT scanners were installed, and other crucial aspects like offices, break rooms, and canteens were built in.
YOU1000000002_S0000093	Over the 31st of January and 1st and 2nd of February, the final areas of the complex were built up, the interior installation was ramped up, and all the systems were tested to assure that the hospital was ready to bring in patients.
YOU1000000002_S0000094	Meanwhile, eight People's Liberation Army transport planes landed at Wuhan airport carrying the military medical staff who had staffed the hospital.
YOU1000000002_S0000095	They moved into the facility throughout the same day, February 2nd, then throughout the night, workers put the finishing touches onto the hundreds of rooms.
YOU1000000002_S0000096	Then, the next morning, the moment that ten days prior seemed impossible arrived.
YOU1000000002_S0000097	The first patients, transferred from other facilities, were wheeled into Houshenshan Hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations.
YOU1000000002_S0000098	They started with just a few dozen patients, but in a matter of days, this ballooned to hundreds.
YOU1000000002_S0000099	Huoshenshan Hospital was only the start of China's plan to ramp up the number of available beds in Wuhan.
YOU1000000002_S0000100	Just three days after He Shunshan's opening, another, even larger hospital called Lei Shunshan opened.
YOU1000000002_S0000101	Its 1,600 beds and 32 wards were built in just 12 days.
YOU1000000002_S0000102	Meanwhile, other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients, and stadiums and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well.
YOU1000000002_S0000103	Still, though, even with this swift, decisive action, reports indicate that many of those with milder cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in Wuhan.
YOU1000000002_S0000104	It unfortunately seems that coronavirus, with its tremendous severity, is one of the few things that can outpace China.
YOU1000000002_S0000105	If you want to learn more about how viruses such as this work from a biological perspective, CuriosityStream has a fascinating short documentary on one previous epidemic.
YOU1000000002_S0000106	the Zika virus.

YOU1000000004_S0000001	Hey everyone, thanks for tuning in to another WordPress Wednesday. Today wraps up our series that we've done on social media plugins.
YOU1000000004_S0000002	How to use a hashtag. All things social media having to do with WordPress specifically. We've looked at a lot of different options for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest. All sorts of different networks.
YOU1000000004_S0000003	If you've missed all those, be sure to check those out. I'll put some links in the description box below so you can check those out and get some ideas.
YOU1000000004_S0000004	for how to be using those social networks to improve your branding reach and even to just improve the experience that your users have on those networks.
YOU1000000004_S0000005	Today I want to talk about how to get your posts in WordPress automatically published at least to Facebook.
YOU1000000004_S0000006	I've got a couple of other options that you'll be able to get your post published across the board to a ton of different networks all at once.
YOU1000000004_S0000007	I first want to start off by showing you a free option because if you've watched my channel, you know that free is always in the budget, right?
YOU1000000004_S0000008	So, we want to look at... I'm just going to show you one here for a second. This again is how to get your
YOU1000000004_S0000010	blog posts. As soon as you click publish on a blog post, we want it to automatically connect over to your Facebook page.
YOU1000000004_S0000011	and do an excerpt, a little blurb over there. Maybe also include your featured image over there. Then, of course, put a link to get people to come back to your website.
YOU1000000004_S0000012	Now, if you're only interested in using this for one network, Facebook is probably the obvious choice there. It's not too much of a time saver.
YOU1000000004_S0000013	but if you're really trying to connect across multiple networks, this could really be a time saver for you.
YOU1000000004_S0000014	Of course, if you're running on the .com version of WordPress, you probably know about Jetpack. Inside of Jetpack you have an option for something like this called Publicize.
YOU1000000004_S0000015	Take a look at that one. That's available inside of Jetpack. If you haven't wanted to use this because of the heaviness- the weight of what Jetpack is on your website.
YOU1000000004_S0000016	There's another option. Let's do this. We're, of course, in our dashboard. We are in the add new area. I want to do a search for
YOU1000000004_S0000018	Access, press, Facebook is what we're going to do a search for. You can see that right here. Access, press, Facebook.
YOU1000000004_S0000019	This is the option that comes up that we are looking for. This is AccessPress is the developer's name of this particular plugin.
YOU1000000004_S0000020	I'm not making money off of advertising this. I'm just showing you a solution that I've found in the free range. Now it only has 9,000 installs. It's relatively new.
YOU1000000004_S0000021	It has been updated a day ago, so that's great. We know that this author cares to keep this plugin secure for us. Then, of course, it says here that it's compatible with our version of WordPress.
YOU1000000004_S0000022	You always want to check that. If this is later on down the road that you're viewing this video, please be sure before you click install on this that it is up to date.
YOU1000000004_S0000023	that it's at least been updated within the last six months, that it's still compatible with your version, and that it still has great reviews and a lot of active installs. You just go ahead and click install.
YOU1000000004_S0000025	Because I'm on WP Engine with my hosting, they of course give you a quick alert and say, hey are you sure that you want to do this before you do a backup.
YOU1000000004_S0000026	And I normally just go for it. Living on the edge, people, living on the edge.
YOU1000000004_S0000027	Once you activate it, you've installed it and you've activated it. Down here on the left side of your dashboard, now you will have an access point to get in here and run through the settings.
YOU1000000004_S0000028	Now, all that was pretty simple and straight forward. It's installing any plugin.
YOU1000000004_S0000029	Here's where it gets a little bit more nerd code style. Wrap your brain around this. Don't get intimidated by this because all it is is simple instruction.
YOU1000000004_S0000030	We follow the instructions, click through and we're able to basically build what we call an API or a bridge between your social media network, Facebook, and your website.
YOU1000000004_S0000031	So we've got to connect the two and give them, in a sense, permission to connect. And that's what we're about to do here.
YOU1000000004_S0000032	Step by step instructions. Of course, it sends an alert right now. It says we haven't done it yet. You need to go ahead and authorize your account to connect with each other.
YOU1000000004_S0000033	You're going to be looking to copy and paste in some things here. Now, this gives us clear instruction.
YOU1000000004_S0000034	Please visit here and create a new Facebook application to get Application ID and Application Secret. We're going to click here. I've already got a few created.
YOU1000000004_S0000035	All you do is click this green button that says, Add New. Of course, I'm already logged in to my Facebook account. We want to connect it with a website.
YOU1000000004_S0000036	So you click website. And then here you go, quick start for website. You just go ahead and type in what it is.
YOU1000000004_S0000037	As you walk through this, at the end of this process, it is going to give you the simple code that you copy and paste into these areas.
YOU1000000004_S0000038	and they will tell you that it's an application ID and it's an application secret. You'll be able to copy and paste it in.
YOU1000000004_S0000039	Then it says, click here to get your Facebook ID. You'll click there and it'll tell you what to paste in there.
YOU1000000004_S0000040	That's kind of how you do it. You're just going to walk down through all these options down here at the top and bottom. It's saying, do you want to allow us to auto-publish your posts?
YOU1000000004_S0000041	and your pages. Maybe all the other things you have going on or simply just your posts for your blog. It's really up to you. You can make that choice right here.
YOU1000000004_S0000042	Once you've got all those settings in place, you'll click save settings. You'll be able to start broadcasting these as soon as you click publish.
YOU1000000004_S0000043	So if that's kind of too fast, the other cool thing that's in this plugin
YOU1000000004_S0000044	is check this out. You've got an option right here, how to use. They've got a quick tutorial video that's probably a little bit more advanced than mine.
YOU1000000004_S0000045	They're going to really help you understand how to set all this up. Just take a moment and read through this. I know we don't always like to read. We like to watch videos.
YOU1000000004_S0000046	But, take a moment and read through these instructions. This developer really wants to hold your hand and get you successfully publishing.
YOU1000000004_S0000047	Here's the other thing this really cool author will do. If you're looking to publish across a bunch of networks all at once, they do have a pro version of this.
YOU1000000004_S0000048	I'll put the link to this in the description box below. This particular Pro version allows you to publish to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Tumblr all at one time.
YOU1000000004_S0000049	It's a $20 one time fee for you to purchase this pro version and install it and run it.
YOU1000000004_S0000050	It again, it has pretty good reviews. It's still kind of new. It's just again been updated this year. So, that's great.
YOU1000000004_S0000051	If you're looking to go just big and you say, you know what Kori? I'm using 10 different networks and I really need a time saver and I don't always like having to go over to something like Hootsuite.
YOU1000000004_S0000052	and still set everything up. I really do want that one magic button that as soon as I click it, it blasts out across the board. I'll give you one more.
YOU1000000004_S0000053	This is a premium plugin. I'll give you one more option here. It's called Next Scripts.
YOU1000000004_S0000054	For free, they allow you to use one network. If you're looking to do just Instagram, or if you're looking to do just Twitter, or just Facebook, this allows you one free.
YOU1000000004_S0000055	The second you want to do more than that, it's going to immediately ask that you buy the pro version. I think right now it's on sale for $50 per year.
YOU1000000004_S0000056	So, it's a little bit more pricey- $50.00. But, check this out. Let's see if I can show you. Oh my word! If I can show you what all... Oh, over here. Watch this.
YOU1000000004_S0000057	Look at this you guys. Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Blogger, Tumblr, Flickr. I mean there's Instagram in here. There's Pinterest in here. There's LinkedIn in here.
YOU1000000004_S0000058	There's all sorts of ones that you can just check out and see what all is available. Look at all these just down the row here.
YOU1000000004_S0000059	all these different networks that it immediately allows you to sync your website to. With that magic click of publish, it will broadcast out.
YOU1000000004_S0000060	Of course, each one of these as you install it, you'll have to make that connection per network at least one time. You'll have to set that up and give permissions for your website to speak to that network.
YOU1000000004_S0000061	and then you're off and running. I hope this has helped you. If you've used any of these tools or if you have another one in mind that you've used
YOU1000000004_S0000062	Would you put it in the description box or in the comments below so that we can all kind of share our knowledge and grow our WordPress community?
YOU1000000004_S0000063	I hope you're having a great one. I will see you next week for another WordPress Wednesday. Bye, y'all.
YOU1000000006_S0000000	So you're looking to generate real estate leads for your business. Well, I want to show you guys one of the top performing Facebook ads that we have used with thousands of real estate agents.
YOU1000000006_S0000001	to help them generate a consistent flow of real estate leads for their business. And if you guys want this Facebook ad copy, this template,
YOU1000000006_S0000002	Just go ahead and drop a comment, just say real estate leads down in the comment section and I will be able to share this template with you 100% free so you can just copy and paste this into your business.
YOU1000000006_S0000003	So just go ahead, drop a comment, real estate leads down in the comment section and give this video a thumbs up. Now, let me just walk you through this template.
YOU1000000006_S0000004	And then I wanna show you guys how to get this all set up in just a couple of clicks as well for your business so you know how to actually implement this.
YOU1000000006_S0000005	So this is a Facebook ad to market a new listing and the same thing works on Instagram because
YOU1000000006_S0000006	because Facebook owns Instagram, so when you set up a Facebook ad, you're also actually setting up an Instagram ad. So that's pretty cool because you can spend $10 per day.
YOU1000000006_S0000007	And you don't have to spend $10 per day on Facebook and $10 per day on Instagram. You spend $10 per day and it's split evenly between both platforms. So you're getting the most exposure.
YOU1000000006_S0000008	for your real estate business. All right, so right here we've got this, your Facebook page. So this is the demo page I'm using obviously, but you're going to be using it from your page.
YOU1000000006_S0000009	So let's say Jason Wardrop and you want to have a profile picture of yourself because a big part of social media is personal branding.
YOU1000000006_S0000010	So you want to brand yourself, you want to brand your business, but you want to have it from your personal Facebook business page. So now moving down into the actual Facebook ad copy.
YOU1000000006_S0000011	I like to have some emojis because it kind of pops out at people. They stop and they check out what's going on. And then also when you do the hashtag, it makes it all blue. And so once again, that kind of pops out at people.
YOU1000000006_S0000012	And then we've got see it before anyone else five bedrooms and normally I would put like how many baths as well right here But go here to get the price location plus more pictures
YOU1000000006_S0000013	So when you're generating leads, what you want to do is you want to hold back some information or make something enticing enough for somebody to give you their contact information. So their name, phone number, email address.
YOU1000000006_S0000014	So you can actually follow up with them and connect with them to help them out with whatever they're looking to do. So buy or sell a home, right?
YOU1000000006_S0000015	And so what we're going to do is we're going to kind of give a quick little rundown about this home, but we're going to hold back enough that we're not going to give them all the information so their interest is peaked.
YOU1000000006_S0000016	and then we can actually go through and generate a lead. So we've got this first call to action here, and this is sending to a landing page.
YOU1000000006_S0000017	Okay, so I'll show you what that looks like right here. Okay, and we're not sending them to our website or our blog. Okay, when you send them to a website or blog, they're not optimized for conversions.
YOU1000000006_S0000018	landing pages are and so that's why I want to send them specifically to a landing page. Okay, and then the next couple of paragraphs we're going to have right here.
YOU1000000006_S0000019	Is a couple of paragraphs talking about the features of the home. Okay, things that people are going to like find interesting. Are they vaulted ceilings? Is there a pool in the backyard?
YOU1000000006_S0000020	It's a three-car garage. How big is the lot? Is it close to parks or is it close to schools? Tell me things that I'm actually going to be interested in about this home.
YOU1000000006_S0000021	And then last but not least, I'd like to wrap it up with a call to action to the landing page as well. Okay, so right here we've got an image of the exterior of the home.
YOU1000000006_S0000022	I like to have a one forward facing image and then if you want, this is optional. You don't have to, but you can add more images of the interior, but don't give them all the images.
YOU1000000006_S0000023	because you want to hold some of the images back so it gives them a reason to actually go through and opt in. So now what we're going to do is we're going to set this up.
YOU1000000006_S0000024	So that we're showing this to people in your specific community and then when they're scrolling through their Facebook or Instagram newsfeed on their mobile phone or on their desktop, whatever it is,
YOU1000000006_S0000025	They're going to come over here and like, oh man, this looks interesting. I want to check this home out. They'll click on this and then they'll go through, they'll put in their contact information.
YOU1000000006_S0000026	So their name, their email address, and their phone number, and they'll opt in and become a lead.
YOU1000000006_S0000027	Okay, so that's the whole process. I wanna show you now how to go through and actually set this up because it's nice to be able to go through and know, okay, I've got the Facebook ad copy template.
YOU1000000006_S0000028	I know I need to have a landing page, but how do I actually set that up? And how do I actually follow up with this lead? And how do I get all this stuff implemented, right?
YOU1000000006_S0000029	So, what I'm going to show you guys, this is a lead generation system and follow-up system that we build out specifically for real estate agents.
YOU1000000006_S0000030	to simplify the Facebook ad and Instagram ad creation process for you and not only the ad creation process but the follow-up process as well.
YOU1000000006_S0000031	So leveraging this in just three clicks, we can help you follow up via email, text message, Facebook message, and help you generate leads.
YOU1000000006_S0000032	and have those leads automatically book appointments with you. So I'm gonna show you guys how this is done. So let's say you wanna go through and market a listing.
YOU1000000006_S0000033	So we're gonna go through and click on the market a listing, okay, because that is this ad campaign template right here that's generating our clients on average 57 leads per month.
YOU1000000006_S0000034	So we generate over 40,000 real estate leads with this system showing you exactly the step-by-step process that all of our real estate clients do.
YOU1000000006_S0000035	Okay, so we're gonna give this a campaign name. So let's just say this is 456 Main Street, okay.
YOU1000000006_S0000037	So the address is 456 Main Street and this campaign name, this is for your eyes only. I just usually like to name it whatever I am naming.
YOU1000000006_S0000038	the or whatever the address is of the listing.
YOU1000000006_S0000039	And then let's say the price is $400,000.
YOU1000000006_S0000041	Okay, and this, we're filling this information out right here, and this is gonna automatically help us create the Facebook ad, the landing page.
YOU1000000006_S0000042	and the email and text messaging follow-ups for you. Okay, so you just put in a few details right here, it's gonna pre-create this ad.
YOU1000000006_S0000043	the landing page and all the fall for you case let me just show you guys this gate hold number bedroom to say is four bedrooms three bathrooms
YOU1000000006_S0000044	And it is in Salt Lake City. Okay, in the home description, this is where you spend a little bit more time. I'm not gonna spend a ton of time on this video,
YOU1000000006_S0000045	because I don't want you to have to watch me write all this stuff out. All right, so I just tied this out for you, but look at this. I put beautiful home with vaulted ceilings and a half acre lot with playground in the backyard for the kids.
YOU1000000006_S0000046	3 car garage for all your toys and tools and located near the best schools in the area with two amazing parks. Now if you look at that home description
YOU1000000006_S0000047	You can kind of get a feel of who I'm targeting. I'm targeting a family with kids, right? Beautiful home with half acre lot with playground in the backyard for the kids.
YOU1000000006_S0000048	3 car garage for the toys located near the best schools, 2 amazing parks. So if you're showing this to somebody in your area that has kids, these are all things that they're going to be interested in.
YOU1000000006_S0000049	And so that's going to even pick more interest for them to actually click on your ad and opt in to become a lead. So now we're just going to go through and throw in an image of the home. So I'm just going to grab that from my desktop.
YOU1000000006_S0000050	So just go like that, hit open, and then we're gonna click on next right there. And then look at this, this is super cool guys. It says where would you like the lead to go after opting in?
YOU1000000006_S0000051	So after they put in their name, phone number, email address onto your landing page, where would you like to send them? Would you like to send them to your Facebook page, your website?
YOU1000000006_S0000052	Book an appointment to a buyer Facebook messenger bot a seller messenger bot. Where would you like to send them? So for this example, I'm just going to say book an appointment
YOU1000000006_S0000053	because that honestly is kind of like the key to all this. We want people to book appointments with us, right?
YOU1000000006_S0000054	So it automatically populates with this link from your Facebook page and I'm going to show you guys here in just a second once we create this the whole process A to Z of what this looks like.
YOU1000000006_S0000055	So we're just going to click on next right here and then we're going to go through and set up our budget. So this is so that we can go through and create this for you.
YOU1000000006_S0000056	inside of the Facebook ad platform and put post this on Facebook and Instagram with all the targeting set up for you.
YOU1000000006_S0000057	and make it compliant with Facebook ads, special ad category for real estate agents and everything. Okay? So you go through, set a budget.
YOU1000000006_S0000058	$10 is kind of like what we recommend this goes directly to Facebook. Okay, so I'm just gonna click on I understand that I'm paying for this ad budget, right?
YOU1000000006_S0000059	And then target city, I'm gonna put in Salt Lake City. So Salt Lake City, Utah, right there.
YOU1000000006_S0000060	And then look at this, it's already pre-populated with everything that we need. New listing in the Salt Lake City area, four beds, three baths, exactly what we put in earlier.
YOU1000000006_S0000061	Okay, beautiful home with all the ceilings and half acre. So it's got everything that we've already put in Okay, and then you've got the ad preview over here

YOU1000000006_S0000069	At this point you get an instant lead notification on the arsenal mobile app that lets you know a newly opted in so you can call them immediately.
YOU1000000006_S0000070	And then if that lead responds back to one of the follow-up emails or text messages, you'll be able to follow up with them on the mobile app as well. But then look at this.
YOU1000000006_S0000071	Okay, you can go through and this will direct them to that appointment scheduling calendar.
YOU1000000006_S0000072	Just like we said to do in the campaign wizard setup process. Okay, so now at this point they come over here I'm like, oh man this weekend. I'm kind of busy

YOU1000000008_S0000001	So it's a Facebook Live tutorial with Facebook Live tips and other cool stuff. Cue the intro.
YOU1000000008_S0000003	Hey, it's Justin Brown here from Primal Video, where we help entrepreneurs and business owners amplify their business and their brand with video.
YOU1000000008_S0000004	If you're new here, then make sure you click that big subscribe button and all the links to everything we mention in this video, you'll find linked in the description box below. So let's jump into it.
YOU1000000008_S0000005	Facebook Live is an awesome tool for growing and engaging an audience. With some very simple tips and some very quick pre-live stream preparation, you can easily get professional results.
YOU1000000008_S0000006	So we're gonna run through seven steps to help you do just that.
YOU1000000008_S0000007	But as we're going through, don't get too excited with any one specific tip and jump off and try to implement it straight away.
YOU1000000008_S0000008	We're giving you a process here with tips along the way that you can implement for your next live stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000009	And I'm also gonna share my number one tool for getting more viewers on your shiny new professional looking Facebook live stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000010	And while we're going through, make sure you let us know in the comments what your number one tip is for maximizing results when going live on Facebook.
YOU1000000008_S0000011	Alright, so first off, before you go live, there's a few things that you need to do. Number one is to plan your content.
YOU1000000008_S0000012	So what you'll want for that is a simple structure of everything that you're going to cover, everything that you want to cover in your live stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000013	So your structure will have things like a hook, which is before the introduction. This is the thing that hooks your viewer to stick around for your live.
YOU1000000008_S0000014	You'll also then want an introduction, so talk about the things that you're gonna cover in the video. Then you can jump into the actual content itself.
YOU1000000008_S0000015	After you've delivered the content, be sure to have a recap or a summary to summarize everything that you've given them.
YOU1000000008_S0000016	and then a call to action, which is the next step that you want your viewers to take after your Facebook Live has finished.
YOU1000000008_S0000017	So that's a really simple structure, not just for your Facebook Lives, but also for your videos as well. Number two is to pick a location.
YOU1000000008_S0000018	Now you want to pick a location that matches your videos that you're actually creating. You want somewhere that's quiet, somewhere that's out of the way.
YOU1000000008_S0000019	You don't wanna be getting distracted or interrupted while you're actually live.
YOU1000000008_S0000020	you've all seen that video where a little kid walks in during a live stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000021	don't want that to happen for you. So try and pick somewhere out of the way, somewhere that is quiet with as little environmental variables as possible.
YOU1000000008_S0000022	So that's things like light changing outside or clouds coming over trucks or planes making a heap of noise.
YOU1000000008_S0000023	I'm gonna try and pick somewhere nice and quiet where you can just focus on delivering the content.
YOU1000000008_S0000024	You also wanna make sure that you're not picking a location that is distracting for your viewers. You want your viewers to focus on you and the content you're delivering, not being distracted with what's going on behind you.
YOU1000000008_S0000025	Step number three is to test your internet before you go live. It's a really good idea to at least have an understanding of how good or how bad your internet is.
YOU1000000008_S0000026	So, if you head over to speedtest.net or you can download the app for your iPhone or for your Android device and run a speed test for the internet connection that you're connected to.
YOU1000000008_S0000027	The most important thing that you're looking for here is that number one, that the internet you've got is stable and that that little speed test isn't bouncing around all over the place.
YOU1000000008_S0000028	but also you want to focus on your upload speed. So your upload speed is what's important here, not so much your download speed.
YOU1000000008_S0000029	and you wanna make sure that ideally you've got at least two to 2.5 megabits per second upload.
YOU1000000008_S0000030	If you've got 2 to 2.5 megabits per second upload, then that will be enough for Facebook Live. But you do need to be aware of other people that are sharing the same internet connection.
YOU1000000008_S0000031	if you're on an office wifi or work connection, other people may start downloading files and kill your internet for you.
YOU1000000008_S0000032	So you want to run a few tests, not just one. Run a few ideally 15 to 20 minutes before, then a few minutes out as well.
YOU1000000008_S0000033	so that you can really get an understanding of where your internet speed is at. Now if your internet speed is less than 2 to 2.5 megabits per second, then you've got two options.
YOU1000000008_S0000034	You can either try to find a different connection or a different location or to use LTE instead of Wi-Fi or use your mobile data.
YOU1000000008_S0000035	or you can still go live with the connection that you have, but just be aware that you might have some issues.
YOU1000000008_S0000036	And what I would do in that circumstance is if I'm gonna go live and I know that the internet speed isn't 100%.
YOU1000000008_S0000037	then one of the very first things I would do when I am live is to let my viewers know that we may be experiencing problems.
YOU1000000008_S0000038	because you're not sure how good the internet is in that location. So at least that expectation has been met in case there's any issues with your stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000039	Then obviously then if you're running your speed test and you've got higher than 2.5 megabits per second upload, then you shouldn't have any issues at all.
YOU1000000008_S0000040	Step number four is to get everything set up. So this means setting up your camera, setting up your tripod if you're gonna be using a tripod.
YOU1000000008_S0000041	Make sure everything is stable, everything is at the correct height, that you've got your audio and your light and everything set up ready to go for your Facebook live stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000042	Now obviously this is gonna depend if you're using a camera, if you're using your phone, or if you're just using your laptop and a webcam to go live.
YOU1000000008_S0000043	and there is obviously different recommended gear for the different scenarios.
YOU1000000008_S0000044	but I will link up in the cards now to some of our recommended gear for going live on Facebook Live from your smartphone.
YOU1000000008_S0000045	Simple things like having a portable microphone and a mini tripod so that you're getting the phone out of your hands.
YOU1000000008_S0000046	and into a stable position. And that's really important no matter what type of video or live you're creating. Get your phone or your camera out of your hands and get it somewhere stable.
YOU1000000008_S0000047	Use a tripod if you can, or just position your camera somewhere where it's not gonna shake and move around a lot for your lives.
YOU1000000008_S0000048	Now if you're using a Mac or a PC to go live, you can use similar gear as well. And you can either just use your Facebook browser to go live,
YOU1000000008_S0000049	or you can use software like Ecamm or XSplit, Vmix, OBS, Wirecast. There is a heap of options out there for Facebook Live.
YOU1000000008_S0000050	I've actually got another video that we've just released and I'll link that up in the cards as well, covering off a heap of different options for going live on Facebook.
YOU1000000008_S0000051	But no matter which way you're going live, the important thing is to make sure that everything is set up correctly and how you want it, with as much or as little gear as you have before you go live.
YOU1000000008_S0000052	You don't wanna be tweaking and changing things while you're live. And that leads us right into step number five, which is to do a test broadcast.
YOU1000000008_S0000053	So this is where once you've got everything sorted, press the live button, but make sure that the live broadcast is only going to just you, or that it's a private live.
YOU1000000008_S0000054	So in the Facebook settings, you get to choose who you want to broadcast to, and there is an option there to broadcast to only me, or just yourself.
YOU1000000008_S0000055	So that way there's no one else that will see it. So what you're looking for in this test is that everything looks good, sounds good, and that everything is set up the way that you'd like it.
YOU1000000008_S0000056	Now if you are going live in a sales scenario or you're doing this for a live promotion,
YOU1000000008_S0000057	And I would also suggest that while you're running this live, that you do a quick run through of the content that you're gonna be presenting as well.
YOU1000000008_S0000058	So that way, you'll feel more relaxed, because you've had a run through, but also when you're watching back, you can give yourself some feedback on how you went in your live test.
YOU1000000008_S0000059	6. Tell people you're about to go live. This can be as simple as sending out a tweet, Instagram post or Facebook to let people know
YOU1000000008_S0000060	but there is also a really cool way to automatically post and email as soon as you go live with a cool app called Live Leap. So I'm gonna cover that off in a few minutes.
YOU1000000008_S0000061	but there are some ways to automate that process as well. And step number seven is to go live. So the first thing you do when you go live should be to deliver the hook.
YOU1000000008_S0000062	Start talking to people as if you're delivering the content and the video structure that you had planned out. Don't stop to welcome everybody in and start some idle chit chat with people.
YOU1000000008_S0000063	because that won't fly for the people that are watching the replay. They're going to lose that connection with you. So focus on the hook and then get straight into the content beyond that.
YOU1000000008_S0000064	While you're live, you also wanna make sure that you are making eye contact directly with your viewers, which means looking at the camera lens.
YOU1000000008_S0000065	not looking off to the side, your viewers will be able to notice if you're not looking and talking directly to them.
YOU1000000008_S0000066	So you wanna make sure that you're looking directly down your camera lens so that you're making that eye contact and that deep connection with your viewers.
YOU1000000008_S0000067	Now it's likely that while you're live, you'll also wanna interact with your audience.
YOU1000000008_S0000068	but it's really important here to try and batch all your live interactions into certain areas of your live stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000069	you definitely don't wanna break the content that you're delivering or the key teachings and learnings for your viewers with you.
YOU1000000008_S0000070	dropping off and saying hi to someone as they come in, or answering a comment immediately. So for some live streams, it could be that you break every few minutes throughout.
YOU1000000008_S0000071	Or in some cases you might want to save it all until the end of your video to do some interacting or some live Q&A.
YOU1000000008_S0000072	However you decide to do it, make sure you let your viewers know how it's going to work and when you're gonna be answering their questions and when you're gonna be covering off the content as well.
YOU1000000008_S0000073	and also be aware of anything that changes audio-wise in your live stream as well.
YOU1000000008_S0000074	So if you are filming outside and a big truck pulled up next to you, then you might be able to pick up and move to another location while you're still live and presenting and interacting.
YOU1000000008_S0000075	so that your viewers can actually still hear what you're saying instead of having it drowned out by a truck or some other noise.
YOU1000000008_S0000076	And the last thing to remember while you're live is to have fun with your live stream.
YOU1000000008_S0000077	If you're not having fun, then it's going to be very difficult for your viewers to engage with you and have fun as well. So it all comes down to you. Have fun with your live streams and your viewers will enjoy it too.
YOU1000000008_S0000078	Now I did mention Live Leap a few minutes ago.
YOU1000000008_S0000079	So what LiveLeap is, is it's this amazing tool that lets you automatically share out your Facebook Lives the instant that you go live on Facebook Live.
YOU1000000008_S0000080	and it will let you share them out to your website, it'll let you share them out through email, through social media, and to multiple Facebook pages and Facebook groups as well.
YOU1000000008_S0000081	So an amazing tool to automate all of that. So you just need to focus on pressing the go live button instead of sitting there sharing everything out the moment that you go live.
YOU1000000008_S0000082	One of the biggest things that I hate to watch on a Facebook Live is you join, you're the first one to join or you join immediately when the Facebook Live happens.
YOU1000000008_S0000083	and they make you wait. They say, oh yeah, we'll start in a minute. I'm just going to share this out. Live Leap does that for you so that you don't need to worry about it.
YOU1000000008_S0000084	So if you're interested in automating that process for your Facebook live streams, then definitely check out Live Leap and there'll be a link in the description box below.
YOU1000000008_S0000085	Now if you're interested in taking your Facebook live streams up another level, adding things like titles, multiple cameras, effects, multiple people.
YOU1000000008_S0000086	then check out the video linked on screen now covering the best Facebook Live software for Mac and PC. And I'll see you soon.
YOU1000000012_S0000000	Are you ready to up your Facebook Live game with software for your Mac or PC? Then here's our take on the best Facebook Live streaming software available right now to help you decide.
YOU1000000012_S0000002	Hey, it's Justin Brown here from Primal Video. We release a ton of content to help you get better results with your videos faster.
YOU1000000012_S0000003	If you're new here, then make sure you click that subscribe button and all the links to everything you mention in this video, you can find linked in the description box below. So let's jump into it.
YOU1000000012_S0000004	Now there's a lot of Facebook Live software options available out there and we've reviewed a bunch of them individually in the past. We've also played around with a lot of other ones as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000005	The landscape though is always changing with constant updates, so in this video we put all the major players head to head, comparing the pros and the cons,
YOU1000000012_S0000006	to help you decide which is the best for your Facebook live streams. So whether it's multi-person interviews, live screen sharing or on-screen chat,
YOU1000000012_S0000007	or just fancy branding or animations, third-party Facebook Live software can unlock a huge range of functionality that you just can't get with Facebook standard apps.
YOU1000000012_S0000008	So in this video, we're going to tackle my top solutions for the most popular types of Facebook live streams, including two person, more than two person,
YOU1000000012_S0000009	and live with screen sharing capabilities. And make sure you stick around to the end, because I'm also going to give you my number one tip for automatically sharing your Facebook Live links.
YOU1000000012_S0000010	to get more of your audience onto your live streams the moment you go live. So these are in no particular order and they range in price from $3 to $695.
YOU1000000012_S0000011	What's best for you will depend on what you're looking to achieve, the platforms and devices you're using, and your budget. So make sure you stick around to hear the full six.
YOU1000000012_S0000012	so that you don't miss out. So straight off the bat, the first one that we need to mention is the Facebook website.
YOU1000000012_S0000013	The easiest way to go live in a lot of cases is just to use the Facebook website with your webcam. Choose to create a new post and click live.
YOU1000000012_S0000014	and then you're broadcasting live directly from your laptop or computer with just your webcam. So it's probably the easiest way to go live.
YOU1000000012_S0000015	from your desktop without the need for any other software or platform. So the biggest advantage with this is that you don't need anything else. You're not paying for any subscriptions.
YOU1000000012_S0000016	You've literally got all that you need in the Facebook website. And with the recent update, you can now share your computer screen on your Facebook Lives just using the Facebook website as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000017	So the biggest disadvantages then is that you don't have any advanced control. So you don't have the ability to bring anyone else in or to really do anything fancy with your live streaming on Facebook.
YOU1000000012_S0000018	Option number two is to use live broadcasting or live streaming software like OBS or open broadcaster software and Wirecast Studio.
YOU1000000012_S0000019	Now both of these are fairly complex solutions. These will give you a professional range of tools for creating professional looking live streams.
YOU1000000012_S0000020	things like being able to bring in multiple camera angles and seamlessly switch between them to have multiple screen shares.
YOU1000000012_S0000021	to really have a full range of control and customizability over your live streams. We have done a full comparison of OBS and comparing it to Wirecast.
YOU1000000012_S0000022	and I'll link that up in the cards now if you're interested in that. But one of the major differences between the two is the price. OBS, which runs on Mac, PC, and Linux, is free, 100% free.
YOU1000000012_S0000023	Wirecast Studio on the other hand, which runs on both Mac and PC, currently sells for $695, which is just actually have a decent price increase from $495.
YOU1000000012_S0000024	The biggest difference though between the two is the level of control and customizability, and also the ease of use.
YOU1000000012_S0000025	Wirecast at that price point is much, much easier to set up and use. And that's actually one of my go-to solutions for professional live streams.
YOU1000000012_S0000026	is what we use for all our client projects. In the latest update though from Wirecast, where they got their price increase as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000027	they've actually announced a really decent feature, a really cool feature which lets you bring in guests to interview them live seamlessly using the Wirecast software.
YOU1000000012_S0000028	So it would be similar to bringing someone in on a Skype call so that you can bring someone in and interview them and go live through Wirecast as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000029	Now you can do a similar sort of thing with OBS and bring in guests using applications like Skype and screen sharing that Skype call, but it can get pretty complicated and pretty messy.
YOU1000000012_S0000030	especially when you're trying to sort out your audio issues and removing echo and yeah, it's possible but it's definitely complicated and that's probably the biggest thing with these two.
YOU1000000012_S0000031	they're not for the faint-hearted. You definitely need to invest some time into OBS or Wirecast to get up to speed because you've got so much control over your live streams in there.
YOU1000000012_S0000032	But both of these will not only let you broadcast to Facebook Live, they'll both let you also broadcast to other live streaming platforms like YouTube Live, Twitch, Periscope, and a heap of others out there as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000033	So both great solutions if you want a really professional looking live stream with multiple cameras and yeah, complicated setups.
YOU1000000012_S0000034	Solution number three is a piece of software called Ecamm Live. Now Ecamm Live will work on Mac only and you can pick it up for $29.99.
YOU1000000012_S0000035	So crazy cheap, especially when you're comparing it to Wirecast at $695.
YOU1000000012_S0000036	So what Ecamm Live will let you do is broadcast live currently just to Facebook Live, but they have announced that they will have RTMP
YOU1000000012_S0000037	or opening up their broadcasting capabilities to other streaming platforms like YouTube, Periscope, and others as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000038	very, very soon. They've also just announced that they're going to be integrating Skype into Ecamm Live as well. So you will have that ability to use Skype.
YOU1000000012_S0000039	to make calls and live interviews without all the headaches that you can have using Wirecast and OBS. So that is an amazing feature.
YOU1000000012_S0000040	and it's crazy that you're getting all of this for under $30. It's actually one of the most complete ways or most polished ways to go live on Facebook Live.
YOU1000000012_S0000041	and to be able to see and monitor all your interactions and hearts and comments and things as you're live that you would normally get on the Facebook Live mobile app, to go live from the app.
YOU1000000012_S0000042	So it is amazing that you get this in a desktop app again. It's currently Mac only Hopefully somewhere in the future. They'll also release a PC version
YOU1000000012_S0000043	but if you're on Mac, this piece of software is an absolute no-brainer. Ecamm Live also lets you easily share your computer screen or playback videos as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000044	So if you've got videos queued up that you wanna play in your live stream, with the click of a button, you can be playing those out. And it also supports local disc recording as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000045	So whatever you're broadcasting live, you're also saving that live stream to your computer with a one-click upload to YouTube once you've finished your Facebook live stream.
YOU1000000012_S0000046	So that's pretty cool. Solution number four is a really popular web platform called Beelive. So the website's Beelive.tv.
YOU1000000012_S0000047	So what this lets you do is run everything from your web browser so you don't need to download any software or install anything, which means that you can use this on pretty much any computer.
YOU1000000012_S0000048	It seamlessly connects through to any webcam or microphone that you've got set up and running on your computer, but also makes it really, really easy for you to bring guests into your live stream.
YOU1000000012_S0000049	So no one needs to download or install any software. You literally just send out the link. People can join a waiting room where you can see while you're live that they're there waiting.
YOU1000000012_S0000050	and you can invite them on. So you're not limited to just bringing one guest on, you can actually have two guests on. So three people live on your Facebook live stream currently.
YOU1000000012_S0000051	You also get some amazing control over your Facebook live stream. So once again, you get to see from the Be.Live interface all your Facebook comments.
YOU1000000012_S0000052	You have to see how many people are watching. You can actually promote or feature comments on your live stream.
YOU1000000012_S0000053	So all you have to do is when someone's made a comment that you wanna feature or promote, you click on it and it will be made big on the live stream for everyone to see.
YOU1000000012_S0000054	So that's an amazing feature, especially if you're gonna be doing live Q&As with your audience, you can bring up the question or the comment that you're going to be addressing.
YOU1000000012_S0000055	So really cool feature and it's so easy to use. This is probably the easiest app out of all the ones we've mentioned and going to be mentioning.
YOU1000000012_S0000056	Besides number one the Facebook website itself. This is the easiest one to use. It's the most intuitive interface It's really for anyone beginner through to advanced
YOU1000000012_S0000057	B-Live also lets you share your computer screen easily as well. There's also templates that are set up or presets that are set up in B-Live.
YOU1000000012_S0000058	So when you clip them, you can change what the view or the display is like for your viewers.
YOU1000000012_S0000059	So with the click of a button you can switch between a full screen view of yourself to a 50-50 screen split with yourself and someone that you've got on your live stream.
YOU1000000012_S0000060	or you can easily split to a three-way split where you've got three people side by side. So not only is this an amazing platform for going live,
YOU1000000012_S0000061	It's also really amazing how easy it is to use. To set up something like this in OBS or in Wirecast would take a huge amount of time to set up.
YOU1000000012_S0000062	but also to manage while you're live. Now there's four pricing options for Be.Live.TV. There is a free plan, which gives you 20 minutes free broadcasting twice a week.
YOU1000000012_S0000063	There's a light plan for $12 per month which lets you do things like add a custom logo, branded colours and you've got a limit of 16 broadcasts per month.
YOU1000000012_S0000064	Then above that you've got your standard package which is $20 per month. In here the biggest difference is that it's unlimited broadcast per month.
YOU1000000012_S0000065	and you also get access to the advanced features like screen sharing, custom branded frames, and also early access to new features as they become available.
YOU1000000012_S0000066	And the other plan above that is the enterprise plan, which at $500 per month is probably going to rule this out for a lot of people here.
YOU1000000012_S0000067	with the additional features listed as telephone support, custom graphics, and custom formats as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000068	So I would imagine for most people, the light plan or the standard plan will be what you're after.
YOU1000000012_S0000069	Number five is Zoom. Now Zoom is another online platform, but this one has the big advantage of being able to bring in a heap of guests into your live streams.
YOU1000000012_S0000070	Live streaming to Facebook and YouTube from Zoom is actually a relatively new feature that they've added. It did start out as video conferencing software and now they've brought in some more webinar style tools as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000071	which obviously let you go live on places like Facebook and YouTube. In Zoom you get a heap of advanced controls over
YOU1000000012_S0000072	the people that you're bringing into your call, whether it's just you and you've got other people as guests or whether you want to bring other people in as panelists or co-hosts.
YOU1000000012_S0000073	whether their webcams are on by default or muted or you can control all of that while you're live as well. It's also got built-in polling, it's got a built-in chat window,
YOU1000000012_S0000074	so you can interact with your audience while you're live from withinside the Zoom call as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000075	One of the big advantages with Zoom is how easy it is to create the live call or the live link and get that sent out to your participants or guests that are gonna be on the call.
YOU1000000012_S0000076	to have the call automatically scheduled and entered into your calendar. So there's a heap of really professional functionality and reminders that are built in.
YOU1000000012_S0000077	all around scheduling the call and making sure that your guests are there and in the right place, and also helping them test their audio and their webcam as they join the call.
YOU1000000012_S0000078	to make sure that everything is working. And one of the other really powerful features of Zoom is not only does it let you record your.
YOU1000000012_S0000079	call or your live directly to your local computer, but it also gives you the ability to record your calls and save them in the cloud as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000080	And when you enable the cloud recording, it actually records two files for you. It records the speaker view, which is the default view.
YOU1000000012_S0000081	which changes based on whoever is talking. So it's a full screen version of whoever is speaking and switches automatically. But it also gives you the gallery view as well.
YOU1000000012_S0000082	So if you've got a few people on there, then it will show everyone on the screen for that recording. So to have that ability that you're able to record in two separate files.
YOU1000000012_S0000083	the two different camera views is amazing. So in regards to pricing, in order to use Zoom for live streaming, you need to be on their pro plan, which costs $14.99 per month.
YOU1000000012_S0000084	But you're also gonna need to add the webinar add-on to actually go live, which costs an additional $40 per month.
YOU1000000012_S0000085	So in order to go live on Facebook with Zoom, you will be spending $55 per month.
YOU1000000012_S0000086	6. Crowdcast
YOU1000000012_S0000087	so you can ask questions to your people watching and see the results in real time. They'll both have chat, they'll both handle questions, but Crowdcast is probably a more polished solution, at least for webinars anyway.
YOU1000000012_S0000088	What you get in Crowdcast though after your live stream is some really advanced detail and analytics about the people that were there.
YOU1000000012_S0000089	how long they stayed for, where they came in from. So the level of analytics and data that you're able to capture in Crowdcast is pretty amazing.
YOU1000000012_S0000090	Crowdcast also has integration with Zapier and with Drip, meaning you can get some great data and analytics through from your live calls into your CRM, which is a really cool feature.
YOU1000000012_S0000091	Crowdcast also has a multi-stream feature, which is actually what you'll need to be able to broadcast your Crowdcast call or meeting onto Facebook Live.
YOU1000000012_S0000092	But this multi-stream feature will also let you broadcast to multiple live platforms as well. So whether that's multiple Facebook Live pages, accounts, groups, events, or you could broadcast live to Facebook and YouTube at the same time.
YOU1000000012_S0000093	In regards to pricing, Crowdcast has three pricing options.
YOU1000000012_S0000094	The first is their light package at $49 per month. Then they've got a professional package at $89 per month. And that's actually the one that you're going to need.
YOU1000000012_S0000095	if you wanna be doing lives to Facebook Live or YouTube Live. And there's also a business plan as well for $195 per month.
YOU1000000012_S0000096	So it's definitely not on the cheaper end of things. So the main difference when you're comparing the professional package to the business package is the number of live attendees.
YOU1000000012_S0000097	goes from 250 up to 500 and the cost for an extra live attendee goes from 30 cents down to 15 cents on the business plan.
YOU1000000012_S0000098	But keep in mind that these numbers for attendees aren't in relation to Facebook Live. This is only for people that are attending your call or your webinar on the actual platform.
YOU1000000012_S0000099	If you're going to be using this for Facebook Live, which is what we're talking about in this video, then there may not be anyone that's actually attending on the actual platform.
YOU1000000012_S0000100	They'll be watching and interacting with you through Facebook Live. So if all you're interested in is using Crowdcast for Facebook Lives, then you'll definitely be able to get away with the professional plan.
YOU1000000012_S0000101	So those are our top six solutions for creating awesome Facebook Lives, whether it's bringing in screen share, bringing in one guest, two guests, or a heap of guests into your live streams.
YOU1000000012_S0000102	Now as we said, there was a huge range in price, there's also a huge range in features and capabilities for the different solutions.
YOU1000000012_S0000103	Now before we get to my number one tip to automatically getting more of your audience on your live stream as soon as you go live, let's do a quick recap of the options.
YOU1000000012_S0000104	and who I'd recommend each for. So if you just wanna go live on Facebook the simplest and easiest way with no additional guests, then you can just use the Facebook website.
YOU1000000012_S0000105	If you're after the most amount of control for your live streams and you want to bring in multiple screen shares, multiple cameras and guests and things as well,
YOU1000000012_S0000106	then you can look at OBS or Wirecast as a professional solution there. If you're on a Mac and you're looking for a really cheap and easy way to create a professional live stream,
YOU1000000012_S0000107	where you get the full interaction with Facebook comments and interactions, then check out Ecamm Live.
YOU1000000012_S0000108	If you're looking for a really easy way to do a two-person live, a three-person live, and again, be able to monitor the comments and feature your comments, then Be.Live.TV might be the answer for you.
YOU1000000012_S0000109	And if you want to do a Facebook Live with two people, three people, four people, or a lot more, then you can look at something like Zoom, which is a cheap alternative to Crowdcast, which will also let you do the same thing.
YOU1000000012_S0000110	but it's also going to give you more analytics and integrations with things like Zapier.
YOU1000000012_S0000111	So now for my tip to help you get more of your audience onto your Facebook Lives automatically, the solution is to use Live Leap.
YOU1000000012_S0000112	Now LiveLeap is a service that helps you automatically share out your Facebook Lives automatically the moment that you go live.
YOU1000000012_S0000113	So whether you're going live to a Facebook page, a group, or an event, it's automatically going to share it out to your audience on whatever pages, groups, Twitter even.
YOU1000000012_S0000114	or even put a link on your website saying that you're currently live on Facebook. So this is something if you're serious about doing Facebook Lives that I can't recommend strongly enough.
YOU1000000012_S0000115	It is the easiest way to automatically share out your lives the moment that you go live without you needing to do anything across a heap of different social platforms.
YOU1000000012_S0000116	including your website. So I'll put a link down in the description below if you want to check out LiveLeap.
YOU1000000012_S0000117	Now if you're going live on Facebook from your smartphone, there are some simple, low-cost gear that can help you get much better results.
YOU1000000012_S0000118	Check out the video linked on screen now for the best Facebook Live gear for both iPhone and Android. I'll see you soon.
YOU1000000016_S0000000	In this video we're going to run through exactly how to live stream to multiple platforms at the same time or how to simulcast.
YOU1000000016_S0000001	whether it's to YouTube Live, Facebook Live, Twitch, or almost any other platform, we've got you covered in this video.
YOU1000000016_S0000003	Hey, it's Justin Brown here from Primal Video, where we help you amplify your business and brand with video.
YOU1000000016_S0000004	If you're new here, make sure you click that subscribe button and all the links to everything we mention in this video, you can find linked in the description box below.
YOU1000000016_S0000005	So let's jump into it. Now with some simple tools these days, it's really easy to live stream to multiple platforms. In fact, there's even a name for it and it's called Simulcasting.
YOU1000000016_S0000006	So that means you can easily create one live stream and push it out to multiple live platforms.
YOU1000000016_S0000007	or streaming sources like Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Twitch and a ton of other platforms as well.
YOU1000000016_S0000008	Now we actually did a video on this topic a little while back, but since then so much has changed and it's now become so much easier to be able to do this.
YOU1000000016_S0000009	So I thought it was time to update that video and run through the new best ways to do this or the new options to be able to do this.
YOU1000000016_S0000010	And while we're going through, I want to hear from you guys, what social or content platforms are you most active on when it comes to live streaming?
YOU1000000016_S0000011	We're gonna start to pick up our game a little bit on the YouTube live side of things, but we may look at other platforms too, thanks to simulcasting.
YOU1000000016_S0000012	Now you've really got two main options when it comes to live streaming to multiple platforms.
YOU1000000016_S0000013	The first one is to push out multiple streams from your broadcasting software. Now this is really only possible in software like vMix or like Wirecast.
YOU1000000016_S0000014	where you're able to set up multiple output sources. So instead of just sending your live stream feed to YouTube, you're also able to add in an additional stream
YOU1000000016_S0000015	for Facebook or for Twitch or wherever else you'd like to broadcast to.
YOU1000000016_S0000016	So that was pretty much what we covered the first time we tackled this and I'll put a link up to that video because that method still does work.
YOU1000000016_S0000017	But the biggest downside with that is that you're actually pushing those multiple streams from your one computer and from your one internet connection.
YOU1000000016_S0000018	which means it can put your computer under load, but it also can put your internet bandwidth under load.
YOU1000000016_S0000019	So if you are going to be pushing multiple streams, you will need at least twice the available bandwidth.
YOU1000000016_S0000020	or if you're running three streams, you'll need three times the bandwidth that you would for one stream across each of the individual streams to be able to push them all out.
YOU1000000016_S0000021	The other big downside of multicasting that way was the interactions or the comments. They were all separate. There was no way to pull them all together.
YOU1000000016_S0000022	so that you can bring in comments from YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook all into one chat window for you running the stream to be able to monitor them in one place.
YOU1000000016_S0000023	you literally had to go to Facebook and then over to Twitch and over to YouTube to be able to see each one of those different comment feeds.
YOU1000000016_S0000024	So while all of that was doable, it was a pain to set up and it could be rather frustrating to manage and see everything while you're actually live.
YOU1000000016_S0000025	But the option that I'm about to show you now, option number two, will require no additional bandwidth, will put your computer under no additional load, and you'll be able to use a larger range of live streaming software.
YOU1000000016_S0000026	or platforms to be able to do this.
YOU1000000016_S0000027	So what I'm talking about here is a multicast or simulcast platform that you send your live stream to them and they push it out to the different platforms for you.
YOU1000000016_S0000028	Now there are quite a few platforms out there that offer this service of rebroadcasting and redistributing your content out for you.
YOU1000000016_S0000029	And in there you've got a massive range from super basic right up to enterprise grade. And obviously the enterprise grade ones are gonna come with the enterprise price tag.
YOU1000000016_S0000030	So there's really three main options when it comes to those of us that are looking just to push our live streams out to multiple places without the need for enterprise stuff.
YOU1000000016_S0000031	and the three most popular and my top three are Restream, Switchboard and Caster.
YOU1000000016_S0000032	Now all three of these make it really simple to push your live stream out to multiple sources at the same time.
YOU1000000016_S0000033	So they all support things like YouTube live, Facebook live, Twitch, all the popular ones. And they also have RTMP. So you can really push your live stream out to anywhere.
YOU1000000016_S0000034	using that RTMP protocol.
YOU1000000016_S0000035	They also all have integrated comments or integrated chat, meaning that no matter which services you're broadcasting to, you can pull in the chat to one central location.
YOU1000000016_S0000036	making it easy for you to either bring those comments and those chat elements up on screen in your live stream or just to make it easy for you to monitor.
YOU1000000016_S0000037	and interact with people while you're live. And all three of those also have global servers where you can manually pick the fastest servers or the service closest to you.
YOU1000000016_S0000038	to rebroadcast out your live stream with the lowest latency. Meaning that it's not gonna add a delay or a big delay to your live stream for those watching on the different platforms.
YOU1000000016_S0000039	it's really going to be almost instant if you're picking a server that is close to your location.
YOU1000000016_S0000040	Now it's also important to note that Facebook Live is actually treated a little different. It's treated separately from pretty much all the other broadcast platforms out there. And you'll see that when we get to the pricing options.
YOU1000000016_S0000041	of these services and how they treat Facebook, but it's all to do with the way that Facebook actually lets you broadcast live to them.
YOU1000000016_S0000042	And in some of these cases, you're going to have to pay a little bit extra or a lot more to be able to broadcast to Facebook or to multiple Facebook locations.
YOU1000000016_S0000043	Now I'm going to quickly run through some of the standout pros and cons for each of these three, for Switchboard, for Restream and for Casta, to help you better decide which one is going to be the pick for you.
YOU1000000016_S0000044	but this really isn't a full comprehensive review or feature comparison of the three. This is just the standout pros and cons as far as I'm concerned
YOU1000000016_S0000045	to really help you narrow down which one of these is gonna be the best fit for you.
YOU1000000016_S0000046	Alright, so Restream or Restream.io is probably the most popular and most people's go-to platform for multicasting or getting their live stream out to multiple places.
YOU1000000016_S0000047	It is by far the most feature rich, but it's also probably the most unintuitive or the hardest to use.
YOU1000000016_S0000048	It's got the most advanced control in regards to the chat or the comment feeds.
YOU1000000016_S0000049	and it's also got API integration so that it's really easy to integrate that chat role into your live streaming software like Wirecast and OBS.
YOU1000000016_S0000050	It also has built-in live transcoding, which means that you can transcode or convert your live streaming to different formats, different qualities, different sizes.
YOU1000000016_S0000051	while you're live to match different platforms that you might be broadcasting live to.
YOU1000000016_S0000052	And another great feature is that Restream don't limit the amount of bandwidth or the bitrate or the quality of your live streams coming in or out of their service.
YOU1000000016_S0000053	They also make it really easy to resize those different versions. So if you're broadcasting a widescreen video and you want to convert it in Restream,
YOU1000000016_S0000054	so that your Facebook version is going out in portrait, they make that really easy as well.
YOU1000000016_S0000055	There's really two main downsides to Restream. The first one I touched on already, it's around having all of these extra features, but the actual interface isn't super intuitive.
YOU1000000016_S0000056	or it's not easy to find everything and it can get overwhelming and complicated to go through and just create some simple restreams.
YOU1000000016_S0000057	So it's really for probably the more advanced side of things.
YOU1000000016_S0000058	The second one is that they add their branding to your live streams up until you reach their pro plan.
YOU1000000016_S0000059	And so on their pro plan, they'll let you remove their branding.
YOU1000000016_S0000060	Now it's not just the branding inside of your live streams, like a watermark on it.
YOU1000000016_S0000061	it's actually into your social media streams as well. So in Restream, you can set it up so that when you're live, it'll tweet out and maybe do a Facebook post out.
YOU1000000016_S0000062	but in there it's actually it's got their branding in it. It's got mentions of them and tags them in your post. So I think for anyone that's using this on the business side,
YOU1000000016_S0000063	You definitely don't want to have that going on, which means that you're going to need to start at the pro plan.
YOU1000000016_S0000064	So it's not a deal breaker, but it just means that you've got to be using that pro plan to get rid of all of that branding.
YOU1000000016_S0000065	Now when it comes to pricing, they've split this off into two. So you've got individual pricing plans and you've got company pricing plans.
YOU1000000016_S0000066	There is a free plan that lets you broadcast your stream out to 30 plus streaming platforms.
YOU1000000016_S0000067	but that doesn't include Facebook. There's also a standard plan at $16 per month, and that gives you access to livestream to one Facebook channel.
YOU1000000016_S0000068	It also gives it the ability in real time to switch or toggle between or on or off the different live streaming platforms.
YOU1000000016_S0000069	And then you've got the professional plan, which is $41 per month. This will give you access to three Facebook channels, and also it takes the branding off as well.
YOU1000000016_S0000070	Now the transcoding that I mentioned just before is an additional $2 per hour for the length of your live stream.
YOU1000000016_S0000071	Now, up from that, they do have premium business and enterprise plans available as well.
YOU1000000016_S0000072	And this gives you access to five Facebook channels on the premium and 15 Facebook channels on the business. And obviously the enterprise one is for those that are really crazy serious above and beyond that point.
YOU1000000016_S0000073	The next option you've got is Switchboard or switchboard.live. Now this is another really awesome platform to be able to multicast your live streams out.
YOU1000000016_S0000074	They've got a really intuitive, really easy to use interface. It's so easy to quickly jump in.
YOU1000000016_S0000075	link up your channels, your Facebook pages, and those sorts of things, and start to broadcast out from there.
YOU1000000016_S0000076	Once again, they've got really great chat integration, not quite to the level that you get in Restream, but still really solid and still they make it pretty easy to get it into your live streaming programs as well.
YOU1000000016_S0000077	And you've also got transcoding capabilities again to push the different versions for different platforms. But one of the cool features that you've got inside of Switchboard is
YOU1000000016_S0000078	that for each one of the broadcasters that you have or each one of the platforms that you're broadcasting to, you can totally customize them up.
YOU1000000016_S0000079	to have even individual branding. So your Facebook live stream could have different branding to your YouTube live stream, which has totally different branding to your Twitch live stream.
YOU1000000016_S0000080	So even while the content that you're broadcasting out from your computer is the same, you've got a different version or different logos and those sorts of things on each of them.
YOU1000000016_S0000081	all managed through switchboard. Even little things like being able to bulk start and stop streams and multiple streams is just so easy to do inside of switchboard. So they make a lot of this stuff really, really easy.
YOU1000000016_S0000082	So now in regards to the downsides of switchboard, I think most of these are really based around their pricing models and
YOU1000000016_S0000083	and the restrictions that come in at the different pricing models. So first off there's no free option but there is a $99 per month professional plan.
YOU1000000016_S0000084	and that's actually their lowest entry level plan. Now they do have a 14 day trial available.
YOU1000000016_S0000085	but on that plan your live streams are going to be restricted to 5 megabits per second and at a maximum resolution of 1080p.
YOU1000000016_S0000086	but they'll let you broadcast out simultaneously to five providers and two of those include Facebook.
YOU1000000016_S0000087	Now they also have restrictions around the duration of your live streams and your multicast as well.
YOU1000000016_S0000088	On that professional plan you're limited to 50 hours per month.
YOU1000000016_S0000089	and 12 hours per live stream. Now depending on the type and the amount of live streaming that you're actually doing, none of those may come into effect.
YOU1000000016_S0000090	or may affect you too much. But they do have two other plans listed on their website for business and for enterprise, but neither one of them has pricing available.
YOU1000000016_S0000091	So you need to reach out if you're interested in pricing for those but obviously with those a lot of those restrictions
YOU1000000016_S0000092	have been moved or raised.
YOU1000000016_S0000093	So now for the third option which was Casta or casta.io. Now this is probably the new kid on the block.
YOU1000000016_S0000094	And it's actually probably the most compelling offer as well, and the one that I'm the most excited about. There you go. I'll just spoil the rest of the video for you.
YOU1000000016_S0000095	but this is the one that I think is going to be the game changer going forward and could really have a big impact.
YOU1000000016_S0000096	on the other two options moving forward. Now, Casta, once again, is really easy to use.
YOU1000000016_S0000097	But I think the biggest reason that Casta is super easy to use is that it's not filled with all the additional features and bells and whistles.
YOU1000000016_S0000098	as the other two that we've seen. Now there's no ads, there's no bandwidth limitations, and there's no stream time or limits.
YOU1000000016_S0000099	on how long you can actually broadcast for. They even say on their website that you could stream 24-7 through their platform if you wanted to.
YOU1000000016_S0000100	Another big feature that Casta has is the ability to do cloud recording. So you can actually do a full recording of whatever it is you're live streaming
YOU1000000016_S0000101	without needing to save it locally on your computer.
YOU1000000016_S0000102	And just like the other two, it does have integrated chat as well.
YOU1000000016_S0000103	and they even show you on their website how to bring it into places like Wirecast.
YOU1000000016_S0000104	Now what Casta doesn't have, straight out of the box anyway, is those transcoding and reformatting options that you had in Restream and in Switchboard.
YOU1000000016_S0000105	but they do have another service offering that ties in with Casta that does give you access to all of those things if you need them.
YOU1000000016_S0000106	So now looking at the pricing options, I think this is really where Casta shines. They have a free plan with no branding, no watermarks.
YOU1000000016_S0000107	No restrictions around bandwidth or the amount of time you can live stream for. Totally free. That will let you share that out to five publishing locations.
YOU1000000016_S0000108	including one Facebook channel. They also have a $9.99 per month plan which gives you up to 10 publishing locations.
YOU1000000016_S0000109	and two Facebook channels and for $29.99 you'll get unlimited locations and five Facebook channels.
YOU1000000016_S0000110	Now, like I said at the start of the video, we're not getting into the nitty gritty of each of these three platforms. We are specifically looking at
YOU1000000016_S0000111	multi casting and broadcasting your live stream out to multiple platforms. These are, in my opinion, the best three to do that. And you can also see.
YOU1000000016_S0000112	that they're also completely different offerings. Now if you're someone who's on the more advanced side of things and you're looking for all the features, all the controls,
YOU1000000016_S0000113	all the bells and whistles, then you're really probably not going to be looking at Casta. You're going to be more looking at Restream or at Switchboard.
YOU1000000016_S0000114	Now obviously with those two, which one is going to be the best fit for you? You've really got to come back to those pricing tables and see what the restrictions are.
YOU1000000016_S0000115	and what you actually get access to for those different plans.
YOU1000000016_S0000116	But if you're someone who's not looking for all those advanced features and really wants the best bang for buck to be able to get your broadcast out to multiple platforms,
YOU1000000016_S0000117	then it's really going to go hands down to Casta. I really think that what they're offering, especially for the price and even on the free plan, is just insane. And it's
YOU1000000016_S0000118	Again, it's easy to get up and running and get it working with your live streaming platform. So I'm going to quickly log into Castr and show you how easy it is to get set up.
YOU1000000016_S0000119	Once you're logged in, all you need to do is go to add a stream and choose new restream.
YOU1000000016_S0000120	Pop up on the side to give your stream a name. Let's just go test.
YOU1000000016_S0000121	1 and select your region
YOU1000000016_S0000123	I'm in Australia now, so I'll pick Sydney, but choose the closest one to you.
YOU1000000016_S0000124	and press save.
YOU1000000016_S0000125	Next, all you need to do is to add in the platform, so you wanna broadcast to. So you come over here and go add platform.
YOU1000000016_S0000126	And these are all the supported platforms. So you can either choose a custom server or pick one of the ones that are preset in here.
YOU1000000016_S0000127	So let's just use YouTube. Now, in this case, you need to connect your channel by signing into your YouTube channel.
YOU1000000016_S0000128	or you can use your own server or string key that's provided in the platform.
YOU1000000016_S0000129	Once you've logged in it says YouTube is connected and it's saving. This is where you can give your YouTube stream a title.
YOU1000000016_S0000130	test stream
YOU1000000016_S0000131	One, obviously you wanna come up with something a bit more creative. You can also add in your stream description in there as well and hit save down the bottom.
YOU1000000016_S0000132	So now that you've got YouTube in there, we can add in another platform as well, just going through the exact same process.
YOU1000000016_S0000133	So I'll back out of this now, cancel that one.
YOU1000000016_S0000135	So you can queue up all of your different platforms in here.
YOU1000000016_S0000136	then all you need to know here is this is your streaming details that you put into your live streaming software.
YOU1000000016_S0000137	So whether it's OBS, XSplit, Wirecast, Vmix, this is your streaming server and this is your streaming key. So once you've set that up
YOU1000000016_S0000138	in your application and started your live stream, then your live stream will show up here. It says waiting for stream. So then all you need to do is come over to
YOU1000000016_S0000139	your live streaming software. For this case, we're going to use OBS.
YOU1000000016_S0000140	And we'll go settings, go to stream and under stream type you'll want to choose custom streaming server
YOU1000000016_S0000141	and this is where you paste in your server and your string key, hit OK.
YOU1000000016_S0000143	and now when we hit start streaming we'll see it pop up over here that our stream is coming through and then you can toggle on and off
YOU1000000016_S0000144	the different providers while you're actually live.
YOU1000000016_S0000145	then you can bring up your chat overlay or the chat URL that you can visit to view and interact with the chat. That's also what you will use to bring into Wirecast or OBS.
YOU1000000016_S0000146	or you can sync your chat with Discord as well. So now that you're all set up to live stream to multiple platforms with twice the potential audience,
YOU1000000016_S0000147	that's twice as important for you to nail your lighting and to get your lighting looking just right. Great segue, Justin.
YOU1000000016_S0000148	The link down the screen is a video which is the complete lighting tutorial to help you out with the lighting in your videos. And the other video is a video from YouTube.
YOU1000000016_S0000149	I don't know. Could be good. Let me know. I'll see you soon.
YOU1000000020_S0000001	Magic the Gathering is a collectible card game. It's strategic in nature. It's got a little bit of hidden information where you're hiding your cards from your opponents.
YOU1000000020_S0000002	if you're playing your cards onto the battlefield, attacking and blocking with them, and trying to reduce your opponent to zero life.
YOU1000000020_S0000003	People collect the cards like baseball cards.
YOU1000000020_S0000004	and then they play a strategy game with them that's kind of like a combination of poker and chess. Poker that you play with the cards you draw, but chess in that each card's like a different piece.
YOU1000000020_S0000005	From the cards you collect, you get to customize your own deck and your own experience and make it your own.
YOU1000000020_S0000006	When your true foes reveal themselves, will you do everything in your power to conquer them?
YOU1000000020_S0000008	It has a fantasy flavor and feel to it. That can be something that's very important to you, all the way down to not that important to you at all.
YOU1000000020_S0000009	One of the things that makes Magic accessible to new players is that luck is absolutely going to be a factor. Unlike a game like chess, where you will always lose if you're worse.
YOU1000000020_S0000010	In magic you sometimes win. It's kind of like a little bit of a gateway. It helps you feel good while you're learning.
YOU1000000020_S0000011	Magic is the biggest now that it's ever been, by a lot.
YOU1000000020_S0000013	I think we guessed certainly upwards of 10 million people playing the game worldwide.
YOU1000000020_S0000015	No matter which language you speak, the rules are the same everywhere. Your cars might be in English, his cars might be Japanese, but you both can communicate very easily.
YOU1000000020_S0000016	When I was growing up, most people who were playing games weren't really seen as the cool kids. But now, you know, there's professional gamers on TV.
YOU1000000020_S0000017	This is just so much more a part of the culture than it was 10, 15 years ago.
YOU1000000020_S0000018	All right, I'm going to play a fifth mana card and then I'm going to attack with my elder beast
YOU1000000020_S0000019	Can Kenny block his elder beast?
YOU1000000020_S0000020	Not with his shapeshifter, it's already tapped.
YOU1000000020_S0000021	Four damage to your planeswalker.
YOU1000000020_S0000022	Oh! No! The game is just so polished and so well done.
YOU1000000020_S0000023	It might just be the best game ever made.
YOU1000000020_S0000025	Good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good night.
YOU1000000020_S0000026	You are welcome to our live exclusive coverage of the final of Pro Tour Born of the Gods. Will it be the ice-cool Sean McLaren or 18-year-old Jacob Wilson?
YOU1000000020_S0000027	If he wins this match, Jacob will be the first champion younger than the Game of Magic.
YOU1000000020_S0000029	Jacob hasn't attacked even once.
YOU1000000020_S0000031	Jacob really needs to not play this harmonic sliver here.
YOU1000000020_S0000033	Sean McLaren, is it staticastic?
YOU1000000020_S0000035	in your birds of paradise and that is the end. Sean McLaren is your champion. He is king of the hill.
YOU1000000020_S0000037	Jacob, congratulations. I can tell, of course, you're disappointed. Who wouldn't be?
YOU1000000020_S0000038	Right now I feel a little physically ill, but I think tomorrow I can look back and be proud about this and hope to win the next one.
YOU1000000020_S0000039	Yep, well come back win the next one ladies and gentlemen your finalist a great ambassador for the game Jacob Wilson. Good job
YOU1000000020_S0000041	The Magic Pro Tour is pretty much the highest competitive stage for Magic. There's four major events a year, the Pro Tours, that each have a quarter million dollar prize pool with $40,000 to the winner.
YOU1000000020_S0000042	You can only attend the Pro Tours if you're invited.
YOU1000000020_S0000043	You have to win a qualifier tournament just to get invited to a tournament that invites you to the Pro Tour.
YOU1000000020_S0000044	Probably a couple thousand people show up over the course of the weekend. You know, there's a live broadcast, so the Pro Tours are definitely the marquee events of Magic.
YOU1000000020_S0000046	This is an important tournament for Jacob in a big way. He had a bitter loss in his first Pro Tour. I remember looking at him after that happened.
YOU1000000020_S0000047	For somebody who doesn't show that much emotion on a regular basis, he was destroyed by that.
YOU1000000020_S0000049	Second place is the most painful position to finish.
YOU1000000020_S0000050	Sometimes people joke about second place being tied for dead last.
YOU1000000020_S0000051	I think that might have been the first time we saw Jacob. Like, you know, he has this kind of, like, flat exterior when he's playing Magic.
YOU1000000020_S0000052	And it was kind of shocking to see him being kind of like almost like crushed to lose in the finals. It's like being dropped off a cliff.
YOU1000000020_S0000053	Right when I lost I was kind of in disbelief I had won two out of the first three games and I felt advantaged and I really just thought that it was a guarantee
YOU1000000020_S0000054	Immediately after, I was pretty devastated and definitely bitter. I'm Jacob Wilson, and I'm a professional Magic player.
YOU1000000020_S0000056	I was introduced to Magic when I was really young. When I was 15, I just started playing in local tournaments like once a week, and when I got second place at the Pro Tour...
YOU1000000020_S0000057	I ended up going from like $100 in my bank account to $30,000, and like I was paying for school all by myself.
YOU1000000020_S0000058	At the beginning of this fall semester, I was qualified for the World Championships. It was a lot of work to do school and magic at the same time. So I wanted to take this semester off and just prepare the whole time.
YOU1000000020_S0000060	Right now, one of my biggest goals is to win a Pro Tour. And if I were to accomplish that, it would be a huge achievement and definitely one of the biggest ones of my life.
YOU1000000020_S0000062	Tonight could definitely be a late night. I often am a little bit too excited to sleep right before a big tournament like this.
YOU1000000020_S0000064	Yeah, I think it's pretty important to get a good night's sleep.
YOU1000000020_S0000065	I think most people try to.
YOU1000000020_S0000066	A lot of people use Adderall to focus and stuff like that.
YOU1000000020_S0000067	I got sleeping pills.
YOU1000000020_S0000068	Yeah.
YOU1000000020_S0000069	I like to wake up long before the tournament, so pretty soon I'll be taking a sleeping pill, listen to some music, and go to sleep.
YOU1000000020_S0000071	The pro scene is divided from a lot of people's experience playing Magic. It can be so many different things to so many different people.
YOU1000000020_S0000072	For the average person who's playing, it's much more likely a way that they sort of blow off steam after work, or just get together with friends, or a way that they bond with their family members.
YOU1000000020_S0000074	Pa, worry about the food more.
YOU1000000020_S0000075	Yeah, yeah, the food on the...
YOU1000000020_S0000076	It's about what are we cooking today?
YOU1000000020_S0000077	This is a Bucanesta sauce. We're going to have a lapine and then we'll have some stuffed chicken breast for bazooka.
YOU1000000020_S0000078	Nice. When people get invited to the Freno house, they know they're going to get two things, high-level vintage magic and great pasta.
YOU1000000020_S0000080	Over there is our collection, cards that we use to play Magic.
YOU1000000020_S0000081	Those cars there can provide a lot of hours of work, a lot of hours of fun, a lot of hours of family and friend recreation. So that's really what it is.
YOU1000000020_S0000082	Certain cards, you even remember where you were when you opened them, like the Clasa Sardia.
YOU1000000020_S0000084	We always had a fantasy background, starting from my oldest brother, which read a lot of Tolkien's work. We all read The Chronicles of Narnia.
YOU1000000020_S0000085	And then eventually I stumbled upon magic. It was actually in the back of chemistry class.
YOU1000000020_S0000086	I'm an Italian nerd. It's part of what makes me me. There's a lot of the old stuff right here.
YOU1000000020_S0000087	Yeah, folks.
YOU1000000020_S0000088	Specifically why this Savannah lion is kept in plastic is that it actually single-handedly won Ralph's beta black lotus.
YOU1000000020_S0000089	That card effectively won this card. Won this one. Beta Black Lotus.
YOU1000000020_S0000090	They're very valuable. Think about 1993 when we were opening up packs. You're paying $3 per pack. Now if you turn around to sell it, it could effectively be the down payment on a house.
YOU1000000020_S0000091	I mean, it's just absurd what has happened to the game.
YOU1000000020_S0000092	Another reason that I definitely love the game and why we play vintage is the older artwork.
YOU1000000020_S0000093	Sarah Angel is the card I have around simply because I've always loved the artwork.
YOU1000000020_S0000095	This is the backbone of my deck. It's called Misha's Workshop.
YOU1000000020_S0000097	To me, I very much gravitate towards the art. I always appreciated the fantasy art aspect.
YOU1000000020_S0000099	But there were some early pieces of art which had some symbolism which I think provoked people to bring out the bad aspects of fantasy.
YOU1000000020_S0000100	There were two cards in particular, Demonic Tutor and Unholy Strength, which had pentagrams on them.
YOU1000000020_S0000102	There was such a negative connotation to ritualistic activities.
YOU1000000020_S0000103	Anything to do with sacrifices, burnt offerings, and all of these terms just started to surface.
YOU1000000020_S0000104	Magic, the gathering. So let's see where they're coming from. How many see a pentagram? If you look, there it is.
YOU1000000020_S0000105	Perception of parents where I don't want my kids playing this because I don't like the imagery
YOU1000000020_S0000106	Here's one of the cards. It's a dead, rotting, decaying thing that's been in the ground. And remember it said that it's an occult game.
YOU1000000020_S0000107	One of the dangers of this thing is that it's played with the mind. How many know that the mind is a very fragile thing?
YOU1000000020_S0000108	teenage kids, their parents still had influence on what they could play.
YOU1000000020_S0000109	Now it's different.
YOU1000000020_S0000110	They quickly retracted those printings and that really quelled a lot of the fires of the whole satanic imagery.
YOU1000000020_S0000111	That negative paradigm that followed magic in its beginning years are now over. And I think you're starting to see now the growth of it is changing.
YOU1000000020_S0000113	I look at fantasy as one of my little escapes.
YOU1000000020_S0000115	For those couple hours that I'm playing, it allows me to just, you know, I'll come back to my problems when I'm finished.
YOU1000000020_S0000117	The pro tour player in particular, it's a grind. Those guys will sleep on someone's couch one Wednesday, wake up next Wednesday, they're elsewhere. I mean, it's a grind for those guys.
YOU1000000020_S0000118	I just wonder how much fun all of them are having. I'm sure there are people that find it rewarding, just not for me, and not for our community.
YOU1000000020_S0000119	Yeah, absolutely.
YOU1000000020_S0000121	We always made it communal. We've always believed in that aspect of it. Maybe that's why we gravitate to vintage so well.
YOU1000000020_S0000122	You know, we treat everyone fairly. We try not to make people feel uncomfortable. If they're new, we kind of welcome them because no one's bigger than the game.
YOU1000000020_S0000123	The game has to be about community.
YOU1000000020_S0000125	I would like to welcome you to the Pro Tour V340DC. Congratulations for qualifying and have a very, very good weekend. Thank you.
YOU1000000020_S0000126	Keep your head straight in front of you. If you're looking to the side, we may misinterpret where you're looking. So please keep your head straight ahead of you.
YOU1000000020_S0000128	I won the first round, which is great. It's good to get off to a good start. My opponent forgot something that would have benefited him.
YOU1000000020_S0000129	Like if you forget what your card does it's not my responsibility to remind him
YOU1000000020_S0000131	I'm normally pretty quiet with my phone in. During the game I don't really like to chit-chat.
YOU1000000020_S0000132	He can be sometimes quiet. He's a he's a relatively quiet guy. I haven't really gotten to know him super well
YOU1000000020_S0000133	Jacob Wilson attacking for lethal using path to exile. Just saw a handshake.
YOU1000000020_S0000134	He's always very even, very calm, and always finds the right play.
YOU1000000020_S0000136	Oh, he finally slogged through. How do you beat that? So Jacob Wilson moves on.
YOU1000000020_S0000138	It's the end of the day and I finished 7-1 which is pretty great. It's the best record I've ever had at a pro tour. I can't really ask for much more.
YOU1000000020_S0000139	Dude, you went 7-1 today. That's fucking insane. I know, it's great. Great work. Thanks.
YOU1000000020_S0000141	We're holding white bits of paper and that means it's time for the end of day wrap. Jacob Wilson is ahead of the curve.
YOU1000000020_S0000142	You've already called it there. You're saying Jacob Wilson for the win.
YOU1000000020_S0000143	A terrific job by him and all these players here on behalf of everyone at Wizards of the Coast saying bye.
YOU1000000020_S0000146	Alright mama, bye.
YOU1000000020_S0000148	Vintage is a great game, not only because of the old nostalgic cards, the powerful cards, the dramatic plays. The true reason why it's great is the community.
YOU1000000020_S0000149	The people that make up the game are amazing. Everyone's friendly, everyone's accepting. You walk into a room and you'll have 40 friends.
YOU1000000020_S0000151	This is vintage. Right now we're doing an eight-man tournament, just getting together with friends and playing cards.
YOU1000000020_S0000153	My core strategy is generally to stop what he wants to do slowly. Picture a boa constrictor.
YOU1000000020_S0000154	slowly wrapping around somebody. And once he is in a perfect position, now he can squeeze the air out of him.
YOU1000000020_S0000155	But I have to upgad the ball that has to get in position first That's the best way I could explain what the deck wants to do. It's planning it out
YOU1000000020_S0000156	It's how do you get there. It's stopping your opponent from doing what he wants to while slowly reeling him in.
YOU1000000020_S0000158	What I would really say about Vintage is it really is how the game was intended to be played.
YOU1000000020_S0000159	Vintage is the purest form of the game. It plays with all the cards from originally printed up until the ones which are being hot off the presses.
YOU1000000020_S0000160	Wizard of the Coast, who is the creator of this game, they kind of, I guess, believed there were errors in the original card that were made.
YOU1000000020_S0000161	And they kind of wanted to put them away in a small place where they could be forgotten about.
YOU1000000020_S0000162	but they definitely left us out in the cold a little bit. And that's why in the vintage community we have to self-regulate and why people look at us as the Wild Wild West because we've had a little bit of the cold shoulder from the parent company.
YOU1000000020_S0000163	My opponent right now is Greg Fett. He's very well known in the vintage community. We put out some really good players from here.
YOU1000000020_S0000165	I got into looking at misprints of cards. They probably should have been caught and destroyed by quality control, but didn't. For example, these two.
YOU1000000020_S0000166	There's actually no physical card here. This has too much blue. This has too much black ink. There are miscut cards that come in packs. My friend just found these.
YOU1000000020_S0000167	We really didn't have a story on it. I thought they were incredible. I thought I would get them framed at first. But then every time an opportunity came along to get another misprint, I definitely wanted to.
YOU1000000020_S0000168	Anything else in there that's worth seeing?
YOU1000000020_S0000169	Yes, but I realized I actually can't show something in here, which I'll show you guys privately. Yeah, I just realized that and that's why I'm stopping now.
YOU1000000020_S0000170	What's wrong with it?
YOU1000000020_S0000173	Today, today it looks like he has this one.
YOU1000000020_S0000174	I'd say the Farinos are the godfathers and a lot of people do regard them as the creators of these certain decks.
YOU1000000020_S0000175	Anytime you bring up these old decks, they're like, oh yeah, the Freenos built this, built that.
YOU1000000020_S0000177	We were talking earlier about the pro-tourism, how all these kids are kind of young. Do you ever think that you would have tried to do that?
YOU1000000020_S0000178	I tell you what, there's a part of me as being a natural competitor, I probably wouldn't have minded a small opportunity to have done it.
YOU1000000020_S0000179	I would have to have been at the appropriate age. Right now we're trying to win a world championship in this format. That's the actual goal, but to answer the question, I would have given it a chance.
YOU1000000020_S0000181	Welcome to day two of Pro Tour Fate Reforged coming to you live.
YOU1000000020_S0000182	Now, when you get to the late stages of a tournament like this, there's a lot on the line.
YOU1000000020_S0000183	Jacob Wilson has been utterly dominant this weekend, but he just suffered a brutal loss in the hands of Eric Froehlich. And if he doesn't make the top eight, that last play is gonna come back to haunt him.
YOU1000000020_S0000186	Here we are, it's the last round of the day. It all comes down to this. If Jacob Wilson wins, he advances to the final day. If he loses, he is done.
YOU1000000020_S0000187	Our first player Seth Manfield standing in his way Jacob Wilson
YOU1000000020_S0000189	All right, here's lava spike to take Jacob Wilson down to ten
YOU1000000020_S0000191	Down to two is Jacob.
YOU1000000020_S0000193	Jacob's turning the tables and going on the offensive here. He's got his guns blazing against Seth, and Seth has fallen to six.
YOU1000000020_S0000194	This is just about as close as they get.
YOU1000000020_S0000196	That's game. Siege Rhino. That's gonna do it. Jacob Wilson has won.
YOU1000000020_S0000197	He had a single copy of that card in his deck and it showed up at just the right time. What are the odds?
YOU1000000020_S0000198	How do you feel as Seth Manfield right now?
YOU1000000020_S0000199	I want to throw up.
YOU1000000020_S0000201	I'm very blessed. I almost lost. I drew kitchen finks. I almost lost even with the lid on. I didn't have the finks. I would have lost.
YOU1000000020_S0000203	So Jacob was about to die to a lethal barrage of burn spells and then drew his single copy of the white leyline to protect himself.
YOU1000000020_S0000204	and his opponent had one chance to draw something, didn't, and pulled out the win.
YOU1000000020_S0000205	From Canada, Jacob Wilson.
YOU1000000020_S0000207	If I win the Pro Tour, that would be a defining moment of my life. Magic is the thing I've put the most effort into, and winning the Pro Tour is the biggest accomplishment you can have in Magic.
YOU1000000020_S0000209	Hello and welcome to the last quarterfinal of Pro Tour Faker Forge. We are going to start off with Jelgir Vigismat against Jacob Wilson, a 19 year old.
YOU1000000020_S0000210	returning to the top eight of a modern pro tour, made the finals last year.
YOU1000000020_S0000211	Let's get right down to the floor and see who is going to win between Jelger Vigesma and Jacob Wilson.
YOU1000000020_S0000213	The other's hand has everything.
YOU1000000020_S0000215	Jacob is in game three and a two out of three against
YOU1000000020_S0000216	Jelger Wiegersma, who is a Dutch Hall of Fame Magic player, so not an easy opponent.
YOU1000000020_S0000218	Game 1, Jelgur had an instant win combo that involved making an infinite number of fairies that all attack at once for infinite damage.
YOU1000000020_S0000219	And then in game two, Jacob was able to survive despite the fact that Yelger reigned in anger of the gods that destroyed all of Jacob's creatures.
YOU1000000020_S0000220	But then Jacob summoned an elephant soldier called Loxodon Smiter that finished the job and killed Yelgrin in game two. So now we're on to game three.
YOU1000000020_S0000221	Jacob's got a very good start but Joggers deck is capable of winning in an eye blink so the suspense is pretty good.
YOU1000000020_S0000223	Voice of resurgence, he's running through what could he have. Jacob does not have a lot of outs here. Things are not looking good for him.
YOU1000000020_S0000225	I'm gonna put this Splinter Twin on this Pestermite. Do you have a response? Shows the path to exile to Jelger, who now will show him the Dispel.
YOU1000000020_S0000226	And that should be...
YOU1000000020_S0000228	the game. There's the hand, Jogur Vigashima advances to the semifinals over Jacob Wilson.
YOU1000000020_S0000230	Another great performance from young Jacob Wilson, but it wasn't quite enough against the Dutch Hall of Famer. I know this has to be so disappointing for him.
YOU1000000020_S0000232	You're graded on how many top eights you've achieved. I think that ultimately, Jacob is going to embrace that fact.
YOU1000000020_S0000233	and as he starts stacking up more and more top 8s, you're gonna see him accept the fact that there is something to be gained from making the top 8.
YOU1000000020_S0000234	even if it isn't winning the tournament. And for such a young person, he's already off to a great start.
YOU1000000020_S0000236	There definitely is a balance of skill and luck in Magic. Anybody can win. The better player is often going to win, but that's one of the main appeals, I think.
YOU1000000020_S0000238	Having a variety of experiences be possible because of the element of chance is a huge part of just games being fun.
YOU1000000020_S0000240	Magic's ever-changing. The cards are continuing to be good, the sets they produce continue to be excellent, and if that stopped, then magic would take a step back, but...
YOU1000000020_S0000241	If you're going to keep making great cards and making the game interesting, then the game's going to continue to really excel.
YOU1000000020_S0000242	You know, Magic is 20 years old. Magic is old enough that there are people who played the game when they were younger who are sharing it with their younger generation.
YOU1000000020_S0000243	Good game. GG. GG. OK, you want to play another round?
YOU1000000020_S0000244	Yeah, let's go.
YOU1000000020_S0000246	We've been playing this for 20 years now. It's such really a part of us that I'm expecting to be in a vintage world 20 years from now. And I'm expecting to be the old man.
YOU1000000020_S0000247	And when someone looks at me and he's 18, 20 years old and he says, oh, I got this old guy, he doesn't know what he's doing. He's in for a shock. He's in for a surprise. He doesn't know that I've been playing this for 40 years.
YOU1000000020_S0000248	As long as I have the faculties to play it, I will play.
YOU1000000020_S0000250	I'm definitely enjoying Magic right now and I can see playing it for a while. If this year does go poorly and I don't make Platinum, I'd also be happy to go back to school and try
YOU1000000020_S0000252	to put more of my effort into that.
YOU1000000020_S0000254	Invitational in Richmond. I'm here with our champion Jacob Wilson. Congratulations, man. Thank you very much the handshake. It's a little bit of hardware You're no stranger to this
YOU1000000020_S0000255	Yeah, I'll put these with my other ones.
YOU1000000020_S0000257	Okay, seven cards right?
YOU1000000020_S0000258	All right, seven guards.
YOU1000000020_S0000259	It's really fun. Just started playing today and I'm decent.
YOU1000000020_S0000260	You're decent. I'm a noob.
YOU1000000020_S0000261	We're both noobs.
YOU1000000020_S0000262	Ha! But... we're okay.
YOU1000000020_S0000263	We're teaching each other, kind of.
YOU1000000020_S0000264	We're learning.
YOU1000000020_S0000266	Are you kidding me right now? I just need land. One land and I can destroy you.
YOU1000000020_S0000267	Yet nothing you scrub.
YOU1000000020_S0000268	I didn't know anything about magic until today except for that it was card game. Now I'm already obsessed with it.
YOU1000000023_S0000001	Fire Emblem. This magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question, what if chess made you horny?
YOU1000000023_S0000002	Fire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and a few spin-offs, it's safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary. The games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters like Marth.
YOU1000000023_S0000003	That's not Marth? Marth. That's... Which one is Marth?
YOU1000000023_S0000005	Marth.
YOU1000000023_S0000006	The problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together. One needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that Fire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.
YOU1000000023_S0000007	It's like trying to remember your co-workers' names after meeting them once at a work mixer, except in this case your co-workers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.
YOU1000000023_S0000009	But do not worry, there is an answer to this conundrum. Because today, I am going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.
YOU1000000023_S0000011	My face is just not built for this expression.
YOU1000000023_S0000012	First step in this process is to collect a list of the characters. Turns out, even after trimming the non-playable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage sessions, there are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.
YOU1000000023_S0000013	I cannot explain that many characters. I have made that mistake before. Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, but the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them.
YOU1000000023_S0000014	And I now understand that explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn't actually be helpful. Human beings aren't meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don't believe me, just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.
YOU1000000023_S0000015	I have a contact for someone named Zane, and in the company, it just says Bocce Ball.
YOU1000000023_S0000017	Who the fuck is this? But unlike my contact list, Fire Emblems have plotlines, and in my experience playing these games, I noticed that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.
YOU1000000023_S0000018	And I'm not the only one who's noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list of archetypes based on different characters. A list that I only found after spending a whole day trying to categorize them on my own.
YOU1000000023_S0000019	And it's just so fun to realize that you've wasted a whole day of work. But this list intrigued me. Stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.
YOU1000000023_S0000020	Does that remind you of anything? Of course it does! It reminds you of the Comedia del Arte, because it reminds me of the Comedia del Arte. And it's so obviously the Comedia del Arte that I don't need to explain it.
YOU1000000023_S0000021	but I will for the sake of extending this video. The Commedia dell'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries, and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.
YOU1000000023_S0000022	That way the audience could be like, ah that dude's wearing a tight-fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must be Arlecchino, the servant clown sometimes to two masters! This brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.
YOU1000000023_S0000023	In the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game. And this is how we're going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.
YOU1000000023_S0000024	Fire Emblem goes one step further, because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose, but they can have a similar role in the gameplay.
YOU1000000023_S0000025	And this goes to prove my theory that Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to Comedia Del Arte, it is its natural evolution. An elevated form I call... The Comedia Del Anime!
YOU1000000023_S0000026	the newer, more perfect form of theater. We just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into syrupy stock characters. Let's begin with the archetypes that are standard.
YOU1000000023_S0000027	Cain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense. Bord and Chords are similar, except they're usually axe fighters. Pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.
YOU1000000023_S0000028	You can't split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them. You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi. And in the same way, you can't have a board without a chord. Which is my favorite Dr. Seuss-pa.
YOU1000000023_S0000029	Jagens are mentors that are strong at the beginning and then you'll quickly outpace them and it's kinda sad, like the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game. Oifes are similar to Jagens, except they'll keep dunking on you till you're dead.
YOU1000000023_S0000030	Wendel's are mentors but for magic, Gotoh's are mentors but only the last half of the game. Beowulfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency to recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.
YOU1000000023_S0000031	which is, by definition, not a mercenary. Navars are silent, moody sword swingers, kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade. There are also a bunch of villains, but for different reasons.
YOU1000000023_S0000032	Power. Ambition. Loyalty. Wyvern riding, I guess. And getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.
YOU1000000023_S0000033	Some archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements, very difficult to recruit, usually recruited after they've been kidnapped, late game recruits that could be good but you have to work hard, super low level villagers that could also be good. And if you recruit one of these pairs,
YOU1000000023_S0000034	you can't get the other. Kind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup. Corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character, and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.
YOU1000000023_S0000035	It's kind of like Fire Emblem doesn't know how to make interesting characters without making them suffer traumatic parental death.
YOU1000000023_S0000037	Tacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers. Young male mages.
YOU1000000023_S0000039	Thieves.
YOU1000000023_S0000041	Georges do that thing where they pretend to be not important and then, surprise, I wasn't an old crow and I was a magical witch the whole time! Except they're not very good at hiding the fact that they're important. And the creepy version of the Georges, the Tiki's.
YOU1000000023_S0000042	Usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except they're really 400 years old and a god or a dragon, and I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.
YOU1000000023_S0000043	These 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters. There are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we're gonna end up with 75 archetypes.
YOU1000000023_S0000044	The Commedia dell'arte only has about 17, so before we move on, let's combine some. These six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness. These are all defined by their villainy, and only some of them become playable.
YOU1000000023_S0000045	Welcome to Kane Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling-like bond and do the same job. These all have very specific requirements for recruiting. These both do that thing where they don't seem important and then surprise, I'm important!
YOU1000000023_S0000046	These are all hard to make good, but they're worth it if you put the effort in. These are all precocious little magic babies. And that leaves the Navars unconnected, but that's because I'm changing the archetype to spicy swords.
YOU1000000023_S0000047	because we can include so many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any sword wielder who's a little spicy.
YOU1000000023_S0000048	In fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who fit into these expanded definitions. We are left with 288 characters to categorize.
YOU1000000023_S0000049	But before I get there, I just want to commend Fire Emblem for having 596 playable characters and only repeating three names. When I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym, I was one of five employees named Brian.
YOU1000000023_S0000050	And it was a small gym. But I guess it's pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Scrimere, Dagdar, Sleuth, Fjorm, Belf.
YOU1000000023_S0000052	I could go on all day. But I won't. Because it's time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.
YOU1000000023_S0000054	That took like 30 minutes. But let's begin. The honorable knight like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people and will always oppose cruelty to civilians.
YOU1000000023_S0000055	which is way better than the loyal knight like Trude, who only is loyal to Pern, and will do literally anything for him even though Pern is a bad dude, but I'll get to that later.
YOU1000000023_S0000056	These four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party. I'm just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now, because Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath.
YOU1000000023_S0000057	And so sometimes you just need more meat for the grind. You know? Similar to the blank slate is the protagonist, which is always relatively heroic, but since they're a conduit for the player, they're all pretty vague.
YOU1000000023_S0000058	I realize that by smooshing them all together into one category, I've made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.
YOU1000000023_S0000059	But that's not my fault. Super Smash should have included more magic babies. Arrogance, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side, but arrogance like Viki just think they're the best, hotheads like Kaspar want to fight anything that moves,
YOU1000000023_S0000060	and edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically. A lot of these characters have rough childhoods, but then turn out cheerful despite that. And then there's the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called the majority of children in Fire Emblem Fates.
YOU1000000023_S0000061	Perfectionists, mischief-makers, and flirts are all highly motivated, but Tsubaki is motivated to meet high expectations, Claude is motivated to make intricate schemes, and Sylvain is motivated to be a fuckboy.
YOU1000000023_S0000062	Buzzkills are just characters that aren't very fun to talk to, and Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber-religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert. It also doesn't help that I look like Hanuman Light.
YOU1000000023_S0000064	Oh god, am I a buzzkill? A lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait. Scarlet's straightforward, Valbar's chill, Linhart's lazy, Sumia's clumsy, Petra's a sweetie, and Randolph is a furry.
YOU1000000023_S0000065	Dramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts and how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead. Some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms or by calling out the noble class. That's why they're comrades.
YOU1000000023_S0000066	Child Soldier. Karen is canonically 14 years old.
YOU1000000023_S0000068	Whoopsie! But even if they aren't a child, they could still be naive, which brings around the overprotective archetype, which is just essentially helicopter parents.
YOU1000000023_S0000069	Manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it, and that makes her the president of Vices.
YOU1000000023_S0000070	the vice president. But be careful not to do that around someone like Astrum, who is constantly accusing people of treason for no good reason.
YOU1000000023_S0000071	There's a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype, because Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self-conscious and then can wreck shop on the battlefield.
YOU1000000023_S0000072	Here's an archetype I call What the Fuck, and it's the three characters that make me say, what the fuck, Fire Emblem. People like Pern, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type, except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.
YOU1000000023_S0000073	Or Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter. Or Roger, who is actually, he's not actually that bad.
YOU1000000023_S0000074	But Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his end screams say that he never gets a date and he stays single for the rest of his life. And it's like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem, you didn't have to do him dirty like that.
YOU1000000023_S0000075	The next archetype is called Actually Pretty Interesting. These characters are three-dimensional and well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible self-doubt even though he's doing all he can to help those around him.
YOU1000000023_S0000076	Or Rhys, who dreams of being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won't allow him to become one. And so he helps in the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.
YOU1000000023_S0000078	And that's it. Those are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem. Until we get to Raphael, my sweet bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.
YOU1000000023_S0000079	The thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos. Welcome to the age of thembos. There.
YOU1000000023_S0000080	45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.
YOU1000000023_S0000081	If you're a gosh dang rocket scientist, 45 is still too much. We can combine these. We'll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.
YOU1000000023_S0000082	These three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called, Holy Shit, Why Are You A Soldier? Let's just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes. And now we can take these straight-talkin' suck-ups and call them teacher's pets.
YOU1000000023_S0000084	Shh. These three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through. These three archetypes really explore familial bonds, which is a rare condition in this day- Whether it's a good or a bad reaction doesn't matter to this group, they just want to be seen.
YOU1000000023_S0000085	They're just too nice for all this. These four archetypes will always be subverting expectations. It's fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in. Chill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks? Damn if these aren't fun to hang out with.
YOU1000000023_S0000086	All three of these are going to timeout because they need to calm it down. And there we go. The 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters. Just 13 of them. That is fewer than the Comedia dell'arte.
YOU1000000023_S0000088	It's only 13.
YOU1000000023_S0000090	which is not only an unlucky number, but it is too large for your tiny child brains. We can make it better. We can combine more. We can perfect this. Granted, it's a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat,
YOU1000000023_S0000091	we can take Look At Me Baby and Making Waves and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters. And the Necessary But Boring and the Asshole Crew and the Teacher's Pets and the Calm It Downs, they all fill me with a sense of UGH.
YOU1000000023_S0000092	And obviously the too nice for this and the light on your resume and the holy shit why are you a soldier's are all just a bad choice for a war.
YOU1000000023_S0000093	And that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break the ice with, and the ones that have family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that are fun to hang out with.
YOU1000000023_S0000094	And that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill awkward family reunion. And when you think about it, these ones are just, they're strange characters that have, that are good at fighting. I mean, if you include Dimitri in this, he has an eye patch.
YOU1000000023_S0000095	which is similar to these ones. Seneth and Byleth have the, they rhyme. We also, I mean, Dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat. Think about that. Don't even get me started on Oboro.
YOU1000000023_S0000096	I don't know who that is. Is it pronounced dice or dee-say? And we could have a category called anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence, and that's just the one category.
YOU1000000023_S0000097	which proofs that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same and that you cannot differentiate them. Mission complete.
YOU1000000023_S0000099	What was this unraveled about again?
YOU1000000023_S0000101	I'm the servant clown sometimes to two masters!
YOU1000000023_S0000102	Now Italian.
YOU1000000023_S0000104	Oh, that's gross!
YOU1000000023_S0000106	All the dudes wearing the tight-fitting suit with the bunch of weird patches. It must be Arlequin or the servant crown. Sometimes the tutu masters. Okay.
YOU1000000023_S0000108	I don't know. We don't have to use it but we need to record it.
YOU1000000029_S0000001	The polls have closed in three more states at 7.30 in the east. At this point, Bill Clinton has 58 electoral votes. Bob Dole, nothing yet.
YOU1000000029_S0000003	CNN coverage of Election 96. Live from CNN Center, here are Judy Woodruff, Bernard Shaw, Bill Schneider, and Ken Bode.
YOU1000000029_S0000005	And the biggest electoral prize at this half hour, we can tell you, is the state of Ohio. CNN calls that the state of Ohio has been won by President Clinton. This is a big victory, Ken Boate, for the Democrats.
YOU1000000029_S0000006	That is true. No Republican has ever been elected without carrying Ohio. And it's also further bad news because for the last 30 years, this state has voted for the winning candidate.
YOU1000000029_S0000007	CNN declares that Bill Clinton has won West Virginia's five electoral votes.
YOU1000000029_S0000008	Not a big surprise that West Virginia is reliably democratic. Every congressman, senator, the governor in both houses of the state legislature is controlled by the Democrats.
YOU1000000029_S0000009	Polls have also just closed in the state of North Carolina, but at this hour, it is undecided among the three gentlemen you see there on the screen.
YOU1000000029_S0000010	Judy, this is fairly typical for North Carolina. This is a generally Republican state in presidential races, but George Bush won this state by less than 1% last time, his very closest state.
YOU1000000029_S0000011	These next two are going to surprise, if not shock you. First, in Indiana, CNN says that this one is too close to call. And in Kentucky, again, eight electoral votes in Kentucky, too close to call.
YOU1000000029_S0000012	and look at the percentage of reports.
YOU1000000029_S0000013	Here are three states where the polls closed half an hour ago. As yet, undecided. Georgia, the peach state.
YOU1000000029_S0000015	Virginia, the old dominion, still undecided.
YOU1000000029_S0000017	and South Carolina in the presidential contest undecided.
YOU1000000029_S0000019	Now let's move over to the electoral map to show you what we have so far. President Clinton leading Bob Dole, 58 electoral votes. The magic number is 270.
YOU1000000029_S0000021	Well, Ohio's the story of this.
YOU1000000029_S0000023	Ohio and this half hour Florida before that those are two big states and both in the Clinton column.
YOU1000000029_S0000024	And if you look at all the states that we have just said are too close to call, among all those states, the only one, I think if I wrote them down as fast as I could, the only one that a Democrat carried last time was Georgia, Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana were all Republican states.
YOU1000000029_S0000025	So what we have is the Republicans and a little bit of difficulty here. Mr. Dole.
YOU1000000029_S0000027	Well, Kentucky and Indiana is fascinating. Just fascinating. And the word was that if Dole started out in trouble in Kentucky and Indiana, if he lost them outright, the night would be over.
YOU1000000029_S0000028	We should say that he hasn't yeah, we don't know
YOU1000000029_S0000030	But in June he said if Bob Dole, he calls himself Bob Dole, he says if Bob Dole doesn't win Kentucky, Bob Dole can't win the presidency. But we don't know yet. But it's a tight one.
YOU1000000029_S0000031	That's right. Let's take a look now at the states that we know one or the other has won. And here it is for President Clinton, Florida. You've been hearing this. New Hampshire, Ohio, Vermont, and West Virginia.
YOU1000000029_S0000032	And that adds up to the what is it 58 you just counted
YOU1000000029_S0000034	Well.
YOU1000000029_S0000036	Bill Schneider, you want to take over with the Yanks at poles here and I'll save a thought I had.
YOU1000000029_S0000037	Okay, we're gonna take a look at the state of Ohio a big win for Bill Clinton and see how did he do it? Well, one third of the voters in Ohio were union members in the household and
YOU1000000029_S0000038	and they clearly went a majority, a solid majority for Bill Clinton. That big AFL-CIO push for the Democrats and for the Democratic president paid off in Ohio.
YOU1000000029_S0000040	Now, let's look at the voters who decided how they were going to vote just in the last three days. How did they end up voting? Well, they voted for Bob Dole. It looks like Dole talked about his momentum in the last few days.
YOU1000000029_S0000041	It was there, those leg deciders decided for him, but they were only 9% of the voters in Ohio. What about the voters who decided before October, who knew exactly how they were going to vote all along?
YOU1000000029_S0000042	they were the ones who delivered for Bill Clinton and that was 70% of the voters in Ohio. So while Dole picked up some late momentum,
YOU1000000029_S0000043	It couldn't compete with a tremendous number of voters, 70%, who knew how they were going to vote before the month even started out.
YOU1000000029_S0000044	You are very good with that John Madden. I ought to be jealous tonight.
YOU1000000029_S0000046	Checking the watch, it's time for crossfire. Here they come.
YOU1000000029_S0000048	Live from Washington, Crossfire. On the left, Geraldine Ferraro. On the right, Robert Novak. In the Crossfire.
YOU1000000029_S0000049	Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, advisor to the Dole camp campaign. And in New Orleans, Democratic Senator John Brough.
YOU1000000029_S0000051	Good evening, welcome to Crossfire. Finally, election day came with Bill Clinton casting his vote in the renovated train station in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Bob Dole voting at the First Christian Church in Russell, Kansas.
YOU1000000029_S0000052	The other millions of Americans voting today decided 35 Senate contests and 435 House races as well as the presidency. President Clinton is heavily favored for a second term.
YOU1000000029_S0000053	And the big question is, who controls Congress? What the Republicans narrowly favor. Jerry?
YOU1000000029_S0000055	Let's pick up on a little bit on those.
YOU1000000029_S0000057	talking about. We've had Ohio that has gone for Clinton. We have Kentucky, which Dole said was a must-win state too close to call.
YOU1000000029_S0000058	You see that Florida has gone to President Clinton. If Dole is in trouble in the South, do you see any scenario by which he could win this presidency tonight?
YOU1000000029_S0000059	Well, Jerry, as I mentioned before we went on, I just came off of the 96-hour trip with Senator Dole. We saw enthusiasm every place we went. I think that California is still in play.
YOU1000000029_S0000060	I think that there's a lot of southern states that went for President Clinton last time, and I certainly think that even though they may be, quote, undecided, I still believe Kentucky and Indiana, for example, will go.
YOU1000000029_S0000061	for Senator Dole, but I don't discount the importance of Florida and Ohio. They're important states.
YOU1000000029_S0000062	So that with all things being equal, if this trend continues, Senator Dole will stay in Washington or go back to Kansas but not be president of the United States.
YOU1000000029_S0000063	Well, you know, we've just got a few states and I'd like to see what happens in some of the other bigger Midwestern states and also in the Southwest as well as the South.
YOU1000000029_S0000064	If you take a look at the Senate races in a lot of the states, too, New Hampshire has gone to a Democrat. There are other states where it's just too close to call, and there are only a limited number of seats that Democrats need to take it over.
YOU1000000029_S0000065	What is your feeling on this? You've been looking at the numbers all along.
YOU1000000029_S0000067	My feeling is that we pick up like one seat. I'm sure that John Breaux may have a different view, but I think we'd pick up the four Southern open Democrat seats.
YOU1000000029_S0000068	and the other ones really just are too close to call, like Oregon and Colorado and Maine is a very close race. Georgia too. Georgia, yeah. And Arkansas is close. So I think that we may be up very late tonight.
YOU1000000029_S0000069	Senator John Breaux, this is very good news for President Clinton, but I wonder if you're popping champagne corks yet?
YOU1000000029_S0000070	because all the early indications are that you're not going to control the Congress, you're not going to control the Senate or the House.
YOU1000000029_S0000071	So this is a kind of a weltschmerz. You know what weltschmerz means. It's a little bit of sorrow and a little bit of happiness, isn't it?
YOU1000000029_S0000072	and bobby must be struggling this is devastating news for senator dole in a sense when you don't not carry ohio which every republican president is always carried in you lose florida that's very bad news for senator dole
YOU1000000029_S0000073	as far as winning an electoral victory. And we're not finished voting here in Louisiana. We got about an hour and a half left, and I'm very confident that Mary Landrieu will be victorious.
YOU1000000029_S0000074	I think I would agree with John McCain, my friend, that the sentence is going to be very close. I would not be surprised if it was 51-49 either way.
YOU1000000029_S0000075	Well, can you explain to me how... by the way, of course, the winning Ohio and Florida does not come under the category of huge surprises. Everybody thought that the president was going to win those states.
YOU1000000029_S0000076	But I just would like to address my initial question, Senator, on how you can square the apparent big victory of President Clinton
YOU1000000029_S0000077	with the uh... with uh... with uh... uphill struggle i think you have to win the house and senate and let me just uh... give a suggestion of what's wrong you're dying in the south isn't that right
YOU1000000029_S0000078	I think we're going to do well in Georgia. I think we're going to win. I think we're going to win in Louisiana. We're going to win in Arkansas. But I think the basic answer to the question, Bob, is very simple, and that is that people vote for their senator or their governor.
YOU1000000029_S0000079	of
YOU1000000029_S0000080	But we feel very comfortable in the South. We've got good, moderate candidates, despite an onslaught of this liberal, liberal, liberal charge for people who are very moderate to middle-of-the-road candidates that we have.
YOU1000000029_S0000081	Isn't it true that the problem is that some of your candidates in the South, like Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Max Cleland in Georgia, were election year moderates? They've been liberals all their life, and perhaps the voters saw through them?
YOU1000000029_S0000082	Bob, it's really interesting, they charging Mary Landrieu with being a liberal. Here's a person who supports the death penalty, supports carrying concealed weapons in Louisiana, and also will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. That doesn't sound very liberal to me.
YOU1000000029_S0000083	She's awesome.
YOU1000000029_S0000084	That's what she's been charged with.
YOU1000000029_S0000085	She also opposed the bill to ban the late-term abortions.
YOU1000000029_S0000086	Absolutely.
YOU1000000029_S0000088	Bob, there you go again falling for some of the Republican rhetoric. She clearly has said that she would have voted just like me and Bennett Johnson on that issue, but her opponent and others keep saying, well, that's not her position. That's what she said very clearly.
YOU1000000029_S0000089	We're going to break right now. We're going to come back and discuss whether or not there is going to be a majority in the House that's a Democratic majority or Republican majority right after this break.
YOU1000000029_S0000092	Crossfire is brought to you by LCI International, a very different long-distance phone company. And by Chrysler and the cab-forward sedan of Chrysler. What's new in your world?
YOU1000000029_S0000094	Welcome back to Crossfire. We're talking about election 96 with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and adult advisor in New Orleans, Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana.
YOU1000000029_S0000096	Senator, let me just pursue this whole thing about a Republican majority in the Senate just a little bit further because a lot of us are worried about what will happen once that Democratic majority, Republican majority comes in. If a Republican majority comes in,
YOU1000000029_S0000097	Are you guys going to go after the Clinton administration again for another four years, or are you going to get down to some serious work in the Senate for a change?
YOU1000000029_S0000098	Jerry, could I mention what, real quick before I answer, and that is that we are pleased to see the closure in the popular vote. As you know, many of the polls like ABC had President Clinton by 16 and the teens and
YOU1000000029_S0000099	looks like that's significant closure, which could affect some of these other states. But look, Jerry, you would agree with me that what has been happening
YOU1000000029_S0000100	when this foreign money is really incredible. And it isn't being reported by the Republicans. It's every major newspaper in America. There clearly has to be an investigation of that.
YOU1000000029_S0000101	If that's called going after the president, then yeah, we'll be going after it if we have the majority. But I think that, I mean, I've been around politics for a long time, the three of us have. I've never seen anything like this. I've never seen...
YOU1000000029_S0000102	What we just saw on the front page of the New York Times today, Mr. Riotti had what, 12 visits?
YOU1000000029_S0000103	Senator to go at one of these things, to do an investigation which lasts a month or two months or whatever is necessary to get the work done or to have one that goes on for years.
YOU1000000029_S0000104	like this whole whitewater situation has gone on for years with Senator
YOU1000000029_S0000106	Can we expect that to come up again?
YOU1000000029_S0000107	Well, what I hope is that we have a Howard Baker on the Democrat side, as they did during Watergate. A bipartisan Democrat will say, look, we've got to look into this and we've got to go at it in a
YOU1000000029_S0000109	I hope so.
YOU1000000029_S0000110	I'll take you up on that. John Burrow, are you ready to play the role of Howard Baker and ask Bill Clinton what did he know and when did he know it about this laundered money from Indonesia?
YOU1000000029_S0000111	Bob, the problem is bipartisan. It's a bipartisan problem. Just yesterday, one person who was a supporter and worked for the Dole campaign confessed to making a $120,000 illegal contribution.
YOU1000000029_S0000112	I think the American people want us to look at some new campaign financial reform. John McCain, I think, is a leader on this issue, along with our Democratic side. That's what I think the people want. They want to make sure we do it right in the future.
YOU1000000029_S0000114	been a great deal of time.
YOU1000000029_S0000115	uh... just harping on what has happened in the past because it's been both sides and both sides have to clean up our act
YOU1000000029_S0000116	Well, John, as a realistic Louisiana politician, and you're one of the best of them, would you agree with me that a lot is at stake tonight for the president?
YOU1000000029_S0000117	on who controls the congressional machinery of the House and the Senate as to what kind of investigation there's going to be?
YOU1000000029_S0000118	Well,
YOU1000000035_S0000000	Hello and welcome to Animal Watch and this week we're talking the Turkish Kangal dog.
YOU1000000035_S0000002	There are a few breeds in the world who are known as formidable flock guardians.
YOU1000000035_S0000003	one being the feared and immense Kangol.
YOU1000000035_S0000005	claim to have the size, strength and ferocity to kill wolves in order to protect their flock.
YOU1000000035_S0000006	claimed to have the speed and launch power of a Ferrari.
YOU1000000035_S0000007	and suggested to have a bite force that is the most powerful out of every dog breed there is.
YOU1000000035_S0000009	Possessing an old and ancient history that goes back thousands of years.
YOU1000000035_S0000010	Some stories even suggest that actual wolf blood runs through their veins.
YOU1000000035_S0000012	But what is the truth? Are these huge herding dogs mindless killers or simply protectors of the innocent?
YOU1000000035_S0000014	Are they suitable as pets or best left as working dogs?
YOU1000000035_S0000015	And can they really kill a wolf? Or are they simply effective wolf deterrents?
YOU1000000035_S0000016	Today I'm visiting Carl Westfield in the UK, who is guardian of several kangals.
YOU1000000035_S0000017	And also one of the UK's top Kangal experts, Sheila Reid. In order to find out just what the temperament is,
YOU1000000035_S0000018	of one of these incredible looking dogs and also the truth.
YOU1000000035_S0000020	My call.
YOU1000000035_S0000021	Oh hi Annika!
YOU1000000035_S0000022	Nice to meet you!
YOU1000000035_S0000023	These are my can gows.
YOU1000000035_S0000024	Wow, look at him! Hello!
YOU1000000035_S0000025	This is Dave here.
YOU1000000035_S0000026	Day
YOU1000000035_S0000027	Yes, this is Dave.
YOU1000000035_S0000029	What's our favourite gaggle? I love it.
YOU1000000035_S0000030	It's amazing.
YOU1000000035_S0000032	It's really always beautiful isn't it?
YOU1000000035_S0000033	This is Dave and Kajaz
YOU1000000035_S0000034	That's a pretty name.
YOU1000000035_S0000035	I met Carl's two Kangals and the first thing that hit me was how lovely they were. Really affectionate and welcoming of strangers.
YOU1000000035_S0000036	Dave, his male Kangal, just wanted to be petted and loved to roll over and fall down in my lap.
YOU1000000035_S0000037	The two dogs had an obvious roving curiosity and Cole mentioned that he preferred to keep them leashed
YOU1000000035_S0000038	as their protective streak would kick in like a Ferrari from 0 to 80 miles per hour if a passing dog went by in the distance.
YOU1000000035_S0000039	Even though they had just been introduced to this field, apparently it would now have become their territory to protect and keep safe.
YOU1000000035_S0000040	Well Carl, these are beautiful beautiful dogs and it's the first time I've ever met a Kangal dog. You get this sort of idea when people go on about them being
YOU1000000035_S0000041	you know, sort of these ferocious plot guardians and that, that they're going to be somewhat unfriendly, but they've been so sweet and lovely.
YOU1000000035_S0000042	They are with people and families and especially children.
YOU1000000035_S0000043	A good Kanga is completely solid temperament, basically calm until roused.
YOU1000000035_S0000044	They can be confrontational if they consider that there's something outside of what they perceive to be their flock.
YOU1000000035_S0000045	their family, their guardian, their area. If anything kind of threatens that, then yes, they do come alive.
YOU1000000035_S0000046	It's very, very well documented that they are exceptional with children, literally because for centuries they've had to grow up in villages.
YOU1000000035_S0000047	Yes.
YOU1000000035_S0000048	with children running around and they can't show any undue aggression otherwise they would be fiercely treated.
YOU1000000035_S0000049	How tall do the Kangals stand?
YOU1000000035_S0000050	There's quite a disparity with what you think is a massive Kangal versus what is the reality of a Kangal.
YOU1000000035_S0000051	I believe. If you do any googling or if you look at YouTube or pictures
YOU1000000035_S0000052	or wherever you sometimes see massive dogs, generally originating out of Turkey, that are coming in at 80, 90, 100 kilos.
YOU1000000035_S0000053	These are just not Kangal, they're not a working dog, they couldn't do a day's work.
YOU1000000035_S0000054	These are more of the proper working tangles that are out there with the shepherds.
YOU1000000035_S0000056	There is big, there is small within a standard, anywhere between 28 and 32 approximately.
YOU1000000035_S0000057	How heavy are the Kangals approximately?
YOU1000000035_S0000058	Oh, anywhere between about 90 and 130 pounds.
YOU1000000035_S0000059	Let's just quickly talk about Dave's ears here because I know people comment a lot about cropped ears.
YOU1000000035_S0000060	In the United Kingdom we don't crop ears, it's illegal. He's an import and of course when they come in from working lines they've been cropped.
YOU1000000035_S0000061	when they've been very, very young. And of course, little Dave here is an import, so he's not being cropped here in the UK.
YOU1000000035_S0000062	and Carl certainly doesn't prop any of the ears. And of course, as you can see here on the female, this is what their ears are supposed to look like.
YOU1000000035_S0000063	So what is it like having a Kangal in your house?
YOU1000000035_S0000064	For such a big dogs, sometimes you can't hear them, you don't know where they are, and yet they know.
YOU1000000035_S0000065	They constantly watch. They'll pretty much sleep with one eye open so they'll know exactly what's happening. Anything out of the unusual, they'll let you know.
YOU1000000035_S0000066	yeah so if somebody rings the doorbell will they fly up?
YOU1000000035_S0000067	Yeah, they want to know what it is.
YOU1000000035_S0000068	How about if somebody's walking a dog past your window?
YOU1000000035_S0000069	Yeah, then they will... Yes, they will go mental. They will go mental.
YOU1000000035_S0000071	If I came to greet you in your house, would they still treat me exactly the same?
YOU1000000035_S0000072	Exactly the same.
YOU1000000035_S0000073	So just lovely dogs actually, really really lovely dogs that have got a bit of a rubbish reputation I've got to say on some of the clips I've been seeing.
YOU1000000035_S0000074	What is the life expectancy for a Kangal? Because they're quite large dogs but they're healthy.
YOU1000000035_S0000075	Yes, they are very, very healthy. It's normally fair to say that the bigger the dog, the less long they live.
YOU1000000035_S0000076	But that is quite unusual with these because I've known dogs that are 14, 15, 16 years old.
YOU1000000035_S0000077	That's a really good age. That's a good age. Healthy age.
YOU1000000035_S0000078	They live and work for a very long time.
YOU1000000035_S0000079	It's an unbelievable coat, I mean if I rub my hands up here it's dense, be it the undercoat... hello Dave!
YOU1000000035_S0000081	so sweet.
YOU1000000035_S0000083	It's so thick and dense isn't it and like the undercoat is the same length as the guard has isn't it?
YOU1000000035_S0000084	and you can see how they can keep so warm up in the mountains. I mean how cold does it get in Turkey?
YOU1000000035_S0000086	In the winters it's got to be minus 30.
YOU1000000035_S0000087	It must be somewhere like that. And of course they crop the ears out there because they can get frostbite and one of the first things to go is the ears.
YOU1000000035_S0000088	as well of course if they come into a confrontation with a wolf, a wolf will latch on to anything that's hanging off, so like the ears. This is the only colour they come in that I presume.
YOU1000000035_S0000089	What colour is this called?
YOU1000000035_S0000090	It's fawn with a black mask.
YOU1000000035_S0000091	And it's a very similar colour to a chesus isn't it? That's why you said they sometimes get muddled up.
YOU1000000035_S0000092	Yeah, there's that and of course they have a similar Akita tail.
YOU1000000035_S0000094	they're not rambunctious or clumsy or anything like that they're just very calm
YOU1000000035_S0000095	You could have quite a small child with them and they're not going to jump on them or scratch them. They seem very, very relaxed to me. These dogs are very, very aloof.
YOU1000000035_S0000096	and they're very independent. If you let them off the lead and they see something, you were saying they could just literally go.
YOU1000000035_S0000097	Yeah, they will, always on a leash. You've got to be quite a brave person to let your Kangal run loose.
YOU1000000035_S0000098	It might be fair to say that if you get recall from your Kangal, you'll go down in history.
YOU1000000035_S0000100	when they go it's gosh yeah pull they really pull
YOU1000000035_S0000101	They have greater strength than what they seem to be in their size.
YOU1000000035_S0000102	You've got to be fairly young and agile and fit and strong to have one of these dogs.
YOU1000000035_S0000103	a fenced garden.
YOU1000000035_S0000104	fence garden because you're saying your boy here is a jumper.
YOU1000000035_S0000105	They're also very good diggers. They will dig under fences to get out.
YOU1000000035_S0000106	I think the digging comes back from in summertime
YOU1000000035_S0000107	In summer time they'll dig for a cool shade, cool area.
YOU1000000035_S0000108	And then in the winter time they go down in the slowing, it's exactly like a wolf will do that too. What do they eat?
YOU1000000035_S0000109	What do they eat? Mine eat fresh meat, fresh meat of biscuits or kibble or anything
YOU1000000035_S0000111	that I've got for them. They survive on very little actually. It's not true to say that they're big dogs and you've got to feed them 2-3-4 pounds of meat a day.
YOU1000000035_S0000112	No, they survive on quite a small amount of food.
YOU1000000035_S0000113	Maybe that's because of their breeding and their having to be up in the mountains.
YOU1000000035_S0000115	Later that week I dropped by to meet a very special lady indeed, Sheila Reid, respected across the UK for her expertise in the Kangal breed.
YOU1000000035_S0000116	Both her and her husband Michael had kept Kangals for decades now and had travelled out to Turkey many times to source dogs from working lines.
YOU1000000035_S0000117	If there was anyone who knew the Kangal better, then it would be her.
YOU1000000035_S0000118	We fell in love with the braid.
YOU1000000035_S0000120	Our old dog had died and we just wanted a natural dog. We went to see a lady called Mrs Betty Marshall.
YOU1000000035_S0000121	and she brought out her dog called Fenner. He stood on his back legs and he put his paws on my shoulders.
YOU1000000035_S0000123	and it looked me in the eye.
YOU1000000035_S0000125	and it looked right into my soul.
YOU1000000035_S0000127	And that was it.
YOU1000000035_S0000129	The Turkish people will tell you that they came with them as they moved up through into Turkey. They've been used for thousands and thousands of years.
YOU1000000035_S0000130	and it is their role to protect whatever it is that they live with. That's what they do naturally.
YOU1000000035_S0000131	If you go into Turkey and you go into the villages you'll see the old dogs and if they're no longer fit
YOU1000000035_S0000132	you know, and young out with the flock. They actually stay in the villages and when the children start to wander off
YOU1000000035_S0000133	you'll actually see the old dogs go and heave themselves to their feet but they will go off with the children.
YOU1000000035_S0000134	To ensure that the children are never alone and they are their guardian. So they don't march up and down being aggressive.
YOU1000000035_S0000135	They just wander quietly along, making sure the children are safe. Certainly, the Kangal dog couldn't kill a wolf without any problem at all.
YOU1000000035_S0000136	If you watch the Kangal dogs when they're young puppies, their mother teaches them in play and they will use their shoulders to charge.
YOU1000000035_S0000137	They don't always win. We had a very, very sad story. We went out on a vaccination programme in 2003, I think it was.
YOU1000000035_S0000138	One day we went up to the top of the mountain to this village first and there were only three puppies.
YOU1000000035_S0000139	And that was because the previous week there was a big, big pack of wolves that had come into the village in the middle of the night.
YOU1000000035_S0000140	and the males had gone out and what had happened is they'd gone into attack mode with the dwarves.
YOU1000000035_S0000141	The wolves basically were winning.
YOU1000000035_S0000143	So the people of the village got their burning staves and gone out. But the mother of these puppies had been in a shed with the puppies.
YOU1000000035_S0000144	when she could hear that things were going badly, because it is usually the bitch that kills the wolves, not the males. She'd broken free.
YOU1000000035_S0000146	and left the puppies locked in a safe place and gone out. So between her and the villagers, the wolves were chased away.
YOU1000000035_S0000147	but all of the males were dead. But she was severely damaged. They do take enormous care of their dogs.
YOU1000000035_S0000148	and they worked very hard on her but unfortunately she didn't survive and all they'd got left were these three puppies and the villagers were absolutely heartbroken.
YOU1000000035_S0000149	but the Turks don't recognise any dog called an Anatolian Shepherd Dog.
YOU1000000035_S0000150	To them, the word Anatolian Shepherd, they don't accept the word Anatolian because that's just a plateau in Turkey. It's a nothingness.
YOU1000000035_S0000151	It was a word that was taken up by the Americans to give it a name.
YOU1000000035_S0000152	And basically it's a word that covers any big dog that comes from Turkey. Any dog over 24 inches that comes out of Turkey.
YOU1000000035_S0000153	So it can be any colour, any coat length, anything really. Whereas that Karmgarl dog is a particular type.
YOU1000000035_S0000154	If you look at an Anatolian Shepherd dog, some of them look like Kangal dogs because a lot of them might have in their background a grandfather or a grandmother.
YOU1000000035_S0000156	They're not a dog for somebody who wants a dog that they can wander down the road and go to the local park and let them off for a week to play with all the other dogs.
YOU1000000035_S0000157	They'd be fine when they were puppies, but what would happen is gradually that park would become theirs. If they went there every day or once a week, gradually as they grew up.
YOU1000000035_S0000158	that would be their park. And so they would consider that everybody within that park were people who needed to abide by certain behaviour.
YOU1000000035_S0000159	patterns, civilized behavior patterns. If some stupid dog comes up to it growling and snapping and snarling and biting at its face,
YOU1000000035_S0000161	A Kangaroo dog will just...
YOU1000000035_S0000163	Do dog behaviour and it will sound completely statue-like, which is dog language for your behaviour is unacceptable, please stop.
YOU1000000035_S0000164	and if that doesn't work he will follow through.
YOU1000000035_S0000166	in animal behaviour patterns.
YOU1000000035_S0000167	until it gets to the point where he has to do what animal behaviour insists that he must do, which is to pick it up and give it a good thumping.
YOU1000000035_S0000168	which is not acceptable in today's modern world. In today's modern world that will make him a dangerous dog, which he doesn't understand.
YOU1000000035_S0000169	because as far as he's concerned he's followed all the patterns. You know I've tried, I've been very civilised, I've said
YOU1000000035_S0000170	don't do that, I've said I told you not to do that. I've followed all the behaviour lines.
YOU1000000035_S0000172	It isn't just physical strength. You need them to know what you want them to do.
YOU1000000035_S0000173	When we had our first dogs, they knew that I didn't want them to behave in a certain way at a certain place. What they did know was...
YOU1000000035_S0000174	They had somewhere where they could do that. Always our dogs have had somewhere where they could guard.
YOU1000000035_S0000175	Our dogs here, we've got a bride away at the side, they guard. They run up and down and they shout and they scream if anybody goes by. That's what they do.
YOU1000000035_S0000176	When we go out from here, they know that that behaviour is not acceptable.
YOU1000000035_S0000177	We do not have a dog barking and growling and screaming in the car and we make that clear from an early age.
YOU1000000035_S0000179	They're not a dog that goes around with their sleeves rolled up looking for trouble. And they should not be like that, and that is not what somebody should be wanting.
YOU1000000035_S0000180	They're not aggressive. What they are is they are there to take care of you.
YOU1000000035_S0000182	They are my heart and soul and they will give you their heart and their soul. They don't hold back ever. There's no half ways. They're an all or nothing dog.
YOU1000000035_S0000184	and that's the trouble with me, I'm an all or nothing person.
YOU1000000035_S0000185	And that's what I like about them.
YOU1000000035_S0000187	I was deeply moved by Sheila's stories and found out information I did not previously know, such as there being varying types of Kangol.
YOU1000000035_S0000188	Some larger, some more large-headed, some with more toes, and some far more aggressive than others.
YOU1000000035_S0000189	What was clear though was her deep unwavering love and respect of this breed. A breed that she was keen to not have misrepresented.
YOU1000000035_S0000190	A breed that would love and look after you with its soul and one that she wanted to be embraced by the world.
YOU1000000035_S0000191	She backed up my conclusion that a wolf can kill a Kangal, but equally if the conditions were right, a Kangal could kill a wolf.
YOU1000000035_S0000192	The walls of Turkey and the surrounding areas are much smaller than North American timber walls, and this small size would equate for why they are killed from time to time.
YOU1000000035_S0000193	But equally it was clear that wolves regularly kill the Kangals. However, what was most important was the dog's role.
YOU1000000035_S0000194	As if more flock guardians were used the world around
YOU1000000035_S0000195	then there would be less licensed wolf culls, as farmers could then protect their sheep in the fair and natural way.
YOU1000000035_S0000196	allowing wolves to coexist in the lands they all once roamed before industrial farming.
YOU1000000035_S0000197	Sheila also nicely cleared up the Kangal vs Anatolian Shepherd debate and explained why these two dog breeds are certainly not the same.

YOU1000000038_S0000001	Thank you for joining us, I'm Spencer Tillis.
YOU1000000038_S0000002	And I'm Giselle Espinales.
YOU1000000038_S0000003	And this is the Delmarva Sports Insider. We are your ticket to highlights and the behind the scenes.
YOU1000000038_S0000005	all your teams up and down Delmarva, as well as some of your favorite pro teams in DC, Baltimore, and Philly.
YOU1000000038_S0000006	We will have exclusive interviews with coaches, current and former players, plus we want to engage you.
YOU1000000038_S0000007	The Viewer. Tell us what games and teams you want to hear about in upcoming episodes.
YOU1000000038_S0000008	That's right. We want to be a part of your team and we want you to be a part of ours. Delmarva Sports Insider starts now.
YOU1000000038_S0000009	In this week's episode we head up to Del Mar and check in on the wildcats.
YOU1000000038_S0000011	very first scrimmage.
YOU1000000038_S0000012	And I wouldn't be surprised if Ravens head coach John Harbaugh had his own fantasy football draft. Regular season is right around the corner. We'll let you know our picks.
YOU1000000038_S0000013	And we'll head down to Snow Hill and get our first look at this year's Eagles team as they took on North Dorchester.
YOU1000000038_S0000014	But we begin today with a team right here on Delmarva that has some high expectations heading into the football season.
YOU1000000038_S0000015	Queen Anne's now they held their first scrimmage this year on Friday against Saint Mary's Riken. Now the Lions finished last year with a eight and three record overall.
YOU1000000038_S0000016	before eventually being bounced in the state tournament in the first round. Now they did lose a few guys from that team, but they bring back a lot of key players and it's not just about what they're going to do here early on.
YOU1000000038_S0000017	But it's about putting in the work that will pay off towards the end of the year.
YOU1000000038_S0000018	It's definitely a work in progress, really. Most of our line's going to be really young. We're going to be a bunch of pretty much sophomores and juniors.
YOU1000000038_S0000019	So it's just pretty much getting their confidence up and then everything will just kind of mesh together after that.
YOU1000000038_S0000021	Spencer, you know the Lions are one of the teams that every other team in the Bayside North Division actually circles on their calendar, so they mean business.
YOU1000000038_S0000022	But like this QB said, this is a young team and they have to find their comfort level in their scrimmage on Friday. The Lions had some mistakes on both sides of the ball.
YOU1000000038_S0000023	The program itself has not a won a regional championship in a couple years and for this team to get back to the top of the football chain
YOU1000000038_S0000024	They need to feel comfortable, especially since they have some new faces. The Lions have the athletic ability, but we know football is not just about athletic ability. Spencer, it's all about the mental game as well.
YOU1000000038_S0000025	I think you're right too. I mean, you look at, they did have a couple mistakes early on, but I actually really liked what I saw from this team. And the fact is, you're going to have that early on in your first few screen images. Those are why those are there. To work through that, get yourself better.
YOU1000000038_S0000026	And what I really was impressed with was Bradley. How calm and composed he was throughout that interview and throughout the game.
YOU1000000038_S0000027	And if you can get that from your senior leadership, especially when it's that quarterback, you know you're going to have a pretty good chance of winning a lot of ballgames, especially in the high school games.
YOU1000000038_S0000028	So I think they actually have a pretty good thing here moving forward.
YOU1000000038_S0000030	been there with four years with the team.
YOU1000000038_S0000031	Alright it was scrimmage Saturday in Delaware. Sussex Central Knights played host to the Woodbridge Raiders and the Stephen Decatur Seahawks.
YOU1000000038_S0000032	The Knights were doing this all day, controlling the game at the line of scrimmage, that's the quarterback running down and really having their way with the other teams.
YOU1000000038_S0000033	And the Seahawks had questions on who would be their number one running back, but they got a few contributions from a few guys. And look at that guy just go! Committing. And now the Woodbridge showed their ability to make the big play, especially this guy.
YOU1000000038_S0000035	I think it was the quarterback scrimmages, especially for the Raiders.
YOU1000000038_S0000036	That was a good question.
YOU1000000038_S0000037	This group has actually worked super hard in camp. We have tightened the bolts down a little bit in camp from last year and previous years.
YOU1000000038_S0000038	and push the kids pretty hard this year. I gotta tell you, they responded. We have good numbers out and the kids, we're working hard.
YOU1000000038_S0000039	And you can see it in her play.
YOU1000000038_S0000041	No, these are always good when you have those three-team scrimmages or four-team. It's an opportunity to really gauge each other against some good competition. And the thing that really stood out for me was why we went to their first couple practices and there was a lot of questions as to what running back was going to take over for them moving forward.
YOU1000000038_S0000042	And the thing is, it looks like they have multiple guys that can do it. I mean, they had a couple guys out there that were really running the ball pretty hard.
YOU1000000038_S0000043	And the fact is, I mean Stephen Decatur that is, they had guys that they were handing the ball off to, running hard downhill. And they also had a guy that was about 250 pounds and he was laying guys out. I mean, he was picking up yards. You want to talk about falling forward to get the first down.
YOU1000000038_S0000044	He was definitely getting that done out there for him, Giselle. And I feel like moving forward, they got a good thing going there. It's always nice when you have a couple guys you can hand the ball to.
YOU1000000038_S0000045	I think with any team, whether it was the Seahawks, the Raiders or the Knights, the best part about scrimmage is to be able to finally play against someone else.
YOU1000000038_S0000046	I know this scrimmage helped each team get a good measure on how their offense and defense will really perform. No matter who's on the field, it's all about who's going to step up under pressure and make the big plays, whether it's a scrimmage or the first game of the season.
YOU1000000038_S0000047	And as Coach Knox said, the cream usually comes to the top.
YOU1000000038_S0000049	And Seifert, they hosted a four-team scrimmage yesterday, which included Parkside, Jameson, Bennett and Colonel Richardson. Now a strong play for both teams this thing.
YOU1000000038_S0000050	And speaking of strong plays, check out this run here by TJ Hayward. I mean, just knocking guys out of his way, barreling downhill. Colonel Richardson was moving the ball as well in this thing. Their quarterback sneaks here in the middle up the crease and
YOU1000000038_S0000051	3
YOU1000000038_S0000052	Seaford, they got it done on defense. I think that's gonna be one more area where they're improved a lot this year made a couple interceptions and it was good to see out of them.
YOU1000000038_S0000053	Well, we were ready. We were hyped for it. And we all came in with the right intensity. So we knew this was the first chance we got to actually put full pads on and play against somebody else. So we were ready for it.
YOU1000000038_S0000054	I think it went very well for us. Still things to improve on, but coming out today and seeing what we had, and we did a great job out here. Everybody executed well.
YOU1000000038_S0000055	You know Spencer actually being out there on Saturday felt like each team was actually playing for a championship One team that stood out from the rest of them were the Rams and I mean their running game was on point Finding the holes evading defenders. They could do no wrong in my eyes
YOU1000000038_S0000056	On the other hand, one of the teams that made some mistakes on both sides of the ball were the Blue Jays. I spoke to Coach Darling, he said his team is too selfish right now and is trying to get them to be a more cohesive unit and you know, the scrimmage is actually going to help them get to that better direction.
YOU1000000038_S0000057	Absolutely, and it's always tough to that's his first year at the program. So moving forward you kind of need to get that senior leadership and kind of establish yourself So I'm sure it would be fine down the stretch but early on that's always tough to go But I think that really impressed me was Parkside I mean they had some guys down the field that were definitely making some plays at the ball and
YOU1000000038_S0000058	That passing game looks legit and they have a couple guys too that I feel like you're gonna watch out for this year. And at the high school level, I was a little concerned that they wouldn't be able to have the playmakers and the time to get it out there.
YOU1000000038_S0000059	But they found them in space. And if they can do that throughout the year, I mean, this is going to be a team you're definitely going to watch moving forward, Gisela. They are a quality, quality program.
YOU1000000038_S0000060	3
YOU1000000038_S0000061	or email us at 47abc.com or you can email us at sports at wndt.com. That is, let us know what games you want us to go to and also check out our polls online.
YOU1000000038_S0000062	And don't you just love football? So much of it! And we are not done yet. Right after the break, the Del Mar Wildcats taking on the Tribe Y-High. Keep it locked right here.
YOU1000000038_S0000063	How you doing? I'm Matt Griffith from Easton High School, head varsity football coach. You're watching the Delmarva Sports Insider.
YOU1000000038_S0000065	welcome back what we are still talking simple but i'll tell you that special special segment for this one
YOU1000000038_S0000066	We have our own Trey Miles who's a Y-High alum had a chance to talk to his old coach about the program's direction. Trey, were you tempted to put on some gear and do you miss it?
YOU1000000038_S0000068	Well I don't exactly miss the two-a-day practices or the indescribable scent of that locker room. But of course I do miss the game.
YOU1000000038_S0000069	So I stopped by practice and chatted with my former JV coach, now varsity head coach, Pat McGlinchey, to see exactly what Y-High will need to improve upon to return to the Bayside dominance.
YOU1000000038_S0000070	Got my jersey on right now. It's been seven years. Can you believe that coach?
YOU1000000038_S0000071	Yeah, I can't believe it. It feels like yesterday.
YOU1000000038_S0000072	3 and 7 was a kind of down year last year according to program standards. What will change that this year?
YOU1000000038_S0000073	The biggest difference between last year and this year is going to be team unity. We stressed it in the weight room all offseason. As soon as the season was over, I realized a lot of the mistakes that I made as a head football coach
YOU1000000038_S0000074	I'm going to put a lot of the blame on myself. It is on my shoulders. I felt like our team wasn't together. They were more about playing for themselves. We had great athletes last year.
YOU1000000038_S0000075	and we just didn't come together and play together.
YOU1000000038_S0000076	My man Nelson Brown will be featured in this offense. Talk about him and why he excels at what he does.
YOU1000000038_S0000077	Nelson Brown is just one of those phenomenal athletes. He's not an athlete that comes around all the time. Nelson's being looked at by Division I AA football schools.
YOU1000000038_S0000078	He's a scholarship kid and we're waiting on that first scholarship. Morgan State's been really looking hard at him. But, you know, beside that, he is just, he goes out there and he's the ultra competitor.
YOU1000000038_S0000079	He doesn't like being on the sideline, whether it's in practice or during a game. So in a game, we're looking at him really carrying the load this year and really being the running back that he can be.
YOU1000000038_S0000080	Talk about a newcomer that you're expecting, that you're really expecting to put some things on tape and really have a good time for you this year.
YOU1000000038_S0000081	I would say the newcomer that I'm looking forward to the most is Raekwon McCarter. He's just at every single thing that we could offer. He goes to the off-season training, the weight room, the beach.
YOU1000000038_S0000082	Wherever we are doing training, he is there.
YOU1000000038_S0000083	You got a new guy here at corner, Keiondre Causton, who when we saw him at the Bente camp, honestly in my eyes, he was the best corner there. Talk about him and what this young defense will bring to the table.
YOU1000000038_S0000084	Yeah, our D-backs this year are pretty much all new. Like you said, Keiondre is one of those guys who's going to try to shut you down a line of scrimmage.
YOU1000000038_S0000085	He's very strong, he's little, but he's very strong and he's very fast and, you know, we're really excited about all of them.
YOU1000000038_S0000087	Well, Saturday, WIHAI made the trip to Wildcat Country to take on six-time state champion Delmar in a little preseason football action.
YOU1000000038_S0000088	There's that man Nelson Brown. He was out on Saturday with a shoulder bruise. Just precautionary. He told me he expects to practice on Monday. There's another star Shane Leatherberry and he is a veteran and natural born leader of the Wildcats. I expect those young guys there to look up for him.
YOU1000000038_S0000089	We know that
YOU1000000038_S0000091	but check out what he does on defense.
YOU1000000038_S0000092	Gets the pick right there. He's out on the island by himself, and this guy will be a natural born leader. One thing I really liked about Waihai was their defensive line. That right there is Terez Savage breaking through and dropping Leatherberry for the sack.
YOU1000000038_S0000093	I'm telling you, him and Mel Morris are two studs on the defensive line. This play right here by this young man, Raquan McCarter, is just a fabulous play. Look at him take it down through the middle and get those defenders out of his way. That's just a filthy move. Excuse me, thank you for a touchdown.
YOU1000000038_S0000094	This kid's gonna be a stud not to be outdone Delmar Junior DeJord Brown takes the handoff straight up the middle 60 yards out and he didn't even get touched folks. He's got some burners. He had a great scrimmage as well.
YOU1000000038_S0000095	And for Del Mar coach Dave Hearn, he knows that the preseason is all about figuring his team out.
YOU1000000038_S0000096	The first week you're hoping just to keep everybody healthy and that first scrimmage, that's what we did today. And to make sure that we've learned something. But if you haven't got players that are what you thought, especially the new guys, the ones you're talking about.
YOU1000000038_S0000097	then you may have to make adjustments or then you can figure out what do they need. And so then we'll make adjustments ourselves because we're not just going to plug along if we're struggling in a particular area. We'll try to make some modifications.
YOU1000000038_S0000099	Well, if you know anything about Delmar football, you know Coach Hearn will have that team ready, whether he has all freshmen or all seniors. There's a reason why he's a four-time state champion there.
YOU1000000038_S0000100	Still to come, the Raiders of Woodbridge on the field for some field hockey. We'll tell you what they're doing to improve upon that 9-6 record from just a year ago. Don't go anywhere.
YOU1000000038_S0000102	My name is David Wells, inside linebacker for James and Bennett, and you're watching Demo, or Sports Insider.
YOU1000000038_S0000104	Welcome back. Well, the fall sports season it is officially underway and that means just one thing to sell. It is time for some field hockey. I mean Woodbridge, they got their first taste of the preseason action on Wednesday when they hosted a five team scrimmage.
YOU1000000038_S0000105	Head Coach Wheatley's team will be trying to make it to the state tournament after coming up with just one game short a year ago, finishing with a 9-6 record. That right there was Sarah Davis putting on the moves from way outside and scoring it. Just a beautiful goal.
YOU1000000038_S0000106	And then just a few minutes later, the Raiders, they were right back at it. They found the net one more time. This one was from Brady Keeler with the honors with a beautiful slap shot.
YOU1000000038_S0000107	Our goal is to get into the tournament and get really far into the tournament. And I don't know, we've been talking about it for a few years, so I'm just really excited and it's really important to me.
YOU1000000038_S0000109	set those expectations.
YOU1000000038_S0000110	Yeah, definitely when you raise it up there. And the fact is I looked at this team and I we went in I was talking with coach really afterwards. They had they knew they're gonna be able to score the ball. They knew they knew they had a good opportunity of being a very high scoring team, but they didn't realize how good they're gonna be defensively and they definitely showed that in the scrimmage.
YOU1000000038_S0000111	I feel like they're going to be a quality program, but what scares me is the fact that they only have three seniors and they're going to be relying on a lot of unproven teams. That doesn't mean that they can't do it, but the fact is those guys haven't had the minutes yet. They haven't proven they can play at this level, so there's still some question marks moving forward.
YOU1000000038_S0000112	I mean you're right having only three seniors is a little worrisome but sometimes you have to look past that number and see the group as a whole and you know growing pains are actually normal in high school and this team looks ready to step it up to the next level.
YOU1000000038_S0000113	Like the coach said, it's about avoiding mistakes and learning from each game, which is key in any sport.
YOU1000000038_S0000114	Yeah, absolutely. And by the way, congratulations to Coach Wheatley. She actually just got married a couple weeks ago.
YOU1000000038_S0000116	And the volleyball season, well that's here as well. Several teams are taking part in their first scrimmages of the year. On Thursday, Snow Hill welcomed North Dorchester to town. The Snow Hill Eagles will have some high expectations coming in this year.
YOU1000000038_S0000117	And as for Dorchester, well, it's a success even having a team on the court. I mean, the Eagles, this is the first time they've had a program reopening up this year. Now, overall, though, both teams were pretty pleased with what they saw from their team.
YOU1000000038_S0000118	Really we're trying to work on the fundamentals, the basics again, trying to improve some serving, some net play, and really trying to put together an offense that's going to be a little bit more aggressive than we were last year.
YOU1000000038_S0000119	We've got 15 girls out here. We kind of tried to go with our most athletic girls and just kind of work with it from there. But they're very excited. Coach Jackson and I are very excited. So it's always cool to have a new program, give the kids some more experiences.
YOU1000000038_S0000120	She is absolutely right about that. I was thinking about that. What a great experience for these guys. I mean, they're going into the season. They're not going to have too much pressure. I mean, no one's really expecting them to make a run as far as wins.
YOU1000000038_S0000121	but just the fact to be a part of a brand new program, to get out there on the court and have a great time with your friends and to learn a new sport and be competitive with it. I mean, this is something they'll be able to say for the rest of their lives, that they were a part of the very first team there.
YOU1000000038_S0000122	And I really, I mean, I can't imagine what that feeling must be like.
YOU1000000038_S0000123	But you should, that sounds like us. It's like the beginning. We started from the beginning. I remember when I was a part of a water polo team at my high school that was only in its second year. It's all about patience when you're in a startup program and the Eagles will learn so much of that this season.
YOU1000000038_S0000124	And Spencer, one of the things they have to also see is being able to build that roster and see who's actually going to be able to perform well on the court.
YOU1000000038_S0000125	Yeah, absolutely. Moving forward, that'll be a great test of just what this team is going to have.
YOU1000000038_S0000126	Alright, and so many games on the Eastern Shore. Tell us which ones we should go to. Like our Facebook page, 47 ABC Sports. And after you do that, go follow us on our Twitter account, at 47 ABC Sports.
YOU1000000038_S0000127	And even if it's a selfie or a view at a sporting event, send us those too. You might see them in our next show.
YOU1000000038_S0000128	Yeah, absolutely. And we're going to take another quick commercial break, but don't go anywhere. We're going to talk a little fantasy football after the break. What players can make or break this year's team? We'll discuss.
YOU1000000038_S0000129	This is Monica Wheatley for the Woodbridge Field Hockey Team and you are watching the Delmarva Sports Insider.
YOU1000000038_S0000131	Welcome back. We're going to talk a little fantasy football now, guys. And there's always that one guy that's flying under the radar that can totally change your team. Giselle, who you got this year?
YOU1000000038_S0000132	My sleeper pick is actually someone I went to high school with, T.Y. Hilton from the Colts, a wide receiver, and he was as impressive as Andrew Luck's number one option last season after the injury to Pro Kane Reggie Wayne.
YOU1000000038_S0000133	I mean just look at those stats from last season. Hilton had 1,083 yards and five touchdowns. He's speedy and sure. Wayne is coming back this season but I think Hilton will put up big numbers this season.
YOU1000000038_S0000134	and give me some major points that I need.
YOU1000000038_S0000135	Yeah. Well my sleeper. I did not go to high school with but I'm going with EJ manual. Man, you'll miss six games last season with an hyperextended knee, but he's got some serious weapons. Now CJ Spiller Fred Jack Jackson.
YOU1000000038_S0000136	They traded up in the draft for Sammy Watkins. He's a monster. They add Robert Woods and speedster Marquise Goodwin and they brought got Mike Williams on and I mean there's a lot of weapons there. A lot of young weapons but they're very talented. He's undrafted in most leagues, you know.
YOU1000000038_S0000137	So I think you can make a case to be a good sleeper pick. I definitely do. You can definitely get them late in the draft.
YOU1000000038_S0000138	I think there's a big reason why he's undrafted in most leagues. I'm sleeping on manual moving forward.
YOU1000000038_S0000139	But the guy I'm going with, I mean, Titans are always hard to find. I think Ladarius Green is going to have a big year for the Chargers in this year.
YOU1000000038_S0000140	I mean, he didn't exactly have amazing numbers last year. I get it, just 13 catches and three TDs. But he's starting to take more and more reps with the ones. Philip Rivers loves his tight ends, and I think he's going to get a lot of balls thrown his way this year.
YOU1000000038_S0000141	Oh, you think so?
YOU1000000038_S0000142	I think so.
YOU1000000038_S0000143	I know.
YOU1000000038_S0000144	Well, have you ever had someone let you down?
YOU1000000038_S0000145	Just when you needed them? Let's talk about the bus. The worst fantasy football thing that could ever happen is a bus.
YOU1000000038_S0000146	Who you guys going with today?
YOU1000000038_S0000147	Drumroll, I got Gronk, I know. Someone out there also has Rob Gronkowski as their bus. I know this guy's coming off an ACL injury and he's no Adrian Prevston, let's be real. The unlucky number here is 14 and no, that's not the number of touchdowns.
YOU1000000038_S0000148	he scored that's how many weeks of football he's missed due to injury. I understand that he's one of the top tight ends in the league when he was extremely healthy. Remember, extremely healthy. Scoring 42 touchdowns in 50 career regular season games.
YOU1000000038_S0000149	He's also had eight career surgeries. I just don't see the spark in Gronkowski. How much can he really physically overcome this season? The game is just getting even harder.
YOU1000000038_S0000150	I don't know, anytime you got Brady, I feel like you're gonna be alright.
YOU1000000038_S0000152	All right. Sorry, not sorry Eagles fans, but I'm going with Nick Foles. Y'all know what you're saying. Nick Foles had amazing numbers last season, which is exactly why I'm staying away from him. Teams now have film on them and they're prepared for Chip Kelly's offense.
YOU1000000038_S0000153	Plus he lost to Shawn Jackson. He looked lost when I was up there at Eagles camp guys, but so did all the other Eagles quarterbacks. But I'm not saying don't draft the Eagles, especially Shawn McCoy.
YOU1000000038_S0000154	But I don't think Foles is going to put up half the numbers he put up last year.
YOU1000000038_S0000155	So you just made a lot of people angry here.
YOU1000000038_S0000157	I definitely am going to stay away from though is Eric Decker. I mean, this guy is definitely going to cost some people from winning their leagues. He's going to dread on. I get it. I mean, he had some good numbers in Denver, but the fact is that offense is ridiculous there.
YOU1000000038_S0000158	And a number that you need to know is that guy dropped 30% of his catchable balls. I mean, he has not got good hands. He doesn't have good breakaway speed. And I just don't feel like anyone should go near him at all.
YOU1000000038_S0000160	next week when we bring in Chris Russell from ESPN 980 in DC to talk about the Redskins and coming up after the break one of our favorite segments, crazy catches, dives and stops, our plays of the week coming up. You won't want to miss it.
YOU1000000038_S0000161	My name is Tristan Harris, quarterback at Dover High, and you're watching Delmarva Sports Insider.
YOU1000000038_S0000163	Welcome back. Well, it's now time for my personal favorite segment. I can't wait.
YOU1000000038_S0000165	Blaze of the week, the top ones we got.
YOU1000000038_S0000166	Take a look, we've got some great ones here for you. Let's start off with a little Woodbridge football. Oh my goodness, that was one of the most nastiest in-out dribbles. One more look at this guy.
YOU1000000038_S0000167	Slow it down and look at this DB, that is just, his knee, his ankle, his leg, everything is just broken right there.
YOU1000000038_S0000169	Yeah, he's gonna be alright this year. Definitely gonna watch out for him.
YOU1000000038_S0000170	And we take it over to some Clippers and Colonel action. It's only a scrimmage, but why does they look like midseason form senior quarterback Jacob Larmore under pressure still able to find that receiver?
YOU1000000038_S0000171	Steven Sone, I mean, with a defender on him makes the incredible catch. He was in the air.
YOU1000000038_S0000173	gorgeous catch in my play with the other day will come from the scrimmage. I was at why high sophomore running back Rayquan McCarter gets a sweep off the right side.
YOU1000000038_S0000174	Watch these moves guys. One, two.
YOU1000000038_S0000176	Oh my goodness.
YOU1000000038_S0000178	That's the B button on the Xbox right there. That's a spin move. What a play for this young guy. I can't wait to see what he has up next for this this upcoming season.
YOU1000000038_S0000179	And so many plays and don't forget to look for us out on the field this week. On Wednesday we will be at Indian River for their football scrimmage against Hutchinson and then on Thursday we'll be at Parkside's volleyball match against Colonel Richardson
YOU1000000038_S0000180	and then next Saturday we'll also be checking out the Del Mar football for their scrimmage.
YOU1000000038_S0000181	That's all the time we've got for this week. Make sure to check in next week, same time, same place, right back here at 1130 AM.
YOU1000000038_S0000182	In the meantime, make sure you follow us all week for your scores, highlights and updates at 47 ABC Sports on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.
YOU1000000038_S0000183	Have a good day.
YOU1000000040_S0000000	We're in Istanbul, Turkey.
YOU1000000040_S0000001	the food culture here will blow your mind we're so excited to be filming a bunch of food videos
YOU1000000040_S0000002	Let's get food hunting.
YOU1000000040_S0000003	Istanbul has an exciting and vibrant food scene, this city's diverse heritage is reflected in its incredible food culture, in this five-part series we're going to show you some delicious local Turkish food
YOU1000000040_S0000004	eat where the locals eat. This is our third video of the series and we're hunting down the popular snack of Lamajun, eating a kebab drenched in browned butter
YOU1000000040_S0000005	and visiting a historic sweet shop for Turkey's famous Turkish delight you don't want to miss this video get ready for some mouth-watering food
YOU1000000040_S0000006	I'm Thomas.
YOU1000000040_S0000007	and I'm Sheena and we're Chasing a Plate
YOU1000000040_S0000008	we hope you're hungry, let's eat
YOU1000000040_S0000010	we're starting our food hunting day over on the Asian side of Istanbul and the first thing we are going to eat is a thing called lahmacun so lahmacun you'll often see described as Turkish pizza but it is nothing like it
YOU1000000040_S0000011	it has its really own unique identity and it is super delicious
YOU1000000040_S0000013	so this is lahmacun now I reckon it is called Turkish pizza because it's round, it's made up of dough and the dough has got some topping on it but it is really different in my opinion
YOU1000000040_S0000014	they take a small clump of dough and they roll that dough out until it's really thin, paper thin and then they smear it with a thin minced mixture of lamb, parsley, I think there's a little bit of chilli on there
YOU1000000040_S0000015	and then they pop it into a really blazing hot wood fired oven now you can see that the dough is just perfectly blistered and then it's got that whole minced meat mixture on the top
YOU1000000040_S0000016	but it's so thin that you can see like parts of the dough coming through so the way that it's served is it comes with fresh parsley and some lemon so what you do is you grab some parsley, pop it in the middle
YOU1000000040_S0000018	then give a little bit of squeeze of lemon over the top of it and then you take the whole thing and you roll it up so you wouldn't think that the dough is very pliable but it is
YOU1000000040_S0000019	it's like beautifully soft, all right let's give this thing a taste
YOU1000000040_S0000021	that is so good, it is beautiful, the dough is so soft but it has the perfect amount of crispiness, it's almost a little bit floury but in a pleasant way
YOU1000000040_S0000022	and the minced meat mixture, the lamb, it's got so much flavour and there's just enough on there, there's the perfect balance of meat and dog
YOU1000000040_S0000023	this is good, my initial bite didn't get any of that parsley in there so let's go for another one
YOU1000000040_S0000025	that fresh parsley imparts such a beautiful vibrant flavour and then that tiny squeeze and hint of lemon juice adds an acidity to that bite oh man this is so good
YOU1000000040_S0000027	that was a great start to this food hunting day don't let anyone tell you that dish is like a pizza it's nothing like a pizza, stands out on its own for its own reasons and it is incredible we're on to find some more food now
YOU1000000040_S0000029	our next stop is taking us down near the coast and how beautiful is this city so I'm gonna show you some shots of this beautiful coastline before we start eating again
YOU1000000040_S0000031	I'm really excited about our next stop we're gonna be eating a thing called an Iskandar kebab now kebab is like a common term for meat that is fashioned onto a skewer and then grilled and this kebab is made up of a plate of meat and
YOU1000000040_S0000032	tomato sauce, creamy yogurt and brown butter it looks insane and the restaurant which is just over there
YOU1000000040_S0000033	is owned and operated by the family of the man who created this kebab way back in 1867 so there's a real history
YOU1000000040_S0000034	with this restaurant, let's go and eat
YOU1000000040_S0000036	our kebab has just been delivered and this is unreal and it's pretty different to what you expect when you get some form of kebab here in Turkey so normally there's bread around the outside but in this case there's a little bit of bread hiding underneath
YOU1000000040_S0000037	but it's all about the meat so all of this lamb is just piled on top and then to go with it a ginormous dollop of yogurt
YOU1000000040_S0000038	some grilled chilli peppers and then some fresh tomato and on top of that meat is browned butter so that's gonna just make it super rich and creamy so they bring over the big pan of browned butter
YOU1000000040_S0000039	pour it all over the meat and you can actually see the tomato sauce that Sheena mentioned as well so you can see the slight orange colour in there and then look at the butter just glistening on that meat so
YOU1000000040_S0000040	let's just grab some meat, get some bread from under there as well, a whole lot of yogurt and get right on in
YOU1000000040_S0000042	Oh wow.
YOU1000000040_S0000044	Wow that is good!
YOU1000000040_S0000045	wow the meat is so soft, it's not being charred right down so it doesn't have like the crunchy bits you often get with this type of meat, it's just really soft
YOU1000000040_S0000046	it's quite salty it's got a beautiful saltiness
YOU1000000040_S0000048	that butter it just sort of coats your mouth I was expecting maybe it to be a little bit buttery a little bit oily on the top of my mouth
YOU1000000040_S0000049	not at all it's super rich and juicy I'm gonna get some more but this time I just want a couple of bits of meat so I don't want the yogurt or the bread, the yogurt flavour was very strong so the sourness of the yogurt
YOU1000000040_S0000050	I think overtook from the meat flavour a bit
YOU1000000040_S0000052	Mmm. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's good.
YOU1000000040_S0000054	oh the butter flavour really really came home that time so it's got quite a sweetness which I guess is coming from that tomato sauce oh this is really good
YOU1000000040_S0000055	I'm gonna make up a mouthful here with the flatbread, the lamb and also some chilli pepper and the bread has gone quite soft because of that tomato sauce and the butter and then that yogurt in there
YOU1000000040_S0000057	mmmm, mmmm that's really good, it's very rich from that butter, creamy from that yogurt but then you can really taste the flavour of the meat, that's delicious and we're also washing it down with
YOU1000000040_S0000058	a drink called sharra and it's a slightly fermented grape juice, sweetened grape juice and this is sort of the traditional accompaniment
YOU1000000040_S0000060	mmm cold, sweet, refreshing, a tiny little bit bubbly, is the perfect thing to go with this
YOU1000000040_S0000062	look how all that butter is just sitting in the bottom of the plate now so I'm gonna grab some more meat and a really soggy bread get it right through that butter, super oily
YOU1000000040_S0000064	mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, now I can really taste the butter, in my first bites I could taste the butter but it wasn't a big flavour, that is a super bold flavour
YOU1000000040_S0000065	really rich, creamy and super oily so there's oils from the meat, the tomato sauce and from the butter so you're getting this combination of different oiliness down there
YOU1000000040_S0000066	and it works a treat just hoeing into this plate, really, really good
YOU1000000040_S0000068	no day in Istanbul is complete without a ferry ride or two so now we're catching the ferry from the Asian side back over to Europe where we're going to continue our food hunt
YOU1000000040_S0000070	we've made it back to the European side of Istanbul and next up we're gonna have an absolute classic snack here in Turkey and that is Turkish delight now you will see this stuff piled up all over the city in the windows of shops
YOU1000000040_S0000071	massive piles of colourful Turkish light but we're not going to one of those places we're gonna go to this really traditional place here that's been around since 1926 you won't see those vivid colours here from food colouring
YOU1000000040_S0000072	it's all natural and this stuff is really, really good let's go grab some
YOU1000000040_S0000074	we're loaded up with our bags of Turkish delight I wanted to just stay in that sweet shop forever it had such a beautiful old world feel about it and the staff was so friendly they had these gorgeous huge candy jars
YOU1000000040_S0000075	filled with sweets, tons of Turkish delight and they even had big pots of homemade jam so you can take your own jam jars from home
YOU1000000040_S0000077	fill it up oh it was a beautiful spot we're now going to head off and find ourselves a Turkish coffee to wash these babies down
YOU1000000040_S0000079	It's a holiday here in Istanbul today so the coffee place we wanted to go to is sadly shut. It's known as one of the best places to get a Turkish coffee here in Istanbul so that is why we wanted to go to that particular place.
YOU1000000040_S0000080	so we've scrapped the coffee idea we're gonna do the next best thing here in Turkey and that is tea they have these brilliant little street side cafes just little mini cafes right on the footpath we're gonna grab a tea there
YOU1000000040_S0000082	we've set ourselves down at a small table at this tea cafe, ordered up a couple of glasses of our Turkish tea and we are going to crack into this Turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000083	so Turkish delight in Turkish is lokum and if you've never had lokum before it's like a jelly like sweet almost like a gummy and it's made out of corn flour and water and sugar
YOU1000000040_S0000084	and then they dust it with icing sugar once it's cooled and we ordered rose, pistachio and mint flavour and we've had this before and we know that it is amazing so I've got the pistachio here
YOU1000000040_S0000086	mmmm, mmmm, it's beautiful, the flavour of the pistachios is really strong so a really earthy flavour and the pistachios still have a bit of crunch they're not
YOU1000000040_S0000088	soft, they're quite crunchy and then the texture of the Turkish delight or the lokum is really sort of a little bit sticky, tiny bit chewy but very soft and it's very sweet
YOU1000000040_S0000089	so this tea is gonna go perfectly with it so they like to serve their tea with sugar, the Turks so I'm gonna pop the two sugars in because I find that the tea can be quite strong
YOU1000000040_S0000090	and quite bitter so we'll just give that a bit of a stir
YOU1000000040_S0000092	all right let's have a sip of this chai or tea
YOU1000000040_S0000094	oh yeah that's really good so it's very strong, quite bitter and I don't know if Thomas mentioned but drinking tea is like a national pastime in Turkey people stop and have a cup of tea like all throughout the day right from the early morning right through to
YOU1000000040_S0000095	to the evening, late late at night and both of us have really gotten into this pastime it's really nice to just take a moment out of your day, sit, watch the world go by, sip your tea
YOU1000000040_S0000096	and this is a perfect combination so you've got the really sweet Turkish delight and then the bitter tea to wash it down
YOU1000000040_S0000098	I am gonna grab a piece of mint Turkish delight and this is my favourite flavour for Turkish delight by a long way I've got great memories of Turkish delight as a young boy eating it because it was a bit of a treat in my family both my parents
YOU1000000040_S0000099	my auntie and uncle came to Istanbul in the 70s they got a taste for Turkish delight back then so it was always the treat thing we had on our family dinner table for after a meal let's try this mint
YOU1000000040_S0000101	oh it's delicious oh the flavor just builds you know when it's natural mint flavor because it comes on slowly and like Sheena said we've had this Turkish delight before and I know that this mint flavor just
YOU1000000040_S0000102	evolves and evolves and even 10 minutes later it's still in your mouth incredibly strong that is a beautiful, beautiful flavor and I love that it's not bright green like I talked about before
YOU1000000040_S0000103	when you see Turkish light in the shops on the main roads for tourist trips bright greens, bright pinks for the rose one these are not like that at all they're just very subtly coloured little flecks of mint in the mint one
YOU1000000040_S0000104	and the taste is absolutely incredible so if you're here in Istanbul you've definitely got to have a taste of Turkish delight and make sure you get it from this place or one of the few places like this one but this place does an incredible version of Turkish delight
YOU1000000040_S0000105	They're really good
YOU1000000040_S0000107	another great day of eating here in Istanbul and we're finishing with one of the Turkish delight places behind us that I've talked about a couple of times so the colorful stuff piled up on
YOU1000000040_S0000108	touristy strips so don't go to one of those go to where we did this place is incredible for food though

YOU1000000044_S0000018	Bottle cast has told me that I should shave my beard and I would look 20 years younger so and I was telling him I have a wife who thoroughly enjoys this beard and
YOU1000000044_S0000019	I do, I do. See, you can see that.
YOU1000000044_S0000020	And has
YOU1000000044_S0000021	You are already starting getting crazy.
YOU1000000044_S0000022	The party's already started so
YOU1000000044_S0000024	So yeah, so I appreciated the the feedback I My sister actually would slide with you well, she's always wanted me to get rid of it
YOU1000000044_S0000025	I had it most of my life actually go tea. I recently just shaved I had a full winter beard He was a fellow Canadian understand not for the winter months
YOU1000000044_S0000026	But I always had some sort of facial hair except for two years two or three years. I guess when I worked in Saskatchewan hauling crude oil
YOU1000000044_S0000027	Because of the fire restrictions to be able to wear a mask in case of emergency You're not allowed to have any facial hair except for a mustache so
YOU1000000044_S0000028	Yes, I'm forgetting he's reminding me about the about the camera because I'm used to having it on my computer and now it's between the both of us
YOU1000000044_S0000029	So I always had a clean-shaven face during that time, and it was probably one of the more depressing parts of my life I liked my job, but it just never felt like me
YOU1000000044_S0000030	So it was one of the first things I did as soon as I stopped working at that we moved back to Montreal was to grow my facial hair again, and I don't think I've ever gone without it since
YOU1000000044_S0000031	Yeah, maybe once or twice I I think
YOU1000000044_S0000032	I would just shave and start over again, but it was very temporarily
YOU1000000044_S0000033	Yeah, it's a funny tidbit actually before we went to Saskatchewan you have long hair
YOU1000000044_S0000034	Very long hair.

YOU1000000044_S0000038	I don't know just something about it. I I just like it I mean, I like it when you shave it off too, but it's just some that forest caveman
YOU1000000044_S0000039	Yes, exactly does have a thing for the key that for strictly and
YOU1000000044_S0000040	Viking caveman mix I would say I guess
YOU1000000044_S0000041	Viking wedding, and I think that's one of the shortest my facial hair and beard and the hair actually ever was
YOU1000000044_S0000042	Yeah, well you have it's a little bit shaved on the side. Yeah, but I I wanted the way he is right now. That's my favorite
YOU1000000044_S0000043	Yeah.

YOU1000000044_S0000215	I have hangouts by the way. Sorry. Yes. Sorry. Yeah, go on.
YOU1000000044_S0000216	Anything about editing what we use what you guys use? What kind of cameras we use you'd like to know about?

YOU1000000044_S0000220	ASMR Ross is asking what do we use to stream?
YOU1000000044_S0000221	What do we use the stream well right now? It's hangouts, and we're just working with our webcam and
YOU1000000044_S0000222	I actually just bought the other day the Logitech c29 22 see I believe it's called
YOU1000000044_S0000223	Is there a messaging system in the Hangouts that we are using through the YouTube right now?
YOU1000000044_S0000224	No, not that I'm aware of. I shouldn't say that. This is something that's...
YOU1000000044_S0000225	I'm gonna go and sign up yeah, I'm gonna sign up so we can have our train manual
YOU1000000044_S0000227	Though we use that for the camera, and then I have my road mic my road Pro, and I use that through my computer
YOU1000000044_S0000228	We never live stream till a couple of nights ago, so it was never a necessity not something we ever looked into so we kind of just had to jump into this with both feet, but
YOU1000000044_S0000229	We're hoping to streamline it more. We definitely going to be doing more live streams. It's it's apparent that it is working well
YOU1000000044_S0000230	Especially like I say since we mostly do faceless video
YOU1000000044_S0000231	We don't get a chance to connect as much so this is really important
YOU1000000044_S0000233	I'm gonna go to that What is it OSB or OBS OBS? I'm definitely gonna probably play with that tomorrow if I have the time so
YOU1000000044_S0000235	Do you have any questions, bottle caps?
YOU1000000044_S0000237	Put them all in we're gonna try to answer the ones that we can of course and stay good

YOU1000000044_S0000274	Not just to talk about the platform, but to talk about what you're doing what your interests are Where you started any kind of stories you'd like to talk about?
YOU1000000044_S0000276	Man you are testing out my computer knowledge. How do you even do that? Well brother doing do you have Twitter?
YOU1000000044_S0000278	Yes, seventh blessings seven blessings. I agree with you too that the algorithm does suck on the weekends. That's for sure
YOU1000000044_S0000280	We checked our analytics and right now. We're doing best as Wednesday and Friday, right?
YOU1000000044_S0000281	Yeah, Wednesday Thursday Friday, so yeah, that's probably a be our target days
YOU1000000044_S0000282	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000284	for now
YOU1000000044_S0000285	Yeah, exactly.
YOU1000000044_S0000287	I actually like trying to do the live streams in between them as well, and that's a good day for uploading videos So we'll mix and match them up some
YOU1000000044_S0000288	No Twitter
YOU1000000044_S0000289	Um,
YOU1000000044_S0000291	Larry I'm a fisherman too. Oh, we got lots of fishermen in here I
YOU1000000044_S0000293	Brother doing do you have Facebook?
YOU1000000044_S0000295	anything that we can message you at.
YOU1000000044_S0000296	That then that's all you'll have to do is click on the link and you'll be hooked up which I've been on YouTube for four years and now going on five since January
YOU1000000044_S0000297	13th 2015 Wow so you definitely been around for a while relations
YOU1000000044_S0000299	Bottle caps if you watch my last video I made and there's no editing cuts in it
YOU1000000044_S0000300	Just better than to hold somebody's attention once a fast editing
YOU1000000044_S0000301	or something, cuts in which is better to hold somebody's attention.
YOU1000000044_S0000302	lots of fast or something just smooth
YOU1000000044_S0000303	Okay, I the question into it it really depends what the message is you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000304	I mean yeah, I do some very fast editing, but I also if you take my 16 again for a day videos are a lot of them where I grew up in the gas Bay
YOU1000000044_S0000305	Uh...
YOU1000000044_S0000307	And they shouldn't because it will absolutely destroy the mood you do a lot of outdoor scenery and you can't get a lot of outdoor scenery
YOU1000000044_S0000308	And it also depends on your music to what you want to do My last one I did with the European countries. I mean they're very slow panning
YOU1000000044_S0000309	It goes and turns the side well. That's a white flash. I put in and then I rotate I forget now maybe 25 degrees and then I turn it off
YOU1000000044_S0000310	But that's just for a transformation to follow with the beat Yeah, smooth is great lots of people that's it depends what you want. What kind of a story you want to tell
YOU1000000044_S0000311	It's amazing how you can take one piece of footage, grab 10 different tracks of different genres, different tempos.
YOU1000000044_S0000312	That would have made Would have you would have never even guessed of making just by following the beat
YOU1000000044_S0000313	And also to it depends on the editor what they're comfortable with I mean I some people it's like guitar players when I was in bands and
YOU1000000044_S0000314	There's some guys whether the song was 10 beats a minute. I know that's extreme. I'm just for the point of conversation
YOU1000000044_S0000315	200 beats a minute they play the same wiry fast screaming solo over to it
YOU1000000044_S0000316	And for me it just didn't make any sense, but to them that's just what they wanted to do so
YOU1000000044_S0000318	But I find for what you do your type of videos and the type of music you go with smoother is definitely speaks more of what you do and they look great
YOU1000000044_S0000320	Dune says that he has Facebook doing if you can just go over to our Facebook push the studios with that one or push the studios
YOU1000000044_S0000321	Yeah, yeah.

YOU1000000044_S0000377	I know Google does their little promotion things now and then but I hadn't heard anything about this

YOU1000000044_S0000385	And definitely it's great to see more train guys to get over there. It's not for us It's for everybody to grow in the community of YouTube
YOU1000000044_S0000386	And just search on YouTube for hashtag. I'm a creator and Go over and put one of your videos or two of them into the playlist and
YOU1000000044_S0000387	And start watching other people and they're gonna come and start watching you and you can really build up your numbers quickly And we do have some train fans that aren't don't even don't have train names in the title

YOU1000000044_S0000399	Okay, so hellos on heavens we feel weird about putting our own video on the I am creator playlist so
YOU1000000044_S0000400	You should
YOU1000000044_S0000401	Put your own and then put somebody else's
YOU1000000044_S0000402	The best practice I think was two videos now. Yeah. Yeah
YOU1000000044_S0000403	Two videos that you think are gonna be good for catching attention and letting people know what you're about
YOU1000000044_S0000404	Put it on it's like advertising. It's free advertising. You don't want to be shy advertising you want to be advertising
YOU1000000044_S0000405	We're a co-op and we got to each represent ourselves, but also we're helping each other at the same time So it's a win-win for everybody
YOU1000000044_S0000406	So yeah, that's what they were doing never putting up one or two of their own especially if you're just starting there
YOU1000000044_S0000407	And then watch a bunch of peoples and you see somebody that's not on there yet definitely I want a couple of theirs like one or two from as many people as possible
YOU1000000044_S0000408	Yes, definitely, and I'm gonna remember again. It's a co-op as Andrew said it's all it's for everybody so don't be shy just do it
YOU1000000044_S0000409	People more men 82 is from Prince Edward Island, Canada
YOU1000000044_S0000410	Welcome all we love your province

YOU1000000044_S0000470	Okay, and
YOU1000000044_S0000472	Okay now back to you guys The moment 82 push away are you based out of where from Montreal?
YOU1000000044_S0000473	Actually there are two parts of us we're based out of Montreal Canada in Quebec
YOU1000000044_S0000474	But I am originally from Latvia, which is the Baltic states in northern Eastern Europe.
YOU1000000044_S0000476	So a little bit of European and a little bit of Canadian based in Montreal.
YOU1000000044_S0000477	That's right. A good mix.
YOU1000000044_S0000478	Yeah, great mix.
YOU1000000044_S0000479	Yeah, exactly.
YOU1000000044_S0000480	They are three away from 550
YOU1000000044_S0000481	Alright
YOU1000000044_S0000482	If anybody haven't subscribed yet, please go over. That's how I roll.
YOU1000000044_S0000483	We showed this last night just to show you where Xenia is from originally
YOU1000000044_S0000484	Excuse me, so this is a map of Europe of course and there's Latvia, and that's the capital Riga where? She was raised
YOU1000000044_S0000485	And Pusha, the town that we named our business after,
YOU1000000044_S0000486	Now we laugh last night because I did get it. It's tricky to find it's a small little town. There's pusha
YOU1000000044_S0000487	And this is the town that we named our business after because that's where her mom grew up.
YOU1000000044_S0000488	It's roughly about 45 kilometers from the Russian border a beautiful place. I absolutely adore it there
YOU1000000044_S0000489	Let's see if I can find.
YOU1000000044_S0000491	It's kind of tricky to show pictures now. I got it last night for the road, but it's very white on my screen because of the lights, so I might not be able to see it.
YOU1000000044_S0000492	But we'll give it a try anyways Well here, we'll just do one on the road here
YOU1000000044_S0000494	Now I got Thud in my way, so I'm just going to have to bring this up a little bit. Bear with me.
YOU1000000044_S0000496	Close this and... Oh, all my YouTube advertisements are getting in the way, but that's okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000497	Just some.
YOU1000000044_S0000499	And it's gorgeous over there. We do still have some property over there.
YOU1000000044_S0000500	In just up this road we can go for a little walk drive for you to Google Drive if you want to call it that
YOU1000000044_S0000501	As you can see it reminds me a lot of some of the people here that are from Canada or maybe familiar It reminds me a bit of New Brunswick Except it's mostly pine trees instead of spruce
YOU1000000044_S0000503	But a lot of the same kind of rolling hills, not very un-mountainous.
YOU1000000044_S0000504	I thought well, there's only one mountain, and that's literally is 300 meters high
YOU1000000044_S0000506	But still an amazing amazingly beautiful place. Oh, I think I found it I
YOU1000000044_S0000508	Go in.
YOU1000000044_S0000510	Over here.
YOU1000000044_S0000512	This is the her mom's family home and Right over here. This is the new house. They're building in front actually, but it was right at this spot and
YOU1000000044_S0000514	Not a lot of travelers. I kind of stand out when I'm there I'm a little bit of a traveler, but I'm not a big fan of traveling
YOU1000000044_S0000515	Latvians in a very very hard language to speak there's only 1.7 million people around in the world I believe I heard 2 million let's speak it
YOU1000000044_S0000516	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000517	It is considered an endangered language. I was learning Russian because of course as a next Soviet country you can get by with Russian in most places.
YOU1000000044_S0000518	There's from the side and here is where the stork is that I always like to see when I go over there the storks nest
YOU1000000044_S0000519	So which is cool because almost every house does have a nest and the thing is like the size of a 45 gallon drum
YOU1000000044_S0000520	But we actually stay in the new house when we were visiting the last time and a Stork land on the roof And they were all excited and said that's a sign of good luck to us
YOU1000000044_S0000521	That the who's ever in the house was probably gonna have a child we already have three so I informed my wife There was no way I was staying in the house that night
YOU1000000044_S0000522	So
YOU1000000044_S0000523	I would honestly say it's enough.
YOU1000000044_S0000524	Yeah, yeah, we've done our part
YOU1000000044_S0000525	Jada Diva says that he uses Google Earth all the time. They love it.
YOU1000000044_S0000526	There's a game. I always play well I played for a week, and then I get too obsessed with it and have to back off for a bit and
YOU1000000044_S0000527	and it's called GeoGuessr.
YOU1000000044_S0000529	But you can pick like either the European Union or the United States Canada. There's tons of maps are already made and you can pick the maps that you want
YOU1000000044_S0000530	And it drops you off in the middle of nowhere, and you have to guess where you are
YOU1000000044_S0000531	But you cannot zoom out enough to see which country you're into you can only see where you're at
YOU1000000044_S0000532	I love doing the Europe one because you got a guest by the language on the signs trucks passing
YOU1000000044_S0000533	You you the points are determined you start off with 5,000 and then you go up to 10,000
YOU1000000044_S0000534	I believe works it to for every kilometer that you're away from the exact point
YOU1000000044_S0000535	And it's not like you just pick the country you got to pick the area where you're into But anybody who loves Google Maps it really makes it a lot funner
YOU1000000044_S0000536	Something to look into as well, and this is where I'm from well
YOU1000000044_S0000537	Here's Montreal here, and I'm from what they call the gas bay And this is like that thumb that sticks out from Quebec over top of New Brunswick and of course me in the lower side
YOU1000000044_S0000538	And then on above it is where the st.. Lawrence Seaway comes in into the Great Lakes
YOU1000000044_S0000540	I got it. I got it. Oh, and you went up to do the plus oh You okay, okay? I see what happened you went to add probably because the mic is right beside it
YOU1000000044_S0000541	Oh.
YOU1000000044_S0000542	Yeah, I never turn red.
YOU1000000044_S0000543	Yeah, did you guys hear us before that?

YOU1000000044_S0000551	Yeah, I was to Brunswick. Okay, then would be I what part of New Brunswick were you originally from?

YOU1000000044_S0000555	Nice to see you. Anybody want to go and listen to some great songs on Uber Drive?
YOU1000000044_S0000556	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000557	It's amazing you have never had a ride on a rumor like that before you gotta go check it out
YOU1000000044_S0000558	Very entertaining the people are great sports that she picks up. I think it's one of your favorite channels. I'd say
YOU1000000044_S0000559	Yes, my god. Yeah, I sing along. I literally sing along
YOU1000000044_S0000560	This is true. She is not making this up. I've heard her so I can vote for that.
YOU1000000044_S0000561	Yeah, that's true. Mauer man is for Edmunds.
YOU1000000044_S0000562	Edmundston all when we travel home we always go by New Brunswick. That's why I was curious and we always go by Edmundston
YOU1000000044_S0000563	Along the 185 and then into which is number two. I believe it is if I'm not mistaken It's so amazing to have you here That's great
YOU1000000044_S0000565	Uh
YOU1000000044_S0000567	One of the big land, one of the big attractions on the Gaspé, because it is a small town, it's all coastal fishing communities mostly.
YOU1000000044_S0000569	This is one of the most famous of the place and this usually represents the province of Quebec a lot of times.
YOU1000000044_S0000570	When they do the different visuals from all the provinces, and it's called Percy rock
YOU1000000044_S0000571	And it's this rock that literally was they figure moved about 80 kilometers during the Ice Age you can see in proportion to the buildings here
YOU1000000044_S0000573	And it's one of the most beautiful places, and it's heavily photographed.
YOU1000000044_S0000574	... ancient, you feel like you've just traveled back in time, every time you see it, it's incredible.
YOU1000000044_S0000575	Just looking to see if there's any other really great pictures of it. And there's a hole in the rock, of course.
YOU1000000044_S0000576	which there is a small ferry that does ferry tourist boats that drive right through the hole.
YOU1000000044_S0000577	And the piece that's beside it was once connected, but over time has fallen apart, and eventually that's what will happen, of course, to the other one as well.
YOU1000000044_S0000578	There's a huge bird sanctuary there. You can just see the corner of it right here called Bonaventure Island
YOU1000000044_S0000579	And it's monitored by I believe it's McGill University from Montreal
YOU1000000044_S0000580	Another perspective of it from the backside just to show you the size of it. It's colossal
YOU1000000044_S0000582	But it is definitely a place that if you're ever looking for somewhere off the beaten path,
YOU1000000044_S0000583	It's friendly. It's all that you can do the course of off. You can easily do it in a day, but you would drive yourself crazy
YOU1000000044_S0000584	You give yourself three, four days, and you'll see varied, varied, varied, varied, varied,
YOU1000000044_S0000586	It's almost like traveling through three different countries. I would say almost I would
YOU1000000044_S0000587	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000588	The north side has some of the oldest rocks in the world black worn down
YOU1000000044_S0000589	But an amazing feeling as the st.. Lawrence Seaway comes in on the lower side here is a lot more Closer to red rock that you would find for instance in Prince Edward Island, but it's a lot more
YOU1000000044_S0000590	but not as red as thirst, so it's not so oxidized.
YOU1000000044_S0000591	And then where I would live for instance where you come to the park following that river Which is nothing but trees and some of the highest mountains in Quebec
YOU1000000044_S0000592	which of course are all part of the Appalachians that run all the way down through the south of the United States.
YOU1000000044_S0000593	We're all connected yeah, so there's just some of the photos from it. There's some from the island the bird sanctuary
YOU1000000044_S0000595	Can you go check the microphone again, please?
YOU1000000044_S0000596	Again?
YOU1000000044_S0000597	You just go check.
YOU1000000044_S0000598	Yeah, well, it's good this time.
YOU1000000044_S0000599	Okay, uh just a second. Um, just hang on. Uh, the railroad man says he's on and let's try to connect him
YOU1000000044_S0000600	There is okay all righty
YOU1000000044_S0000602	Let's see here.

YOU1000000044_S0000618	Hey, I'm the same. I'm the same.
YOU1000000044_S0000620	I'm not that good with tech either.
YOU1000000044_S0000621	As my grandmother who has been to London once said, technology is great when it works, but it's a real pain in the neck when it doesn't.
YOU1000000044_S0000622	Oh, yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000623	Words to live by, words to live by.
YOU1000000044_S0000624	Yes, sir.
YOU1000000044_S0000625	So you were just on a vacation you were just on a trip, right?
YOU1000000044_S0000626	Yes, my most recent trip my first my most recent major one was to the Bahamas recently. Oh, oh
YOU1000000044_S0000627	Pardon me? Princess Kay and Nashaw, that's the two places we stopped at. Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000629	That's great. I know how long you're there for.
YOU1000000044_S0000630	I think we were there for I think a few days I can't remember most of the time was on the boat.
YOU1000000044_S0000631	Also, I am currently doing a live stream on my phone. I sent a video link to it and I have to look.
YOU1000000044_S0000632	Let me go to y'all's channel when in doubt just to go and uh look. Oh, that's cool. I'm seeing myself on your stream
YOU1000000044_S0000634	I like it. I like it.
YOU1000000044_S0000635	It's as if I was in control almost.
YOU1000000044_S0000637	How's things going with the channel your channel?
YOU1000000044_S0000638	Well, it literally hit 504 subscribers only a few minutes ago.

YOU1000000044_S0000640	Amazing.
YOU1000000044_S0000641	That's amazing. Great. Good for you.
YOU1000000044_S0000642	Yeah, yeah the video link that I sent is in your video back by popular demand
YOU1000000044_S0000643	Who's the studios last room sorry if I said the name wrong no the town is what I know you guys were talking about it, but um I
YOU1000000044_S0000644	Exactly what country is it in? I'm guessing it's in Europe, correct?
YOU1000000044_S0000645	Yes, that's correct. It's in Latvia.
YOU1000000044_S0000646	Mm.
YOU1000000044_S0000647	Yeah, and let Latvia's above it's a coastal country for both the Baltic Sea right across from Sweden
YOU1000000044_S0000648	Mmm.
YOU1000000044_S0000649	I guess you bit of an angle, but yeah, you go through Poland and then to Lithuania and then to Latvia, so yeah, I think that's a good point
YOU1000000044_S0000650	Lithuania Latvia and Estonia is referred to as the Baltic States
YOU1000000044_S0000651	I've heard of all that, yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000652	So, yep.
YOU1000000044_S0000653	I must say, for a person who's been through Europe, what did you say, was 12 countries in 15 days or was it 15 countries in 12 days?
YOU1000000044_S0000654	So 12 and 15, yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000655	That's amazing and I have keep in mind. I have never been to Europe
YOU1000000044_S0000656	But my grandmother, she's been to London, she's been to France, she's been to Italy, she went to Florence where the Renaissance began.
YOU1000000044_S0000657	Wow.
YOU1000000044_S0000658	Amazing.
YOU1000000044_S0000659	Yeah, my grandmother is a retired school teacher and she has been traveling for most of her life since retiring. I only started traveling with her in 2008.
YOU1000000044_S0000660	Okay, that's good. Though. I'm glad you're getting out and doing stuff like that. Maybe it's in time for a trip to Europe for you both
YOU1000000044_S0000661	Well, we're waiting for, no offense, the madness that was going on recently over there to calm down.
YOU1000000044_S0000662	Definitely no that makes sense we haven't been over in what's the two years almost three years?
YOU1000000044_S0000663	Yeah, the summer is gonna be three years. We haven't been there, but wow
YOU1000000044_S0000664	Yeah, it's a long time feels like because we were traveling there every year almost and and then it kind of paused for a bit but
YOU1000000044_S0000665	Which country would you like to visit there?
YOU1000000044_S0000666	Well, frankly, I'd love to visit either Italy,
YOU1000000044_S0000667	or Greece because both have a rich history.
YOU1000000044_S0000668	Yes
YOU1000000044_S0000669	I'd like to go to Florence because I mean in my history class that was of course where the Renaissance began
YOU1000000044_S0000670	Right.
YOU1000000044_S0000672	Also, I must say I love the photos you have behind you all from Europe. I like that. I'm into historic architecture. That's something I like.
YOU1000000044_S0000673	Oh!
YOU1000000044_S0000674	This is from my well people had seen it last night, but oh I gotta clean off her camera
YOU1000000044_S0000675	Y'all aren't the only ones who usually have to do that.
YOU1000000044_S0000676	Clean off the cameras
YOU1000000044_S0000677	I have a camcorder and I have to clean the dust off the lens like regularly.
YOU1000000044_S0000678	You deserve the clearest picture possible.
YOU1000000044_S0000679	Oh man, that's beautiful. I love that. It kind of reminds me of Venice almost.
YOU1000000044_S0000680	I know that's probably not actually Venice, but it looks similar when you think about it.
YOU1000000044_S0000682	there so other people can see too.
YOU1000000044_S0000683	Oh, okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000684	I can see it clearly.
YOU1000000044_S0000686	Um, actually let me go on y'all stream because I think what they may be seeing right now is I think uh, I think my the bedroom at my grandmother's house
YOU1000000044_S0000688	Oh, no, never mind. It's coming in clear. It's coming in clear. Oh, okay. Now it's showing my face. Okay. That's a bit of an issue when you think about it.
YOU1000000044_S0000690	The other year we were talking about last night though pictures behind me we have a picture from every country that I visited
YOU1000000044_S0000691	And I would some of us to get some together and some of my own
YOU1000000044_S0000692	But the ones behind me there's the 12 of them that was my first ever time I traveled for two weeks mostly by train across Europe
YOU1000000044_S0000693	Wow.
YOU1000000044_S0000695	Train what's up?
YOU1000000044_S0000696	I've never traveled the country by train. I've been on plenty of scenic railroads and whatnot, but I've never been on a legit cross-country passenger train run.
YOU1000000044_S0000697	always wanted to do that. I know Canada has some very beautiful scenery and they still use vintage passenger equipment, I think, from the 50s and 60s.
YOU1000000044_S0000698	Some of them yeah that they have been modern modern modern modernizing. Thank you
YOU1000000044_S0000699	But yeah, they do still have some of the engines still running in that and there's also the more expensive one Maybe bottle caps can help me with the name of it
YOU1000000044_S0000700	I think it's the Canadian. I know that's one of their trains that still uses the vintage passenger car fleet.
YOU1000000044_S0000701	Yeah, but that's still part of the via real one, but there's another privatized one and it runs from Calgary to Vancouver
YOU1000000044_S0000702	Oh wow.
YOU1000000044_S0000703	And it stops at all the Fairmont hotels like all they have the five-star hotels every night and you
YOU1000000044_S0000704	I know they're Canadian actually, um...
YOU1000000044_S0000705	I know they stopped I think at a few of the chateaus that were built by the Canadian Pacific. I could be wrong. I could be wrong.
YOU1000000044_S0000706	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0000708	But yeah, I did, like I said in the stream chat, I've been wanting to try and do an interview about my channel for a while now.
YOU1000000044_S0000709	I actually tried to do two self-interviews. I really don't think they were very good in my opinion.
YOU1000000044_S0000710	This is an honor for me, okay? Keep that in mind.
YOU1000000044_S0000711	Oh my God, well it's an honor for us to have you here.
YOU1000000044_S0000712	Thanks, y'all.
YOU1000000044_S0000713	We're still getting our sea legs if you will for this so it's a lot harder
YOU1000000044_S0000714	This is a good start.
YOU1000000044_S0000715	Well it is it is and there's lots of great people. I mean this community is very supportive, and that's what really means a lot Did you join the I'm a commuter? I am a creator community
YOU1000000044_S0000716	Uh, no, I don't think I did. Is there a possibility I could send the link to that in the Hangouts chat?
YOU1000000044_S0000717	Yeah after the stream I will set you up
YOU1000000044_S0000719	All right.
YOU1000000044_S0000720	This is a great place. That's where a lot of us that are here have met each other I'm looking through the list here, and that's a lot of them came from there And it's a great place to network with other people
YOU1000000044_S0000721	Also here, I'll uh, I'm gonna send you guys the link to my stream because I
YOU1000000044_S0000722	I included y'all's channel in the description for the stream right now. It's still live for me.
YOU1000000044_S0000723	Okay
YOU1000000044_S0000724	And it's at the very bottom of the list, my apologies. No problem. Sometimes I include a channel here or there that even though it's not in the stream, I figured it's too good not to include.
YOU1000000044_S0000725	Right
YOU1000000044_S0000726	When I saw y'all's video where y'all filmed the wind turbine train, which I still think is very well done,
YOU1000000044_S0000727	Thank you.
YOU1000000044_S0000728	That's what got me interested in y'all's channel, and I must say y'all's work is truly phenomenal. It's some of the most incredible video work I have seen.
YOU1000000044_S0000729	Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. You're too kind.
YOU1000000044_S0000730	Yeah, it's that's that train was filmed in the gas bay where I grew up where I showed in the map a while ago and
YOU1000000044_S0000731	And we were home on vacation and how the train thing started was I've always liked trains But I wanted something I could do with my my middle-aged dad
YOU1000000044_S0000732	We have three children excuse me and my middle one is now 11 He was 10 at the time, and I just wanted something I could do with him
YOU1000000044_S0000733	And I wanted to keep shooting stuff. It's hard with video because it's hard to find things that are interesting sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0000734	And that's when I finally decided to try the trains with him, so he come out with me all the time and
YOU1000000044_S0000735	He was a good supporter. We all get into it. He gets me. You know he gets to know it It's good time way to spend time together
YOU1000000044_S0000736	So long story short we were in the gas bay and the nice thing about that train is that Up until a couple years ago. It was an active railway via was going through there and
YOU1000000044_S0000737	Prior to that was the CN they had already privatized the freight But then there was a problem with one of the trestles and therefore they shut down all passenger
YOU1000000044_S0000738	So now you have to go to the town of New Brunswick, Camelton, up Camelton in the province of New Brunswick, just to be able to get a passenger train, which is an hour away from where I live.
YOU1000000044_S0000739	Ouch.
YOU1000000044_S0000740	But since they started building these windmills they actually have to truck them from the coast about 200 kilometers to that point then they load them on these train cars and
YOU1000000044_S0000741	Yep, so they're the maximum they're allowed is 72 cars because well for Canada you're allowed a maximum of two kilometer rail and
YOU1000000044_S0000742	Because that's the longest spur that they have Vanessa go off the tracks
YOU1000000044_S0000743	They stay publicize it you can go on their website, and they show you exactly when the train is leaving the full schedules
YOU1000000044_S0000744	I've never caught a turbine train before I've never caught one
YOU1000000044_S0000745	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000746	I didn't even see, the railroad line here in the US, Norfolk Southern, has a program
YOU1000000044_S0000747	where they paint some of their locomotives into the railroad paint schemes of railroads that they either merged or just simply no longer exist.
YOU1000000044_S0000748	Right.
YOU1000000044_S0000749	For one instance, when I was in Altoona, Pennsylvania, I actually caught the first, what we railfans here call, heritage unit.
YOU1000000044_S0000750	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000751	And it was the Pennsylvania Heritage Unit.
YOU1000000044_S0000752	And I kind of found that a perfect one to catch because the trackage going throughout Tuna formerly was owned and ran by the Pennsylvania Railroad.
YOU1000000044_S0000753	Wow, that's interesting
YOU1000000044_S0000755	Yeah, you do a lot into the digging behind the scenes. That's what I like about what you do actually
YOU1000000044_S0000756	Thank you. I'll tell you I'm into trains. I've been into them since I was two years old, but that's not the only thing that I do on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000757	I know this live streaming I've only gotten into recently. I actually was only started it on my birthday. That's really when I first got started with this.
YOU1000000044_S0000758	and it's sort of been getting more of the attention on my channel ever since.
YOU1000000044_S0000760	I really don't know.
YOU1000000044_S0000762	It's a great way of getting the view time.
YOU1000000044_S0000763	There's nothing wrong with that. I mean we're all here to grow and and it's nice to find new ways. It's like
YOU1000000044_S0000764	If a painter started painting and then only did the same type of style the rest of their life
YOU1000000044_S0000765	That is true.
YOU1000000044_S0000766	Everybody's like collaborated with another youtuber before recently his name is a Jesse Gillette
YOU1000000044_S0000767	He does he's a gaming youtuber he he does videos on a game called roblox
YOU1000000044_S0000768	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000769	I don't know if y'all heard of it, but he and I have done almost 34 videos together now.
YOU1000000044_S0000770	Wow.
YOU1000000044_S0000771	of them are what, you know, teenagers of my age call memes. I'll admit, they're hilarious. Some of them are related to me. I'm
YOU1000000044_S0000772	Some of them I asked him to make. Oh my God, I tell you, I find him funny. I don't know if anyone else would, but yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000773	I'll send you guys a link to his channel right quick. Let me see if I can pull it up here, okay? Represerve a mm
YOU1000000044_S0000774	See here.
YOU1000000044_S0000775	Our kids actually pray are playing Roblox
YOU1000000044_S0000777	Probably too much.
YOU1000000044_S0000779	That's the problem nowadays. People my age and younger are just getting more and more addicted to the games.
YOU1000000044_S0000780	Oh, it's okay as long as you have other hobbies like you have this and stuff so
YOU1000000044_S0000781	That's true.
YOU1000000044_S0000782	It's all about balance.
YOU1000000044_S0000784	Yes, that is true. And let me see here. I know I have his in a list of channels here. Let me see here.
YOU1000000044_S0000785	Also, I wanted to ask you, you did a trip to Alaska, didn't you?
YOU1000000044_S0000786	Yes, that was that trip had a lot of firsts if you will that was the first time I had been on a jet
YOU1000000044_S0000787	First time I've been to Seattle, Washington. First time I had been on a cruise ship. First time I've been to Alaska in general. First time I went to Canada.
YOU1000000044_S0000788	First time I've seen a glacier, yeah, there was a lot of firsts. And I had actually hoped, when I was there, I'd hoped to see orca whales.
YOU1000000044_S0000789	I'd made a sort of vow to only see whales in the wild and I had never got a chance to see them in Alaska, I never did.
YOU1000000044_S0000790	Well, that's great because it means you got another reason to go back
YOU1000000044_S0000791	True, but it was my grandmother who was able to make the trip possible and I had waited 13 years to go to Alaska 13 years.
YOU1000000044_S0000792	Wow. Wow. 2003 to 2016. And it was mainly due to a film my grandmother brought back on her trip to Alaska back in 2003.
YOU1000000044_S0000793	It was about a railroad that is in Skagway, Alaska. It's called the White Pass and Yukon Route.
YOU1000000044_S0000794	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000795	And it's been in use since 1898 and it didn't shut down normal revenue service until 1982.
YOU1000000044_S0000796	Okay, and it only stayed closed for five years and it reopened into the current operation it does now which is excursion trains in 1988.
YOU1000000044_S0000797	And after she brought the documentary back in 2003, I...
YOU1000000044_S0000798	Let's just say in her own words, once I sat down and watched it, I never moved. I was enthralled by it.
YOU1000000044_S0000799	And she told me the next time she went back she would take me with her and I waited of course like I said 13 years
YOU1000000044_S0000800	and I finally got to see the railroad for myself and ride it in 2016 and I have video footage of it now.
YOU1000000044_S0000802	A lot of my film I'm still trying to improve on none of the videos are currently edited. I'll admit that I'm there's there's a lot of stuff. I'm still trying to work on with my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000803	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0000805	But I mean I kind of like it that my videos are edited
YOU1000000044_S0000806	because a lot of the time, not many YouTubers really upload unedited footage anymore. And I like to show what normal YouTubers really just decide to leave out. That's what I like to do.
YOU1000000044_S0000807	Well everybody's got to find their own way to express themselves onto it I agree
YOU1000000044_S0000808	That's exactly what it is everybody's got to find their own way that they feel comfortable in spring sending their message
YOU1000000044_S0000809	That's true.
YOU1000000044_S0000810	Look at musicians. We can like take the same song the same lyrics and give it to 20 different musicians They're all gonna come up with a different way of expressing it
YOU1000000044_S0000812	Same with the music. I mean, I've always sometimes I've always said that I feel like I was just born in the wrong time because when you think about it,
YOU1000000044_S0000813	If you see my videos, I mean, especially when I did it Kettle Creek battlefield and here it near
YOU1000000044_S0000814	It's a Revolutionary War battlefield seven miles from Washington, Georgia, where I live. I live in Athens, but you know the battlefield is seven miles from Washington.
YOU1000000044_S0000815	In the video, I make a point to mention that I have a deep respect for war veterans, a very deep respect for them.
YOU1000000044_S0000816	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0000817	Because I mean just think about it just what they've gone through alone, you know, you know, they need they don't need I don't like it when they're forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0000818	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000819	And they deserve to be remembered, especially for what all they did.
YOU1000000044_S0000821	And I have a very deep respect for people who have come before my time.
YOU1000000044_S0000822	for a lot of the historical events that have happened before my time, all of that.
YOU1000000044_S0000823	But what interests me most is a lot of the things that were around before my time, a lot of the antiques and what not. I find that very interesting.
YOU1000000044_S0000824	Not many people in my generation really care about that stuff.
YOU1000000044_S0000825	How many your rate is very true.
YOU1000000044_S0000826	That is true, and it's a shame it is so it's great to have somebody like you that might inspire some of them to go and take a second look at it, so
YOU1000000044_S0000827	Trade man would like a shout-out of course trade man you can have a shout out you can join the panel if you like I'd always love to have you and if you don't feel like it tonight some other night

YOU1000000044_S0000848	Most people would be quite bitter at the situation and he can't wait to get back on the road again.

YOU1000000044_S0000862	It's when you have these things like brain farts and stuff like that because everybody's looking at you
YOU1000000044_S0000863	Hey, don't feel too bad, man. I'm the same way. I've had a few brain freezes in myself in my streams where I'm like, wait, what was I just saying?
YOU1000000044_S0000865	that happened to me on so many occasions, I swear.
YOU1000000044_S0000866	Well, that's part of the fun
YOU1000000044_S0000867	Imagine trying to stream for three hours straight and just
YOU1000000044_S0000868	You just talk about anything that comes to mind. That's what I've done, okay? I've streamed for three hours nonstop and I just talked about whatever came to mind.
YOU1000000044_S0000870	Whenever I do these streams, I can never stay and talk about one specific topic.
YOU1000000044_S0000871	I mean, it just, it sort of is random when you think about it, really.
YOU1000000044_S0000872	Mm-hmm that's what that's what keeps the world turning
YOU1000000044_S0000873	We are on a double we are on our stream, and we're really Roger stream as well
YOU1000000044_S0000874	Nice.
YOU1000000044_S0000876	Extremeception, that's what I call that.
YOU1000000044_S0000877	That's a good term.
YOU1000000044_S0000878	Contagious in a good way. We're growing.
YOU1000000044_S0000879	I tell you, my parents have actually told me I'm pretty much one who's unforgettable and I think they're right.
YOU1000000044_S0000880	I recently went to a rail line in West Virginia. It's called the Cass Scenic Railroad, which is really worth checking out by the way.
YOU1000000044_S0000881	And I actually befriended one of the guys who works on the train. His name is Josh And when I met him for the first time he was actually a commentator slash a brakeman and
YOU1000000044_S0000882	And I didn't... afterwards I ended up leaving Cass to go back to Georgia once our trip there ended and um...
YOU1000000044_S0000883	I didn't go back for two years and when I recently made a return trip, which is heavily documented on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000884	I am now it was also on the same trip where I went to Niagara Falls okay in Ontario Canada.
YOU1000000044_S0000886	And I saw him and I said, hey man, you remember me? And he was like.
YOU1000000044_S0000887	He remembered me after two years of not seeing me. He remembered who I was.
YOU1000000044_S0000888	That's amazing!
YOU1000000044_S0000889	That's really cool. And it's the same with my mom, my dad's mother too. When she went to, I think it was either Hong Kong or Beijing, she went there like three times.
YOU1000000044_S0000890	There was a street vendor who remembered her and he she hadn't even been back then back and I think three years at one point.
YOU1000000044_S0000892	Wow. Yeah, well, some people are just more memorable. Sounds like you.
YOU1000000044_S0000893	I think it depends on their character.
YOU1000000044_S0000894	That's what you need for YouTube, so that's all good traits, so
YOU1000000044_S0000895	I mean there's a few reasons I made the channel one the first reason originally was I want I made it.
YOU1000000044_S0000897	you know, in 2015, but this was when I had just started getting into filming and I, at this point, I had a computer.
YOU1000000044_S0000898	that really didn't work too well. It always had a hard drive for five or ten minutes in a sense.
YOU1000000044_S0000899	And I lost everything on a really sporadic basis and it was annoying, okay? It was very annoying.
YOU1000000044_S0000900	And the computer I have now which is a Toshiba laptop. I've had it for almost I think two or three years now.
YOU1000000044_S0000901	It's proven itself to be a very good computer. It's only had one hard drive crash, and it's not had a crash since, knock on wood.
YOU1000000044_S0000902	Good. Knock on wood for sure.
YOU1000000044_S0000903	But yeah, when I was uploading my videos, or at least trying to save them on my computer, I was... I mean, I had already been into YouTube. I'd been into YouTube for a while now.
YOU1000000044_S0000904	But yeah, hold on a second try man. I included your channel in the description by the way
YOU1000000044_S0000905	Yeah, I am made the channel so I would have a place to put my videos in case my computer crashed again I wouldn't lose them
YOU1000000044_S0000906	I never really thought anybody would view them or watch them. I didn't even know if I'd get any subscribers.
YOU1000000044_S0000907	And keep in mind, the footage is still there, but it's nearly four years old. And in my opinion now, it's like really bad, okay?
YOU1000000044_S0000908	I've even labeled one of my playlists, which is when I filmed in Folkston, it's in parentheses
YOU1000000044_S0000909	Well bad film if you will because it can't be watched. Okay. I was really inexperienced when I filmed that let me tell you
YOU1000000044_S0000910	Well, that's we all learned that we all start somewhere, and we look back at our own work But I mean that's all part of the process
YOU1000000044_S0000911	And a lot of times is making a good thing out of something that didn't quite work out the way. We were hoping
YOU1000000044_S0000912	Drew?
YOU1000000044_S0000913	Montreal slow-mo and the reason why is I recorded it by accident out of my car and I was driving and I
YOU1000000044_S0000914	I'd switched it to 120 frames a second
YOU1000000044_S0000915	Oh man!
YOU1000000044_S0000916	So I recorded literally two hours of slow-mo. What do I do?
YOU1000000044_S0000917	Oh no!
YOU1000000044_S0000918	I'm looking at all this stuff, and I'm like well. It's ruined
YOU1000000044_S0000919	Imagine if it was like at a traffic jam.
YOU1000000044_S0000920	And I covered a good 20 kilometers like what nine mile at 10 miles or something like that
YOU1000000044_S0000921	Wow
YOU1000000044_S0000922	So I decided to kind of pick it up, and I took it and turn it into a 1970s cop show went intro which I always was the love of old shows so
YOU1000000044_S0000923	Bye
YOU1000000044_S0000924	Might as well do something with it, so
YOU1000000044_S0000925	Hang on train man is asking me something in my stream train man. I'm in currently in Athens, Georgia, USA
YOU1000000044_S0000926	I've been in Georgia since my birth.
YOU1000000044_S0000927	Actually if you guys I mean, I'm just curious if y'all wanted to know you know why I named my channel railroad preserver mm
YOU1000000044_S0000928	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000929	Well, the railroad part refers to my interest.
YOU1000000044_S0000930	Not just in trains, but also in travel and vintage vehicles like planes and cars. I have an interest in that.
YOU1000000044_S0000931	Excellent.
YOU1000000044_S0000932	Reserva refers to my interest in antiques and
YOU1000000044_S0000934	history.
YOU1000000044_S0000935	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000936	of all areas, all spectrums. And 2000 is really, really refers to the year I was born. I was born in 2000. So I was born at the start.
YOU1000000044_S0000937	Kind of figured that when I wasn't a hundred percent, but I was putting my money on that one
YOU1000000044_S0000938	I mean, the last is like, oh, you have to be asked to, you know, everyone asks me about the first two parts of the name, but the last part is sort of self-explanatory. We need to think about it.
YOU1000000044_S0000939	I think bottle caps was born in 2000 as well. You guys got that in common, so
YOU1000000044_S0000940	While I was saying it's too old to chase girls now.
YOU1000000044_S0000941	Yeah, I don't believe it first
YOU1000000044_S0000942	I don't have a girlfriend to be honest with you. As crazy as it sounds, I'm 17 and I don't have a girlfriend.
YOU1000000044_S0000943	Well
YOU1000000044_S0000944	Bye.
YOU1000000044_S0000945	Rush.
YOU1000000044_S0000946	What girl would be into trains, you know it?
YOU1000000044_S0000947	There's one coming along Xenia's been oh with me on some of the train. She's taking some photos and stuff like that
YOU1000000044_S0000948	I wouldn't say her life revolves around it, but she has come out with me sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0000950	Won't break that one up more than I
YOU1000000044_S0000951	Oh, by the way, I sent my friend Jesse Gillette's channel in the Hangouts chat, by the way. I meant to tell you that earlier.
YOU1000000044_S0000952	Thank you. Thank you very much
YOU1000000044_S0000953	Yeah. I let me go to my playlist here.
YOU1000000044_S0000955	I recently did a stream where it showed me organizing my channel's playlist.
YOU1000000044_S0000956	because I had a lot of saved playlists which referred to either music or video playlists to my interest.
YOU1000000044_S0000957	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000958	And I sort of organized them. There's music from films I remember watching when I was younger up to the present.
YOU1000000044_S0000959	There's a documentaries I found on YouTube and sort of in a sense of sort of archived here on my channel
YOU1000000044_S0000961	Gaming videos and comedy I guess you could say from other youtubers some of which are my favorites
YOU1000000044_S0000962	Okay
YOU1000000044_S0000963	And
YOU1000000044_S0000964	Videos are in the playlist yes, it's a great way of showing people what is about and and you know let them watch it as well
YOU1000000044_S0000965	You can never be in enough bliss, even including your own.
YOU1000000044_S0000966	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0000967	True.
YOU1000000044_S0000968	Good for the algorithm as well, so
YOU1000000044_S0000969	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000971	Mean that also going back to the reason I made my channel you
YOU1000000044_S0000972	Aside from the uh, me making the channel as a um, a web place to show my videos
YOU1000000044_S0000973	You know, I didn't, as I said, you know, I didn't think anyone would even watch my video.
YOU1000000044_S0000974	I didn't even, you know, I had just already, you know, sort of made the assumption, you know, oh, no one would probably like him anyway, but...
YOU1000000044_S0000975	Eventually, you know people started to take notice it was slow at first Yeah, perfume wanted my channel had gotten to like I think 22 subscribers within
YOU1000000044_S0000976	then it started to drop and I was wondering, okay, you know, what was I doing wrong? Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000977	If you look at my playlist that I filmed in folks to take note none of the videos are named
YOU1000000044_S0000978	I didn't name it. I don't think I even named one until like a few weeks back.
YOU1000000044_S0000979	And I mean, I had footage from Cass, our drive from Charlotte, North Carolina to Cass, West Virginia.
YOU1000000044_S0000980	And keep in mind when I was filming these videos I had an earlier camera. It was a, I think it was a Sony camera.
YOU1000000044_S0000981	It wasn't a camcorder. In fact, hang on a minute. I have the newest camera I used for my trip to Alaska right here.
YOU1000000044_S0000983	Let me see here, let me get it out. Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0000985	This is uh, this is it. This is what I've been using since 2016 and it's proven to be a very good camera.
YOU1000000044_S0000986	I got it specifically for the trip to Alaska.
YOU1000000044_S0000987	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0000989	cool. That's one of the best cameras I've used.
YOU1000000044_S0000990	Well, that's the biggest thing is if you're comfortable with it. That's that's what makes everything
YOU1000000044_S0000991	I am comfortable with it, I can tell you that. But the phone I'm using to live stream is actually one of the newer electronics I've gotten in a while.
YOU1000000044_S0000992	I used to have was one my dad had and it didn't live stream
YOU1000000044_S0000993	Even when I recorded with a normal camera when you zoomed in on the camera it made everything Pixelated oh my god. I hated it. I was annoyed by that
YOU1000000044_S0000994	Couldn't zoom in on any little details. I wanted to get
YOU1000000044_S0000996	So I've been with that phone where the camera zoomed out most of the time or just barely zoomed in, but this one.
YOU1000000044_S0000997	Like for instance if I do this, here, let me, if you're watching this, Trent, careful for shaky camera footage. Let me just do this as an example here, okay?
YOU1000000044_S0000998	So you see my phone here right? You see it's aiming towards the computer? Yeah, watch.
YOU1000000044_S0001000	Please zoom in here. Look at that. It picks up even the computer screens pixels and then I can see the little details in the buildings in the photo behind y'all.
YOU1000000044_S0001001	That's amazing. What kind of fun is that?
YOU1000000044_S0001002	Yeah, it's a Verizon LG G5. I think is what it's called. Oh
YOU1000000044_S0001003	No!
YOU1000000044_S0001005	Very good phone. It's one of the newest phones I've gotten and by God it's worked well. Only problem, with my old phone I could record in sort of that first person camera view there.
YOU1000000044_S0001006	for almost an hour, a few minutes.
YOU1000000044_S0001007	Now with this one, I'm only, I'm limited to only five minutes, so I usually film in multi-view.
YOU1000000044_S0001008	That's how I got a lot of the video in my Bahamas trip filmed. It was in a multi-view function where you saw my face on one side and then you saw what I wanted the viewers to see on the other.
YOU1000000044_S0001009	A lot of the video I filmed in the Bahamas was of a steel drummer artist named Cordill. He was good with playing music on the steel drums.
YOU1000000044_S0001010	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001011	And I hit him. Oh, hello.
YOU1000000044_S0001013	You inspired me. I never thought to take a picture of what we're doing here.
YOU1000000044_S0001015	First for everything!
YOU1000000044_S0001017	You two are good to talk to, you know that? You really are.
YOU1000000044_S0001019	We're pretty easy going I'm doing this
YOU1000000044_S0001020	Hey, I'm having a good time too, man.
YOU1000000044_S0001021	That's great
YOU1000000044_S0001022	That's the beauty of YouTube. Everyone can come together and just have a good time. That's the beauty of it.
YOU1000000044_S0001023	That's what it looks like from our side.
YOU1000000044_S0001024	Okay, wow now that is truly professional. I like that. Oh my god. This is a
YOU1000000044_S0001025	thrown together as it can be.
YOU1000000044_S0001026	Hey, I think hey, it's better than the setup I have I have just this one laptop and which this laptop is the only one I have
YOU1000000044_S0001027	I don't even have an editing software on it, okay?
YOU1000000044_S0001028	Okay, keep that in mind
YOU1000000044_S0001030	It's all
YOU1000000044_S0001031	But you know going back to the channel again. I mean, I'm sorry. I don't know
YOU1000000044_S0001032	Yeah, the other reason has become more recent to me.
YOU1000000044_S0001033	and that is I have two younger sisters, one's named Peyton, the other's named Aubrey. Aubrey is the more recent of the two.
YOU1000000044_S0001034	They came well after me by quite a few years and
YOU1000000044_S0001035	Then I realized, you know, I don't know if my grandmother would still be able to travel by the time my sister, those two reached my age.
YOU1000000044_S0001036	I don't even know and I don't mean any offense to her.
YOU1000000044_S0001037	No, no.
YOU1000000044_S0001038	She's in her late 60s and I don't know if she would meet, you know, still
YOU1000000044_S0001039	You never know
YOU1000000044_S0001040	I don't know if she would still be alive when Aubrey's my age.
YOU1000000044_S0001041	Yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001042	So the reason I wanted to make my channel now is so those two can see my videos and see the trips that she and I went on together
YOU1000000044_S0001043	Yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001044	Keep in mind, I've been traveling with her, like I said, when I first came on here since 2008.
YOU1000000044_S0001045	A lot of those early trips have never been filmed.
YOU1000000044_S0001046	In fact, I asked her recently, you know, if we had time or when we had time available, if we could try and revisit some of the places we first traveled to.
YOU1000000044_S0001047	The first place I ever went to with her was to Kennesaw, Georgia. Now that's near Atlanta.
YOU1000000044_S0001048	And it's where two Civil War steam locomotives are housed. One's named the General, the other's named the Texas.
YOU1000000044_S0001049	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001050	And if you don't know what the Andrews rate is, I recommend looking it up. It's quite unique and it's quite interesting as to how it all played out.
YOU1000000044_S0001051	But both locomotives are preserved and I was amazed by the story about it.
YOU1000000044_S0001052	Mmm.
YOU1000000044_S0001053	and it took place during the American Civil War.
YOU1000000044_S0001054	where some Union spies tried to take a Confederate locomotive to burn railroad bridges along Confederate rail lines.
YOU1000000044_S0001055	to try and stop Confederate supply movements. But unfortunately their plans failed and they were eventually captured by the Confederates.
YOU1000000044_S0001056	I think all of them received the Medal of Honor, the ones who survived the POW camp.
YOU1000000044_S0001058	I think all of them got the Medal of Honor and I think they were the first to receive it except Andrews. He was excluded as a civilian, unfortunately.
YOU1000000044_S0001059	But the film has been, or the event has been, you know, sort of, I guess you could say, immortalized thanks to both locomotives being preserved.
YOU1000000044_S0001060	In fact, the general was restored to operating condition in the 1960s during the Civil War since Centennial.
YOU1000000044_S0001061	Right.
YOU1000000044_S0001062	And eventually it found its way into Georgia and it's been on display in Kennesaw ever since.
YOU1000000044_S0001063	Texas was on display at the Atlanta Cyclorama until recently when it went to Spanish North Carolina for cosmetic restoration from what I heard.
YOU1000000044_S0001064	You have amazing retention. It's unbelievable. You have memory. And the way you present yourself, it's quite amazing.
YOU1000000044_S0001065	I try.
YOU1000000044_S0001066	Well, you're definitely doing something right.
YOU1000000044_S0001067	You're a quick smart young man.
YOU1000000044_S0001068	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0001069	Thank you. It's nice to see you. Thank you very much.
YOU1000000044_S0001070	And I really like what you said about saving it for your sisters that Really struck a chord. I think that's amazing your intentions for doing all of this
YOU1000000044_S0001071	And it can happen in a moment's notice.
YOU1000000044_S0001072	I've had to go through two deaths in my family.
YOU1000000044_S0001073	Bye-bye.
YOU1000000044_S0001074	Oh.
YOU1000000044_S0001075	First was my grandmother's mom whom we called Donna. She, from what I heard at first,
YOU1000000044_S0001076	She had passed away in like a hospital, but I found out later her house had caught on fire due to an electrical fault.
YOU1000000044_S0001077	But oh no.
YOU1000000044_S0001078	I mean, I think she was asleep, but from what I was told, I think she died from smoking
YOU1000000044_S0001079	And so the fire didn't get her, heck, her bedroom was untouched. And from what I was told, she didn't even know anything had happened. She had passed in her sleep.
YOU1000000044_S0001080	Which is good. She didn't suffer which is good, but I mean it it hit me hard to
YOU1000000044_S0001081	because I had never, not even once, now keep in mind I was only 11 years old when this happened. I had never experienced a death in my family before.
YOU1000000044_S0001082	And let me tell you, it was unexpected. I did not even know until...
YOU1000000044_S0001084	my mom's dad, my mom's mother, not my mom's mother, black,
YOU1000000044_S0001086	My dad's mother, who is the one who I was, I've been telling you all about, she's the one who's been taking me on all these trips until he called my mom and told her.
YOU1000000044_S0001087	And I mean, it still hurts just for me to think about it.
YOU1000000044_S0001088	and unfortunately it, I mean, that wasn't going to be the last time I sort of had a visit from, I guess you could say, deaf, so to speak.
YOU1000000044_S0001089	I mean, a few years later, recently, we lost my stepfather's grandmother, who we called Grandma Sandy.
YOU1000000044_S0001090	And from what I remember, she suffered a heart attack. Now keep in mind, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to her.
YOU1000000044_S0001091	but not but Sandy. Oh gosh. That was the first funeral I ever attended
YOU1000000044_S0001092	And that was the first time I had ever seen a person I once saw alive when they were deceased. That has never left me.
YOU1000000044_S0001093	Definitely quite something to go through especially when you're a child is it's definitely a leave some art for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001094	I can relate so I understand what you're talking about for sure.
YOU1000000044_S0001095	But I'm great grateful for the memories that we have from the people that have passed
YOU1000000044_S0001096	That's very nice. Thank you so much for sharing that with us.
YOU1000000044_S0001097	Absolutely, I'm really glad and I mean, I'd like to spend as much time with her as I can and believe me.
YOU1000000044_S0001098	I mean, I have a deep respect for, like I said, people who've come before my time. She's one of them and she's a very kind lady.
YOU1000000044_S0001099	She's very wise. She's actually hosting a party for some friends right now as I'm speaking.
YOU1000000044_S0001101	He's the hostess of Stratford, if you will.
YOU1000000044_S0001102	Oh, hey!
YOU1000000044_S0001103	We're going to, we're actually going to be going on another trip in a few days. We're going to be revisiting a few towns in Georgia, down in southwest Georgia.
YOU1000000044_S0001104	One of them is named Cordial, Georgia. I have footage of my first trip there on my channel.
YOU1000000044_S0001105	The reason we were going back is because of a few things we weren't able to do there on my first trip.
YOU1000000044_S0001106	We were going to ride an excursion train that's down there called the Sam's Short Line. They have a website. You can probably look it up, I think.
YOU1000000044_S0001107	Okay, and they weren't running when we were down there before so we're gonna try and go down there So I can film that when the trains running
YOU1000000044_S0001108	And we're gonna go to a museum in Tifton, Georgia, which is a replica of a historic village.
YOU1000000044_S0001109	And they have a lot of equipment there that's from like I think the 1890s, early 20th century.
YOU1000000044_S0001110	And it sort of depicts early life in Georgia, I think from the 1830s to the 1890s and into like I think the early 1900s, 1920s I think.
YOU1000000044_S0001111	I can't remember exactly how far in time it goes, but it's really well done. The historians there are really good at telling the story.
YOU1000000044_S0001112	And all the buildings I think are original, and I think there's only a few that have had to be rebuilt.
YOU1000000044_S0001113	But they're rebuilt in such a way to where they don't look like they're modern. They're built to where they're original.
YOU1000000044_S0001114	Which is amazing to me. I was impressed at how well they kept all the buildings up and a lot of them actually had steam-powered equipment
YOU1000000044_S0001115	Now keep in mind my first trip there none of it was running.
YOU1000000044_S0001116	This time we had, my grandmother has a lot of friends.
YOU1000000044_S0001117	And I think a friend of hers daughter, who is like, I think the curator or something is going to be there.
YOU1000000044_S0001118	And they're hosting a festival there, so a lot of their equipment is going to be running. So that's going to be neat for me to check out, and I am going to film it.
YOU1000000044_S0001119	And I'm hoping this will sort of play out like my return trip to Cass where although I didn't get a lot filmed on the first time I'm hoping to get more done on the second time
YOU1000000044_S0001120	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001121	That's amazing and so you're traveling all the time
YOU1000000044_S0001122	Well, not exactly all the time. I do have school in the way, though. Unfortunately.
YOU1000000044_S0001123	Never was that, but still.
YOU1000000044_S0001124	That's the grade level I'm in in high school right now.
YOU1000000044_S0001125	Now don't mind me for just a minute because we are still new to this I just want to try the controls here for a minute, okay?
YOU1000000044_S0001126	All right.
YOU1000000044_S0001127	So I'm just gonna try this for a second. I want to first hide broadcast from broadcast and bring you back
YOU1000000044_S0001129	Okay, so we're good. Sorry guys. We got to do this when you're alive. It's the only way to try it
YOU1000000044_S0001130	Show and broadcast okay, you're back
YOU1000000044_S0001132	All right.
YOU1000000044_S0001133	Okay perfect present to everyone this seems to be quite low oh
YOU1000000044_S0001134	Whoa, okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001136	Well, this is interesting.
YOU1000000044_S0001138	I may have accidentally muted the stream for a bit. That was...
YOU1000000044_S0001139	Not my intention, okay? Keep that in mind. I didn't want me to do that. That was a major fail on my part.
YOU1000000044_S0001140	We all been there like I say look at us right now. We're just playing
YOU1000000044_S0001141	I mean, if you watch, you can actually see my reaction and what I was talking to myself about in my stream when I accidentally did it, okay?
YOU1000000044_S0001142	It was on my face cam though, so yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0001143	Biker Bushcraft is saying that he's enjoying your historical perspectives.
YOU1000000044_S0001144	Well.
YOU1000000044_S0001145	He understands your connection to your grandmother and his was born in 1800s and had great story Wow Thank you
YOU1000000044_S0001146	I honestly, one of the reasons I have a major respect for the people who came before me is because
YOU1000000044_S0001147	I really wish someone could go and interview all these people who were around and who are still living in the 1800s.
YOU1000000044_S0001148	in the 1900s.
YOU1000000044_S0001149	And you know write their stories down because once that person dies their stories are lost for good and
YOU1000000044_S0001151	My stepfather's grandfather, his name was Tom Butler, he was a World War II veteran.
YOU1000000044_S0001152	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0001153	And unfortunately, I don't think he was ever interviewed. So a lot of his stories are only able to be retold through my stepfather's mouth.
YOU1000000044_S0001154	My stepfather actually has two Japanese rifles that Tom Butler brought back.
YOU1000000044_S0001155	Yeah, try doing that nowadays if you're in their service no offense any war veterans out there no offense
YOU1000000044_S0001156	No, I know what you're saying though, I know. And they understand this as well, I'm sure.
YOU1000000044_S0001157	But I mean they also put in the amazing service, and we do thank them very much for their service and anybody who puts their life in the line
YOU1000000044_S0001158	But yeah some of these guys seen some very hard conditions And not much to work with you know it was very primitive
YOU1000000044_S0001159	I just wanted to show you if you have a second if you'd like to see it. This is Xenia's grandfather He was a general in the Russian Air Force
YOU1000000044_S0001161	Oh, wow.
YOU1000000044_S0001163	Talk about Russian style.
YOU1000000044_S0001165	Sorry, that was like a failed Russian impression. Just, my bad.
YOU1000000044_S0001166	That's all good that was here, and there as well there
YOU1000000044_S0001167	And a very... Can I show this on my stream?
YOU1000000044_S0001168	Yeah, go ahead.
YOU1000000044_S0001169	Sure.
YOU1000000044_S0001170	Oh wow, and that's a World War I era bioplane, correct me, is that World War I?
YOU1000000044_S0001171	World War two world war one you have for that one yes, that's her great-grandfather here on the left
YOU1000000044_S0001172	Yep.
YOU1000000044_S0001173	Wow, yeah, did he ever tell you all any stories? We all his parents any stories about him?
YOU1000000044_S0001174	Yeah, my grandfather, he was a scientist and inventor.
YOU1000000044_S0001175	He mostly likes to talk about his innovations and things like that.
YOU1000000044_S0001176	I think he's seen a lot in World War two that he didn't want to talk about because probably it was too traumatic and
YOU1000000044_S0001177	He was. It's like some of those guys in Vietnam. I mean, you know, that's like that with every soldier. I mean, you know, just what those guys went through alone is enough.
YOU1000000044_S0001178	Yes, definitely.
YOU1000000044_S0001179	Exactly and my grandmother who also lived through the war and actually in the wartime she
YOU1000000044_S0001180	Working in one of the factories putting together guns They were made to do
YOU1000000044_S0001181	She was telling me more stories about it, but you know
YOU1000000044_S0001182	Like when she when she immigrated so to say or was sent to Latvia where I'm from originally and
YOU1000000044_S0001183	The city was still bombed through and she had to every morning go through the ruins of bomb through Oh City to get to work
YOU1000000044_S0001184	So she was telling me more about how it was during and even after the war and both Russians and not having food and living on potatoes and all that
YOU1000000044_S0001185	My grandfather, I think he got, he's seen the blood of it, so to say.
YOU1000000044_S0001186	So he was less talkative about the actual war things and more about his inventions
YOU1000000044_S0001187	The picture you see up now, this is exactly
YOU1000000044_S0001188	Yep ouch
YOU1000000044_S0001189	Yeah, he is a quite a man. I never got to meet him unfortunately was taken early in life, but I
YOU1000000044_S0001190	Ouch. That's the same with my stepfather's grandfather, Tom. He died in 2004, so I really never got to meet him.
YOU1000000044_S0001191	I mean there's one story now that he told my stepfather that my stepfather's told me so he's passed it down Which is I'm really glad for
YOU1000000044_S0001192	Now, I don't remember exactly if this, I can't, now it may not be accurate with me, but I think what, how it went was, you know, I,
YOU1000000044_S0001193	Tom was assigned to some of the land clearing teams which cleared out airstrips so our
YOU1000000044_S0001194	Plans could look planes could not plans blah. There's one of those brain farts y'all are talking about. I said plans and I meant to say planes.
YOU1000000044_S0001196	He was clearing out airstrips on one of the occupied islands so that our planes could land in.
YOU1000000044_S0001197	Out of nowhere, a Japanese sniper started shooting at him. He was using a bulldozer at the time, from what I was told.
YOU1000000044_S0001198	So what he did was to protect himself and shield himself was he raised the bucket of the bulldozer up so that the bullets would hit the bucket.
YOU1000000044_S0001199	And I guess when he found the tree the sniper was in he used the bulldozer and rammed the tree the sniper was in and knocked the tree down
YOU1000000044_S0001200	Wow.
YOU1000000044_S0001201	And I think what he did then was he tied the sniper up and I think that was how he got the rifle that he, my stepfather now has.
YOU1000000044_S0001202	I could be wrong on that, okay? I'd have to ask my stepfather for more confirmation in terms of accuracy, but...
YOU1000000044_S0001203	See that's the thing, it's kind of like with Civil War veterans, you know, that's what's happening now to a lot of these World War II guys.
YOU1000000044_S0001204	You know, I mean, once, you know, you know, because the Civil War, once the last veteran died in 1959, you know, that story has pretty much been forgotten, heck.
YOU1000000044_S0001205	They hardly even teach me about it in my school. Can you believe it?
YOU1000000044_S0001206	I learned more about it thanks to a documentary that Ken Burns made about it than what they're teaching me about it in school.
YOU1000000044_S0001207	Yeah, that's an unfortunate side of her, but I believe you on that
YOU1000000044_S0001208	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0001209	By the way, getting back to the recording memory, so to say, or interviews with people that are older,
YOU1000000044_S0001210	I have recently got into a thing called story corpse. I don't know if you have that
YOU1000000044_S0001211	It's basically it's a website mostly an app where it has either already pre-prepared questions or
YOU1000000044_S0001212	You can make your own and make like a interview style Going through those questions and record it and save it on a cloud
YOU1000000044_S0001213	And you can either share it or leave it privately, but that's I find it's a great way of preserving things that we were just talking about
YOU1000000044_S0001214	What I'm doing, I'm doing it with my son sometimes.
YOU1000000044_S0001215	So that way of preserving more of the way his ideas are changing through the time he's growing up.
YOU1000000044_S0001216	But lots of people are actually using it to talk with older generations, so it's not something to look into so called story corpse
YOU1000000044_S0001217	All right, I'll look into it also you're gonna find me crazy, but what if I told you I've actually met in my lifetime Three World War two veterans though. I've actually met three of them
YOU1000000044_S0001218	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001219	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0001220	I met the first one on the plane flight back from Seattle. It was after a plane touchdown in Atlanta.
YOU1000000044_S0001221	As we were getting off I just happened to glance over and saw his hat and shit showed he was a World War two veteran I mean, I mean I didn't say anything to him. I just saluted him
YOU1000000044_S0001222	And he actually turned to me and he smiled and I mean that I was glad I mean I because I mean I already knew those guys were starting to be forgotten
YOU1000000044_S0001223	because you know I think over I think it said over a thousand are dying each day.
YOU1000000044_S0001224	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0001225	which is unfortunate. But after that, I think the second one I met was, I met him, he was at a Home Depot.
YOU1000000044_S0001226	I think it was either in Commerce or Eastside in Georgia. I can't remember exactly where, but.
YOU1000000044_S0001227	I ended up talking to him and he actually showed me a picture of the plane he was assigned to.
YOU1000000044_S0001228	I think it was either a B-17 bomber or B-25. I can't remember exactly.
YOU1000000044_S0001229	but he and I were talking and I saluted him. I mean, anytime I see a war veteran, I salute them.
YOU1000000044_S0001231	And I mean, I was deeply impressed by what he had gone through. I mean,
YOU1000000044_S0001233	That was sort of an honor for me. I had never gotten a chance to talk to another war veteran.
YOU1000000044_S0001234	And the third one I've met was one who was able to attend our Veterans Day assembly at my school.
YOU1000000044_S0001235	And I spoke to him and a few other war veterans from other wars. And I mean, he was the oldest one there.
YOU1000000044_S0001237	But yeah, I mean that sort of never left me either and I mean I feel it kind of an honor that I was able to meet those guys because I mean they saw what true war was.
YOU1000000044_S0001239	And unfortunately, I mean, I know a lot of other veterans on other sides have seen far worse, unfortunately, which is, you know, like I say, you know,
YOU1000000044_S0001241	That's what I mean, you know, and just what those guys went through, you know, was enough. That's what I mean.
YOU1000000044_S0001242	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0001243	I mean, I've actually never met a World War II soldier who's actually been to like say Normandy or
YOU1000000044_S0001244	You know the ones who got what some of the guys who actually you know fought back through France but
YOU1000000044_S0001246	I mean, I don't know if they were, I don't know if they had been interviewed before or not, but still, I mean, like I said, that has stuck with me.
YOU1000000044_S0001247	Yeah, definitely a lot there of history for sure well. Thank you very much for all your stories. It's amazing. Yeah, you guys are amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001248	You lived a whole life already yes, and you are
YOU1000000044_S0001249	It is sets, but you never know, I might do a lot more.
YOU1000000044_S0001251	I've always said life is one of the greatest gifts God can give and it's up to each and every one of us to live our lives as best we can.
YOU1000000044_S0001252	I mean, and it's up to us to decide what's path to take in life.
YOU1000000044_S0001253	and you can either take the good path, make the right choices and make the right decision, and you'll end up living a happy long life.
YOU1000000044_S0001254	I mean, unfortunately for some, they just, people they just chose to take the bad path and they make the bad choices and unfortunately they...
YOU1000000044_S0001255	don't live very long lives and it's usually ones that they end up either regretting in the end or just are not happy with.
YOU1000000044_S0001256	That's very true, sir
YOU1000000044_S0001257	I mean the choice can't be forced. I mean it's our choice and choice it's our choice alone.

YOU1000000044_S0001306	Yeah, exactly we'll have a rotate because I know somebody like volcans gonna say oh, they're talking about it again I can hear him right now
YOU1000000044_S0001308	This is from our trip, my backpacking trip I did, and that's the different countries that I visited when I spent two weeks by train in Europe.
YOU1000000044_S0001309	But that one that you're asking about particularly that's Ljubljana, Slovenia
YOU1000000044_S0001310	And what I it was we each have a big picture behind one of the coaches here We each picked one of our favorites and Xenia pictures was from Iceland and
YOU1000000044_S0001311	And this was mine because I would just found it was one of the most beautiful places Surprisingly beautiful, I didn't think it was it could be that beautiful there, so
YOU1000000044_S0001312	That's why I picked that one to be the rest are all black and white from the other countries, but we did one color one each
YOU1000000044_S0001313	Yeah, we talked a little bit in the beginning of the stream about traveling and places in Europe and
YOU1000000044_S0001314	So if you have anything to add, please welcome and drop a comment.
YOU1000000044_S0001315	That's amazing so beautiful has also yes
YOU1000000044_S0001316	It's my go-to picture
YOU1000000044_S0001317	As I stated I never buy a souvenir the only souvenirs. I actually buy as I buy one fridge magnet in every country
YOU1000000044_S0001318	And that actually goes on my mom's fridge, because that was started as kind of a tradition.
YOU1000000044_S0001319	I'm not into souvenirs the pictures memories are my souvenirs, so I hold them very closely
YOU1000000044_S0001320	So every picture I look at around the room kind of tells a story or a moment in time From different travels
YOU1000000044_S0001321	some of the Xenia that we had some great adventures.
YOU1000000044_S0001322	Our first trip we ever did together was Estonia. We went to Talens which was absolutely incredible and
YOU1000000044_S0001323	It was about what it's an hour and a half right. I think yeah to Helsinki Finland
YOU1000000044_S0001324	And it was unbelievable. It was so amazing.
YOU1000000044_S0001325	I'll sink a Finland was actually one of my bucket list places. I always picked the cold ones, which is weird coming from Canada, but
YOU1000000044_S0001326	Is it warm this evening in California hazel yeah, I was cute so my parting tip always shoot a second take
YOU1000000044_S0001327	My second take saved me from a reshoot last night. Definitely sure glad I had the footage. Oh, you got that right.
YOU1000000044_S0001328	The video I just did recently a biker bush kind of know if you've seen it. She brought back the 80s to Montreal and
YOU1000000044_S0001329	There's some panning shots of the city my poor son I think he was gonna pull it he's here at one point because we're literally down there for two hours and
YOU1000000044_S0001330	And we ended up with over 50 some shots of each section Just because it's that time of evening when it's hard to guess what the lighting is going to be like
YOU1000000044_S0001331	Once you put it through the editing box and like you say they do get lost so yes definitely always back up everything
YOU1000000044_S0001332	Now maybe you'll go and shoot it even better But most times yeah, you'll never recreate that moment so definitely double up
YOU1000000044_S0001333	Triple up a weekend
YOU1000000044_S0001334	That's the beauty of the digital technologies now that we can do that.
YOU1000000044_S0001335	You know when we were using eight millimeters
YOU1000000044_S0001336	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0001337	Or filming the camera for photos, unfortunately you weren't able to do that. Fortunately or fortunately, some might say.
YOU1000000044_S0001338	Or as many pictures possible, and if you can do it, and then you can choose the best one
YOU1000000044_S0001339	Even forget a photographer just somebody went to a wedding and they're sitting there with a roll of their film And you know the 35 millimeter. We all remember what that was like you know
YOU1000000044_S0001340	You're waiting and waiting and waiting for that perfect shot because you only had three shots left on your camera
YOU1000000044_S0001342	Yeah, I like that like your bushcraft, lol everyone is perfect until you are in post. How true is that?
YOU1000000044_S0001343	This is this is a killer shot till you get home, and it looks absolutely horrible or you lost it That it that's the truth
YOU1000000044_S0001344	Many professionals say I think two is a you have to do the most preparation before the shot as possible
YOU1000000044_S0001345	The most you can do before is better. If there is something you can do in post, great.
YOU1000000044_S0001346	But the more you do with the light with composition with the way you're moving your camera though like everything which you can do before it and make sure before you actually shoot if it's possible
YOU1000000044_S0001347	Preparation is a key lots of preparation You know and and it's scouting the place out if I had a new place that I wanted to shoot I'll definitely walk all around it
YOU1000000044_S0001348	I'll look for things that are gonna look horrible later on in film I've seen myself picking up garbage by a train yard one time literally I picked up probably 25 pieces and
YOU1000000044_S0001349	But of course litter was blowing off the highway, and yes, you might notice it so much when you're looking through the camera
YOU1000000044_S0001350	Like like biker says hmm that it really sticks out in the post
YOU1000000044_S0001351	And that's an awful thing when you put all the two, three hours work into something just to bring it back and it's all non-usable.
YOU1000000044_S0001353	Definitely and I think it's the details that makes a difference as you said picking up the garbage. Yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001354	Is noticing these details that might be distracting in your video or your photo, and I'm getting rid of them
YOU1000000044_S0001355	Or making it just a little bit different. You know those details is what makes the difference
YOU1000000044_S0001356	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0001357	when you watch the video or a photo.
YOU1000000044_S0001358	I don't do as much photography as any but I when I take photos I kind of do the same as I do with video
YOU1000000044_S0001359	The windmill train that was brought up a while ago That's a great example. There's a shot in the town where I grew up Cascopedia where it's looking the train is crossing the truss old bridge and
YOU1000000044_S0001360	There was lots of open places to shoot it, but it was so much more interesting I went down by the bank, and you have poplar trees that were kind of intertwined a bit and
YOU1000000044_S0001361	I'd bend back a couple of them I try not to break them if I didn't have to So when I shot I'd have some trees in front of it. You know some nice little branches
YOU1000000044_S0001362	And and that's so many people try to go for this like crystal clear unobstructed view
YOU1000000044_S0001363	But when you shoot like that you have just a couple of branches here and there it gives you that peeping feel that people love like they're they've found something special and
YOU1000000044_S0001364	and it really, really brings out your shot. It makes the subject so much more interesting.
YOU1000000044_S0001365	You're gonna remember that the shot that is taken in a from standing and eye level is the most common shot you're gonna ever see anywhere
YOU1000000044_S0001366	Yes.
YOU1000000044_S0001367	So when, before you're taking a video or a photo, think about that.
YOU1000000044_S0001368	If you're standing and you're doing this probably thousand two thousand three thousand people already did that especially if it's somewhere in the tourist place
YOU1000000044_S0001369	So once you do this remember that and try to go either lower or or in a different angle That's a good point. Yes, just so it's different
YOU1000000044_S0001370	Because after even with the best post edit there's gonna be thousands of pictures of a straight-up Lake Louise straight-up Grand Canyon
YOU1000000044_S0001371	and all the other places it could ever imagine.
YOU1000000044_S0001372	Definitely.
YOU1000000044_S0001373	So yes, when you think this, move.
YOU1000000044_S0001374	Yes, shoot under your leg.
YOU1000000044_S0001375	Blurry in one corner will give it more perspective because the angle was shot from versus a straight on one. That's crystal clear
YOU1000000044_S0001376	Video I almost always shoot as well as my camera as well, but I'm almost always shooting at chest level
YOU1000000044_S0001377	That's the kind of give of in-between view of child and adult most animals would see from that perspective
YOU1000000044_S0001378	So I think it's the most relatable to most people that are watching your work Now is that always the case? time will tell but
YOU1000000044_S0001379	For me, I just found that's kind of what's worked the best for myself.
YOU1000000044_S0001381	Another tip for taking pictures by the way, it's undermined because you were saying about the chest level
YOU1000000044_S0001382	If you want to have a nice and clear picture Try to hold the camera not in a straight out hands, but as close as possible to your body
YOU1000000044_S0001383	Basically, your body is a tripod.
YOU1000000044_S0001384	Yeah, definitely, for sure.
YOU1000000044_S0001385	Lots of people do they they do this because now we can see the back of the screen with a view so we want to see what is there right?
YOU1000000044_S0001386	Don't do that. That's where your hands start to get shaky.
YOU1000000044_S0001387	You got no control.
YOU1000000044_S0001388	No control at all the closer you are to your body with it the better the picture Yeah, the video is because it works like a tripod
YOU1000000044_S0001389	Yes, us fanboy talk once again. We'll bring up Peter McKenna. He gave a great example for how he was doing the dropping shots
YOU1000000044_S0001390	Was to put the camera strap around your neck hold your camera out so that way you do have some support already You know you don't want it too far away for you
YOU1000000044_S0001391	Which is usually for most people when they pick up their camera You can shoot and just on one foot just let yourself pivot ahead
YOU1000000044_S0001392	Three seconds, but you could actually catch a lot in that two three seconds
YOU1000000044_S0001393	and you get a nice panning shot, so if you want to like a flower or Maybe a small brook somewhere, and you want to get that nice panning shot is doing that
YOU1000000044_S0001394	Just let yourself standing on one foot and let yourself just lightly go ahead on your own momentum and you can really get some great shot.
YOU1000000044_S0001395	And do that from different angles hold the camera up with you with the sling the strap and just turn it slowly
YOU1000000044_S0001396	You're not gonna be able to keep it forever, but you'll you know you always know you keep that little bit of steady momentum as you do it and That really helps a lot
YOU1000000044_S0001398	Casel is asking if we're carrying around charged batteries.
YOU1000000044_S0001399	Definitely all kinds of charge batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001400	Let me count. Okay, so one is always in the camera charge.
YOU1000000044_S0001401	Every time I come back from somewhere where I got to shoot I come back and I charge right away the camp there the batteries
YOU1000000044_S0001402	That's just a given so there's always one charge inside, and I think I have four or five yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001403	Never a shortage of them. That's for sure
YOU1000000044_S0001404	Because we sometimes shoot weddings and believe me I go through all of them and sometimes even need to charge extra
YOU1000000044_S0001405	And that's lithium batteries of a sonic hammer that I'm using
YOU1000000044_S0001406	So that's a lot that's a lot of batteries to go through in an eight hours sometimes
YOU1000000044_S0001407	But And why by the way because oftentimes as a wedding photographer or event photographer who go to baptism which is a very important thing
YOU1000000044_S0001408	which by the way, we'll have a shoot on this Sunday, next Sunday.
YOU1000000044_S0001409	I don't want to lose a shot so I oftentimes just keep the shutter open and just wait for the right moment.
YOU1000000044_S0001410	I don't want to lose the emotion or the face expression, so I just keep it open obviously batteries draining as I'm doing that and
YOU1000000044_S0001411	That's why sometimes go through five six of them during the event
YOU1000000044_S0001412	But yes, we definitely always always extra charging batteries even with the phone charger is always with me and we charge it in the car
YOU1000000044_S0001413	Because I don't you know my enough for being able to talk to it But to take pictures even with the phone where I don't have my camera with me. What about you?
YOU1000000044_S0001414	Me I keep I have four batteries and mine's a bit tricky for the simple reason The controller is my cell phone. That's how that one is controlled
YOU1000000044_S0001415	So I have to keep extra batteries for a cell phone plus extra batteries for the camera itself
YOU1000000044_S0001416	The four lithium batteries for the camera as soon as one runs out. I'm literally plugging it in and charging it
YOU1000000044_S0001417	I will try all day. I'll plan it out so when we do a wedding I'll look around and see the different areas We're gonna be filming where the plugins are available, and I always try and reserve them in advance
YOU1000000044_S0001418	I'll ask the DJ or I'll ask the concierge whoever has any control over them to at least save me one
YOU1000000044_S0001419	I'd never take a chance. I I should get more batteries really and
YOU1000000044_S0001420	Four seems to work okay, because I've always been lucky to plug them in but at some point my locks gonna run out
YOU1000000044_S0001421	And it does you never know when magic moves we had a wedding one time well the one with Jeffrey and them
YOU1000000044_S0001422	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0001423	And I thought they were pretty much done with us and then all of a sudden they decided these mother-in-law was giving them this gift And they were on film
YOU1000000044_S0001424	And just by the grace of God, I had enough battery left in the last battery to get the shot.
YOU1000000044_S0001425	maybe not as many as I would have liked to, but at least we got it covered.
YOU1000000044_S0001426	Things creep on you really quickly and you've got to be prepared for everything and batteries is the key.
YOU1000000044_S0001427	batteries and SD cards
YOU1000000044_S0001428	Because SD cards can crap out at you at any time you can shoot a lot more footage than you were ever expecting to shoot
YOU1000000044_S0001429	I actually keep mine in a glasses case not for these glasses once I had before
YOU1000000044_S0001430	Snap close type that come with them that we usually never use Well that one and that's where I keep all my SD cards And I keep all my little bits that I need for that kind of stuff
YOU1000000044_S0001431	Bulk is asking
YOU1000000044_S0001432	Okay, you you okay you have you have watched a variety of my videos now. I want you to tell me what I'm doing wrong
YOU1000000044_S0001433	And that's the thing I think we're all asking each other. I know it's not it sounds like kind of a generic answer
YOU1000000044_S0001434	I don't think you're doing anything wrong Like you say I mean we're not aces either. We're still learning and I mean we've gotten some really great compliments, and I appreciate it
YOU1000000044_S0001436	Lot of it's been the marketing our site that really is just getting people to watch it That's been the biggest part of all for growing
YOU1000000044_S0001437	You got you got interesting content. I don't see why people wouldn't be interested into it It depends what you want to edit like I mean you know you can edit it
YOU1000000044_S0001438	It does it is more of a learning curve than others people that are light years ahead of me but.
YOU1000000044_S0001439	But it is a lot more work. And so it takes, you know, and you need to make sure you have a decent computer for it.
YOU1000000044_S0001440	It's a lot a lot and the same with exam with photography a lot of YouTube tutorial tutorials
YOU1000000044_S0001441	Trying either to learn what I need. I'll think okay. Well. I want this the flash and turn and do whatever and
YOU1000000044_S0001442	I'm on YouTube and looking for somebody who has done it already or something at least close enough
YOU1000000044_S0001443	And also watching my spare time to always look to see what somebody else is doing
YOU1000000044_S0001444	And it's an art all in itself editing, you know, and there's people who edit who are horrible at taking video and
YOU1000000044_S0001445	And that's what's tricky about what we all do here. And we got to remember that we have people here who love working with wood.
YOU1000000044_S0001446	But now all of a sudden they also have to learn how to be video photographers. They have to learn how to be editors. They got to learn how to read analytics in YouTube.
YOU1000000044_S0001447	We wear so many hats now.
YOU1000000044_S0001448	We all wish kind of sometimes we had somebody Myself taking video with my camera. I do enjoy it now more I
YOU1000000044_S0001449	I like to do my videography
YOU1000000044_S0001450	But I'd be more than happy if somebody was shooting this stuff here like we could hire somebody doing that and I was sitting here Just editing because that's where I feel the most creative
YOU1000000044_S0001451	Now some people the exact opposite they'll shoot for days They have such an amazing eye, and they would rather cut off their own arm than have to do any video editing
YOU1000000044_S0001452	Or marketing on YouTube it's a whole package, and you see what I'm typing in
YOU1000000044_S0001453	Hazel, we're not experts.
YOU1000000044_S0001454	You're too kind
YOU1000000044_S0001456	We're just trying to help each other and the same as we learn from other people what we are doing you know if anybody have questions doesn't mean that we have perfect answers I wouldn't call us
YOU1000000044_S0001457	And if you have something that you can do that we've forgotten or know more about please I'm all ears We would love to the whole point is for us to learn as well
YOU1000000044_S0001459	I have some more question, but they never got back to me kind of lag in the chat system
YOU1000000044_S0001460	I would say so usually there is at any given time you
YOU1000000044_S0001462	Yeah, I think we answered all your questions. By the way, I wanted to address your channel in general and please don't start
YOU1000000044_S0001464	Wanted to tell you just one thing and I know you don't want to hear about marketing. You know how I remembered your channel
YOU1000000044_S0001465	Remembered your channel on out of all of the thousands that we watched is hard sometimes to remember which is which and you've got to go back again and again
YOU1000000044_S0001466	But what really struck the stroke of chord is a thumbnail of your video of Gillies Bay
YOU1000000044_S0001467	There with a yeah with a bird I thought the shot itself as a photographer first of all I thought it was amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001468	I'm like I remember Andrew was showing me the your channel. I'm like oh my god. Look at that I like I I couldn't believe the shot
YOU1000000044_S0001469	But what I'm saying when I'm looking at all your videos all together it jumps out that thumbnail is just like oh my god I want to see what's there
YOU1000000044_S0001470	Yep.
YOU1000000044_S0001471	And I think you should have that as an example to the rest of your videos. Yeah, have your thumbnails like that
YOU1000000044_S0001472	You have your channel's name on them, which is great.
YOU1000000044_S0001473	But these capturing thumbnails like you have in these Gillies Bay video thumbnail Do them like that on the rest of your videos
YOU1000000044_S0001474	It's amazing. I'm telling you as a professional photographer. I I couldn't I couldn't believe my eyes I needed to see it up close and and that's how I remembered it
YOU1000000044_S0001475	And that's why I was coming back and watching other videos because of that thumbnail
YOU1000000044_S0001476	Thumbnails are so important, and we all kind of make that mistake at the beginning, and I've been there many times
YOU1000000044_S0001477	The thumbnails that you see for our videos. I've redone them. I think it's four times now Yeah to get them where I want to get them
YOU1000000044_S0001478	One of my favorite ones is the one of the latest ones we did was the train in the fog in Kingston, Ontario
YOU1000000044_S0001479	Before I would have taken a screenshot. It would have been further back and
YOU1000000044_S0001480	Yes, you could see the train. Yes, you could probably guess there was a bit of fog in there
YOU1000000044_S0001481	But now if you look at it,
YOU1000000044_S0001482	Because the thumbnail is smaller I Had a I take the shot bring it into Photoshop the first thing I do is I up the contrast a lot and
YOU1000000044_S0001483	Because it's smaller. I really wanted to punch then I bring up the blocks so the shadows. I still want you to see detail, but
YOU1000000044_S0001484	But I'm gonna get it to the exact point the sweetest spot where it says jet black as can be where you can still make out what's in there
YOU1000000044_S0001485	And then I the fog was actually oh My god, I feel like it's gonna be a drinking game soon if I bring up Peter McKinnon one more time
YOU1000000044_S0001486	We were watching and he was showing about how to do a motion blur to give your picture more depth
YOU1000000044_S0001487	I've done that before But I hadn't done it in so long and I seen it and two days later I was working on the thumbnail for that. I thought that's it. That's what I'm missing
YOU1000000044_S0001488	So I took the shot then layered on top of each other and then I added the motion blur to it and then I added the motion blur to it
YOU1000000044_S0001489	And then started as a layer mask cleaning it out and gave it that mask where the train comes punching through the fog.
YOU1000000044_S0001490	Because people aren't going to see the big picture that you're working on to at the time.
YOU1000000044_S0001491	Like you see on the screen. They're literally seeing this at the best of times
YOU1000000044_S0001492	High-res very very high Contrast pictures is what works great
YOU1000000044_S0001493	The seagull like you nailed it there really nailed it and use that as your example and go back and do your thumbnails
YOU1000000044_S0001494	I know it's your bottle cap logo. I like it. It's very punchy and it's very
YOU1000000044_S0001495	Would almost so consider maybe finding the spot that you like to use it and use it the same place in all your photos
YOU1000000044_S0001496	Like if you notice ours has pushed the students with the white band across the bottom and usually the 4k on top
YOU1000000044_S0001497	The photo series or the the hour-long trains I couldn't make it into 4k it was too long
YOU1000000044_S0001498	And all it is is one Photoshop document. I back it up of course.
YOU1000000044_S0001499	But with every layer is all of them for those thumbnails
YOU1000000044_S0001500	I always just go in and add a new layer or a new folder in that and work on that
YOU1000000044_S0001501	So everything always stays in the same uniform scale every time.
YOU1000000044_S0001502	The banner is always in the same place and the only thing that changes the layers behind it
YOU1000000044_S0001503	Maybe you can share screens on one of his videos if you really want to hear him
YOU1000000044_S0001504	Yeah
YOU1000000044_S0001505	Well we're gonna ask him first, okay minds bottle caps would you mind if we opened up one of your videos to look at
YOU1000000044_S0001506	it's up to you you don't have to we understand completely if you'd like to or not and If there's a certain video you'd like us to look at just let us know
YOU1000000044_S0001508	I definitely wouldn't do that without your permission.
YOU1000000044_S0001509	Yes, you're right. Cazel also agrees with us that the thumbnail with the birds really jumps at us. That's right, exactly.
YOU1000000044_S0001510	As I said, that's how I remember their channel bottle caps
YOU1000000044_S0001511	You're saying that you have a huge photograph hanging on the wall of a bald-headed eagle.
YOU1000000044_S0001512	Bringing a gift to the drone thousand feet up a dead duck in it Oh my god, but I would love to see that
YOU1000000044_S0001513	That's amazing You have the content already
YOU1000000044_S0001514	You were saying the other day that your videos are only for local people.
YOU1000000044_S0001515	No, we are as I said we live there. I'm interested in your videos. Thanks
YOU1000000044_S0001516	We're all local I mean our work. I mean is mostly based in Montreal and in the United States
YOU1000000044_S0001517	tiny a town of 280 some in eastern Quebec and People who are commenting. I mean just once again the analytics show where they're looking from around the world so
YOU1000000044_S0001518	You'll have some great views.
YOU1000000044_S0001520	Mm-hmm.
YOU1000000044_S0001522	Sure, I don't. I sure don't care. Ball caps, you're amazing.
YOU1000000044_S0001524	Okay, already there.
YOU1000000044_S0001526	He's amazing, I swear to God. Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001527	The latest one
YOU1000000044_S0001528	Yep. OK, just give me a second to get that out. Go ahead, no problem.
YOU1000000044_S0001530	and
YOU1000000044_S0001532	And again, it's just suggestions. We're not experts.
YOU1000000044_S0001533	No, and we're not bashing, but I mean we don't have all the answers I mean, I'm sure people look at our second God. What are they doing? You know you can't please everybody
YOU1000000044_S0001534	You look like Jack Nicholson are you talking about my husband? Amazing resemblance
YOU1000000044_S0001535	Let me look.
YOU1000000044_S0001536	I'm gonna be looking through a different set of eyes now
YOU1000000044_S0001538	Movie
YOU1000000044_S0001540	Okay, so let's see I'm just gonna bear with me. I want to get this set up
YOU1000000044_S0001542	This will be another first.
YOU1000000044_S0001544	Application screen. Share.
YOU1000000044_S0001545	Okay, now we're gonna try this sound. I hope this works, okay?
YOU1000000044_S0001547	Great shot.
YOU1000000044_S0001549	Great opening shot.
YOU1000000044_S0001551	That opening shot is absolutely, I don't see any problem with it.
YOU1000000044_S0001552	I love the movement. I love the pause in the beginning the composition of the shot the setup is great and
YOU1000000044_S0001553	I would work a little bit on the histogram
YOU1000000044_S0001554	That's why I said shot specifically meaning that the direction you were going into I knew exactly would talk about color and
YOU1000000044_S0001555	As you notice right here in this spot, you can see that there's no
YOU1000000044_S0001557	So you can see the only thing right now is you're missing is some definition between your clouds your water and your grass
YOU1000000044_S0001558	It's a nice shot and really it's not a ton of He doesn't need to rebuild it or anything. It's just it's just bringing up your blocks a bit more
YOU1000000044_S0001559	You know it's around the grass here that the the the the water side grass it would make them more defined that way
YOU1000000044_S0001560	Me personally I would boost up your blacks a bit and Even though it's a nice blue sky that I would bring back maybe even a bit of a yellow tint just a tiny bit
YOU1000000044_S0001561	Just to kind of bring a little little little bit of life into the plants that are there or try your greens a bit better
YOU1000000044_S0001562	But usually yellow gives you a more cinematic look, but you don't add much of it, and that's a big key This is a side note
YOU1000000044_S0001563	That happens a lot where people get crazy with the slider. They start moving it left right as far as they can go
YOU1000000044_S0001564	Almost everything you do should be within maybe what 10% yeah, I would say is a good number to keep in mind
YOU1000000044_S0001565	It won't even look recognizable anymore
YOU1000000044_S0001566	Yeah, uh, yeah, my suggestion would be bringing the highlights a little bit down and bringing the shadows a little bit up and
YOU1000000044_S0001567	Trick in getting the detail, but not getting your shot too too dark is getting your shadows a little bit up
YOU1000000044_S0001568	It's not gonna be enough to blow it out completely
YOU1000000044_S0001569	But it's gonna give that nice detail in in the darkest parts as for example in your trees here
YOU1000000044_S0001570	That would be more visible right and
YOU1000000044_S0001571	I would even say they're great
YOU1000000044_S0001572	But right here if you would just put the highlights a little bit down I
YOU1000000044_S0001573	I would be able to see more of the water and more of the clouds, more of that beautiful, beautiful scenery in the background there.
YOU1000000044_S0001574	So yeah, so that's what I would say with regards to that. Now we can play it along again. Where are we? Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001576	Yeah, beautiful movement the composition of the shot is amazing
YOU1000000044_S0001578	And you see right away here, you're doing what a lot of people are doing online.
YOU1000000044_S0001579	not to degrade your work, saying that you don't need to feel like you've made some sort of abomination.
YOU1000000044_S0001580	Look at the past one with the birds like a little bit of contrast those birds will pop right under the water
YOU1000000044_S0001582	You are great shot here
YOU1000000044_S0001583	Nice speed not too fast not too slow amazing. I
YOU1000000044_S0001584	Here's oh right here. Here's what I would avoid and this is common with most drone shots Everything was flowing. I'm gonna put this back
YOU1000000044_S0001585	Let me see even a bit further because I want to catch this where it happens Now you see the flow you had since you left land
YOU1000000044_S0001586	And you went out there beautiful right here where you're starting to turn that's where I would fade out
YOU1000000044_S0001587	I would never keep that turn in there. And as you turn here, once you straighten out and you find your angle that you're going at,
YOU1000000044_S0001589	That's where I would be bringing the video back in Like here like let's go back see how you're kind of panning up here slowly
YOU1000000044_S0001590	You could use that as a shot, cutting out all the middle between where I had stopped in here.
YOU1000000044_S0001591	Like this is nice. It's getting...
YOU1000000044_S0001593	Problem with drones, and this has been a big big argument for a while
YOU1000000044_S0001595	If you're making a video and you just want to show flying a drone in an area, leave it. It's good.
YOU1000000044_S0001596	If you want to make it more cinematic, think of all the movies you've ever seen where there's been a lifted camera.
YOU1000000044_S0001597	They never show all the turnings because I mean a drone is not a perfect turn when it does one. It's very very disjointed
YOU1000000044_S0001598	It doesn't quite know where to go. It's standing out.
YOU1000000044_S0001599	Remember when I said even with my camera I never shoot a building if I want it straight on I always start away from it and pan across it
YOU1000000044_S0001600	Because I'll actually cut out that beginning part where I started and it's a little bit jittery and wait till the movement is fluid And that's where I'll start my video
YOU1000000044_S0001601	Where it starts to get kind of going the same way at the end. That's where I'll cut it off
YOU1000000044_S0001602	That makes tons and tons and tons of difference in your footage.
YOU1000000044_S0001603	You got great footage right here in this turn you can use that and then maybe cut it again afterwards
YOU1000000044_S0001605	See, like this is beautiful panning shots like this you can use.
YOU1000000044_S0001607	But you got to separate them when it looks like it's moving off and the drone is studying itself cut it out and then you can cut it out
YOU1000000044_S0001608	Maybe you'll have to skip five seconds, but at least we'll have good footage, and then you can show here
YOU1000000044_S0001609	So sometimes without I would do is the first turn and then say there was a bit of a jitteriness and then another nice turn But almost the same level
YOU1000000044_S0001610	I would actually take that next I've cut out the bad part and the next one I would zoom in maybe a
YOU1000000044_S0001612	Zoom out as well 20% so it doesn't look like the same cut because then it looks like a jump shot where it's the same view
YOU1000000044_S0001613	So bring it in a bit more or bring it out a bit more.
YOU1000000044_S0001615	Yeah, you definitely detail a color look at all that color in the water like I I just want to punch in it, you know
YOU1000000044_S0001616	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0001617	A bunch of that blue and green would bring so much life in it right away.
YOU1000000044_S0001618	Also all the details in the woods there, they're just screaming to get out.
YOU1000000044_S0001619	Yep, no.
YOU1000000044_S0001621	You would be able to see so much also underneath the water the the the bed water bed
YOU1000000044_S0001622	And if you would go down in the highlights right here in this shot, you would be able to see much more of the things under the water.
YOU1000000044_S0001624	You know okay see here where the camera got jittery right here That's where I would have cut that part out, and then maybe start here if you have enough distance in the stays smooth
YOU1000000044_S0001625	Cut cut out all your jittery parts, and then you have them on the timeline and from there You have all your good cuts figure out how you work them into the music
YOU1000000044_S0001627	Music is key you want everything to follow the beat you can zoom in and see every note how it goes up and down and You'll see a pattern into it
YOU1000000044_S0001628	And from there you can really sync it up with the music and that's the biggest key to building something really great really quick
YOU1000000044_S0001629	I'm just gonna put this I'm gonna try something here control. This is not the best way to do it But we're gonna try it control
YOU1000000044_S0001630	Uh, Christian.
YOU1000000044_S0001631	I don't know if this will even work, but you know what we're gonna try something here tonight. We're gonna try something new
YOU1000000044_S0001632	You can still see the chart right on
YOU1000000044_S0001633	Yep.
YOU1000000044_S0001634	Okay.
YOU1000000044_S0001636	Now this is not the high-res version of what you did. I just took a screen capture.
YOU1000000044_S0001638	But we're going to try this, so bear with us.
YOU1000000044_S0001640	There's your shot.
YOU1000000044_S0001642	Control L. Let's even just try, and this is, we're doing this in Photoshop because it's a picture obviously, but I'm just gonna try auto levels just for the fun of it.
YOU1000000044_S0001644	So we're just gonna yeah, I'm just gonna bring up the color. I'm just gonna bring up the saturation a little bit
YOU1000000044_S0001645	You guys see that?
YOU1000000044_S0001647	I can't see it here.
YOU1000000044_S0001648	You can't see it?
YOU1000000044_S0001649	Bye.
YOU1000000044_S0001651	Can you see anything on your stream?
YOU1000000044_S0001653	It was working, let's just I'm gonna go back. Yeah, no oh, okay, so it's not working
YOU1000000044_S0001654	Think it's just because of the bandwidth we tried it today quickly. I tried to it quickly, and it was working I'm gonna try once more. Let's just
YOU1000000044_S0001656	We're just gonna try it one more time and see cuz this is hard to do and I've been reading that a lot of people
YOU1000000044_S0001657	That's why I want to go to the other program soon. Just having a chance to set it up yet. I may will get there
YOU1000000044_S0001659	Let's see if that's where it's showing up on here.
YOU1000000044_S0001661	Still live up there. Yeah. Yep. Okay
YOU1000000044_S0001663	Yeah, so honey, do you want to do because you're more the color person you want to do
YOU1000000044_S0001664	Auto just show the easy way of doing it it doesn't really need a lot of it's not making
YOU1000000044_S0001665	I'm just gonna bring up the bottom levels a little bit
YOU1000000044_S0001666	Look already the blocks coming out to the bar, and then we'll just play with the mids a little bit We'll just pull them back
YOU1000000044_S0001668	Maybe I will do a separate live where I can go through with a tutorial of how to get your picture punchier.
YOU1000000044_S0001669	Yeah.
YOU1000000044_S0001671	I can do a short one maybe one day.
YOU1000000044_S0001672	You see if you bring all the situations black, but if you just raise the saturation a little bit You know your colors are already coming back, and you can on the lightness
YOU1000000044_S0001673	Now remember like I say this is a low-res version because I just took a screenshot, so it is quite hard to work with
YOU1000000044_S0001675	But it doesn't take much. It really, it's just playing with it, you know.
YOU1000000044_S0001677	Already your trees are coming out more. I should have made a copy of it, but let's see here you
YOU1000000044_S0001679	There's the beginning.
YOU1000000044_S0001681	You can see already the buildings coming out more and stuff like that and like I said, this is just a very very fast edit on the fly
YOU1000000044_S0001682	Right and and like I said the composition on the flow of the video is amazing but I
YOU1000000044_S0001683	If you toggle between before and after you can see how much punchier the
YOU1000000044_S0001685	It just grabs the eye more so bottle caps you were talking the other day about TV viewer attention and that you need more hours and that people subscribe and leave
YOU1000000044_S0001686	But these are the things that keep them staying
YOU1000000044_S0001687	This is what keeps them watching your video to the end This is what keeps them not just subscribing but watching this video and then going to the next one and next one next one
YOU1000000044_S0001688	Because your videos are amazing. I love drones. Who doesn't my god and and your movement of it is amazing definitely
YOU1000000044_S0001689	And like I say once again, it's about your editing best way to make it easier for self lay all your files out in your editor and
YOU1000000044_S0001690	What you don't need what looks bad if you have 20 seconds and five of its jittery cut out the jittery and start from there and
YOU1000000044_S0001691	and see what you can put together.
YOU1000000044_S0001692	Of course you're saying well tabs that you're just taking the SD card basically putting it in the computer and uploading
YOU1000000044_S0001693	It's a great way of doing it
YOU1000000044_S0001694	But if you want those viewing hours that these are little details that count a lot and would make a world of difference
YOU1000000044_S0001695	Just even a 10-minute work on your video Would would make a difference. I promise you yeah, I promise you start now
YOU1000000044_S0001696	You have all the elements already have everything else already working for you ten minutes, and it's gonna be so much worth it
YOU1000000044_S0001698	Try it for your next video and then get back to us and and and see how it went Okay
YOU1000000044_S0001700	I see lots of people have drones here, Maverick as well.
YOU1000000044_S0001701	I like that you guys are getting in Matt cook or for Oregon. Oh, I'm so glad to have you back tonight And yeah, I knew you were wanting to get more into the details of stuff like that
YOU1000000044_S0001703	Please you have any questions as well like I say I don't know if we can answer them all you do some nice work
YOU1000000044_S0001704	But anything or any advice for us as well or for anybody here to everybody were just sharing thoughts and stuff like that
YOU1000000044_S0001705	That's the nice part about this. It's nothing formal
YOU1000000044_S0001706	For sure if anybody else I want to jump in and have any advice and please
YOU1000000044_S0001707	If anybody haven't subscribed yet to bottle caps go over do that if you like his videos
YOU1000000044_S0001708	And please view the videos. Yes, the videos. They're really really beautiful
YOU1000000044_S0001710	Oh, oh, Matt here to your to call a new car But thank you so much. I mean we're just learning as we go
YOU1000000044_S0001711	We're just watching every YouTube tutorial there is
YOU1000000044_S0001712	I know we go on a lot about Peter McKinnon. Yes, he's Canadian, so we're a little biased.
YOU1000000044_S0001713	But what we liked about him and a lot of people say oh, he's just a Casey copycat. He's not
YOU1000000044_S0001714	The thing he's doing that Casey didn't do Casey was all about flash, and I'm not knocking him and hey he did great for it
YOU1000000044_S0001715	But he doesn't hold a candle in the wind when it comes to actual cinematography Casey's an amazing storyteller
YOU1000000044_S0001716	They're all great their own rights. I'm not turning it into a pissing contest between them all I'm just saying is for what we do We really appreciate well Peter does it?
YOU1000000044_S0001717	Blowing his nose and turned into a cinematic event yeah from the tissue to gets in the garbage You would be hooked on every moment of it
YOU1000000044_S0001718	That's a talent.
YOU1000000044_S0001719	And that's what it is is looking through and that's what I say. We're cutting out all the bad jittery shots
YOU1000000044_S0001720	That's what takes somebody imagine if you were at a concert hearing your favorite singer of all time which we have and They have an off night
YOU1000000044_S0001721	It's they're singing the song and they're going the way it should be and then they hit that one flat note and then they get going again, and they hit one more flat note
YOU1000000044_S0001722	Well, they sung hundreds of notes But it's that flat note that just knocks everything off kilter, and that's not you being picky. That's a physical element of us
YOU1000000044_S0001724	Yeah, exactly. It's the details. It's the details.
YOU1000000044_S0001725	We lay out a video like I've been or eggs any with a picture
YOU1000000044_S0001726	When we do a wedding, she and I both spend a good couple of days.
YOU1000000044_S0001727	A wedding for Xenia usually involves three to four thousand pictures taken in eight hours. That's no joke.
YOU1000000044_S0001728	So it's a week just weeding out what pictures are horrible right away. Yeah, this is blurry. Yeah, that's shaky Yeah, I don't take 15 of the same shot this week
YOU1000000044_S0001729	The photos after the event is probably the most tedious and most boring
YOU1000000044_S0001730	I don't want to do it so ball caps. I don't like pulling my photos
YOU1000000044_S0001731	But in order to get to the part that I do like doing and to get the end results of the pictures I have to
YOU1000000044_S0001732	So I spend hours and hours of cooling those thousands of thousands of pictures to get through them and choose the ones that I am liking and clients is gonna like
YOU1000000044_S0001733	When we do when we're shooting the wedding the same for me. I mean I've seen myself in
YOU1000000044_S0001735	SD cards full and those are 64 gig cards So there is a lot of footage to go through and I'm gonna show you a little bit of footage
YOU1000000044_S0001736	And it's tedious and video sometimes even worse because at least before you can kind of jump You know with your viewer on the jpeg viewer to at least get rid of the bad ones right away
YOU1000000044_S0001737	I gotta watch these things in 4k that suck up so much juice out of a computer Just to get in two minutes down the road realize just how horrible the whole thing was cuz I'm not gonna lie
YOU1000000044_S0001738	I've shot it 30 different ways in that angle and 15 ways in this angle.
YOU1000000044_S0001739	It sometimes takes me a night just to do one building sometimes That that's the price we pay for trying to get the best shot out of it
YOU1000000044_S0001740	And we'll weed through them, and I've seen myself have to go back and dig through my scraps again because I'm short on time.
YOU1000000044_S0001741	I need to angle or once I got in the editor. I'm realizing. Oh my god. That was bad at the end I thought this one was good
YOU1000000044_S0001742	So I got a chop it there and then find something else to piece in between or it does it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it
YOU1000000044_S0001743	What drives me the craziest is a shot that's one second away from matching with the music.
YOU1000000044_S0001744	Or do I have to scrap it all and put in two shots or find a better shot to fit?
YOU1000000044_S0001745	It's mixing and matching. It's like playing Tetris for a couple of days.
YOU1000000044_S0001747	Yeah, and of course you know you don't have to go into the deep editing of the stuff if that's not what you want to do But sometimes just a light touch is great
YOU1000000044_S0001748	Yeah, there's a happy medium in all this.
YOU1000000044_S0001749	I mean in this stuff we're paid for it, and then also what we're doing a customer will be watching So we're kind of having to keep ourselves in check
YOU1000000044_S0001750	And we're our own worst critics. I mean we constantly we said the other night are telling each other that
YOU1000000044_S0001751	80% of it is our work and the other 20% is telling the other one that they're going too far into this and you got to just accept it and move on
YOU1000000044_S0001752	You know it's like a good good bowl of soup just a little bit of salt. It's gonna make world of a difference
YOU1000000044_S0001753	Mm-hmm and it is the little touches that make Watch lots of people who do tutorials and again just look for great ideas
YOU1000000044_S0001754	There's so many out there. That's what we use all the time And it does make a difference it really does and they're doing it step by step so you always got a good reference
