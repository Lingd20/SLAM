POD1000000005_S0000000	HEY FRIENDS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHEN I WAS A KID, I KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT MONEY.
POD1000000005_S0000001	WELL, THERE'S A NEW SHOW FROM MARKETPLACE AND BRAINS ON THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS JUST THAT.
POD1000000005_S0000002	MILLION BAZILLION IS A NEW PODCAST FOR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.
POD1000000005_S0000003	HOW IT WORKS, HOW WE USE IT, WHERE IT COMES FROM, AND HOW WE COULD ALL GET A LITTLE BIT SMARTER ABOUT IT.
POD1000000005_S0000004	BUT IN A FUN WAY. MILLION BAZILLION, HELPING DOLLARS MAKE MORE SENSE. THIS PODCAST IS PRESENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH GREENLIGHT, THE DEBIT CARD FOR KIDS.
POD1000000005_S0000005	LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS.
POD1000000005_S0000006	LIKE SO MANY NEW AMERICANS, DAE JAE KIM CAME TO THIS COUNTRY ON A QUEST.
POD1000000005_S0000007	I HAVE A DREAM TO REALIZE FOR AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000008	AFTER SETTLING IN LOS ANGELES, THE KOREAN BORN KIM DID THE IMMIGRANT HUSTLE.
POD1000000005_S0000009	WORKING ALL KINDS OF JOBS. HE DELIVERED LAUNDRY, SOLD CARS. FINALLY, HE LANDED A GIG WORKING IN THE CITY'S KOREAN AMERICAN APPAREL INDUSTRY, WHICH LOCALS CALL THE JOBBER MARKET.
POD1000000005_S0000010	I HAVE AN UNCLE WHO HAS ONE FABRIC COMPANY IN KOREA.
POD1000000005_S0000011	HE ALWAYS EXPORTED FABRIC TO THE UNITED STATES.
POD1000000005_S0000012	THEN HE RECOMMENDED TO GO TO THE JAVA AREA AND GET A JOB IN FABRIC SALES FORCE.
POD1000000005_S0000013	SO I FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE.
POD1000000005_S0000014	HIS UNCLE'S ADVICE PAID OFF. KIM WORKED FOR A DECADE SELLING FABRIC.
POD1000000005_S0000015	THEN IN 2000, HE AND HIS WIFE STARTED A GARMENT BUSINESS OF THEIR OWN.
POD1000000005_S0000016	THEY CALLED IT TREBIEN.
POD1000000005_S0000017	AND THEY SOLD
POD1000000005_S0000018	FASHION BASIC.
POD1000000005_S0000019	FASHION BASIC.
POD1000000005_S0000020	CAN WEAR ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE.
POD1000000005_S0000021	KIM'S COMPANY SOLD A BUNCH OF WHOLESALE SEPARATES, T SHIRTS, SWEATERS, LITTLE SKIRTS AND SUCH, TO CLOTHING BOUTIQUES.
POD1000000005_S0000022	AND ALL OF IT WAS MADE RIGHT THERE IN LA'S GARMENT DISTRICT, WHERE WE VISITED MR. KIM IN TRAYBIEN'S SHOWROOM.
POD1000000005_S0000023	I ALWAYS SAY TO MY CUSTOMERS, I HAVE A USA BACKGROUND. MADE IN USA IS DADDY'S FRIEND.
POD1000000005_S0000024	IN THE EARLY DAYS OF TRIBUNE, WHEN CAM AND HIS WIFE WERE STILL CHASING THEIR AMERICAN DREAM, THEY GOT AN ORDER FROM A SMALL CLOTHING BOUTIQUE RUN BY ANOTHER KOREAN COUPLE.
POD1000000005_S0000025	IT WAS CALLED FOREVER 21.
POD1000000005_S0000026	KIM HAPPILY SUPPLIED THEM WITH CLOTHES UNTIL ONE DAY...
POD1000000005_S0000027	THEY CUT ME OUT, AND ABOUT 18 YEARS AGO.
POD1000000005_S0000029	THEY CUT YOU OUT.
POD1000000005_S0000030	YEAH.
POD1000000005_S0000031	WHY?
POD1000000005_S0000032	BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS SYSTEM IS NOT MATCHED WITH MINE.
POD1000000005_S0000033	BASICALLY, HERE'S WHAT WENT DOWN. KIM GOT A COMPLAINT FROM THE WAREHOUSE. THE SLEEVES ON ONE OF THE THREE QUARTER TOPS HE SOLD THEM WERE A QUARTER INCH TOO LONG.
POD1000000005_S0000034	KIM WAS NOT DOWN WITH THE CRITIQUE.
POD1000000005_S0000035	I'M NOT TAYLOR. I SAID, I TOLD HIM I'M NOT TAYLOR.
POD1000000005_S0000036	AND YOU CAN GUESS HOW THAT WENT OVER.
POD1000000005_S0000037	HE TOLD ME THAT HE CANNOT DO BUSINESS IF I SAID LIKE THAT.
POD1000000005_S0000038	SO I SAID OKAY LET'S START THE BUSINESS. THAT'S IT.
POD1000000005_S0000040	HAD KIM KNOWN THAT THE COMPANY HE WAS MOUTHING OFF TO WOULD GROW TO BECOME ONE OF THE LARGEST FAST FASHION CLOTHING BRANDS IN THE WORLD, PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE FIXED THAT QUARTER INCH WHOOPSIES.
POD1000000005_S0000041	THAT LITTLE EXTRA BIT OF SLEEVE COST HIM A SLICE OF HIS AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000042	FOR 18 YEARS, I COULD NOT GET ANY ORDER.
POD1000000005_S0000044	AND I REGRET IT.
POD1000000005_S0000046	DID YOU SAY YOU REGRET?
POD1000000005_S0000047	YEAH, I REGRET UNTIL LAST YEAR.
POD1000000005_S0000049	BECAUSE THEIR ORDER WAS HUGE.
POD1000000005_S0000050	A LOT OF FOLKS FROM THE KOREAN JOBBER MARKET MADE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF FOREVER 21.
POD1000000005_S0000051	THE TEEN BRAND'S SYNONYMOUS WITH $3 CAMISOLES, NONSENSICAL GRAPHIC TEES, AND FESTIVAL WEAR FOR PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER MAKE IT TO COACHELLA.
POD1000000005_S0000052	BUT IN THE END, MAYBE IT'S OKAY THAT KIM DIDN'T HITCH HIS WAGON TO THE CLOTHING GIANT.
POD1000000005_S0000053	FOREVER 21'S RISE TO FAST FASHION DOMINANCE WAS DIZZYING.
POD1000000005_S0000054	WITH THE BRAND'S UNBRIDLED EXPANSION, MOM AND POP MANAGEMENT APPROACH, AND WEAK E COMMERCE GAME SET IT UP TO FALL HARD.
POD1000000005_S0000055	DESPITE THOSE $4.99 LEGGINGS.
POD1000000005_S0000056	I'M LAUREN OBER AND FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS SPECTACULAR FAILURES, THE SHOW THAT LOOKS CUTE EVEN THOUGH FAILURE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO JACK OUR STYLE.
POD1000000005_S0000058	THERE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD IN LOS ANGELES ABOUT THREE MILES WEST OF DOWNTOWN THAT IS THE BEATING HEART OF THE CITY'S KOREAN COMMUNITY.
POD1000000005_S0000059	IT'S GOT EVERYTHING KOREAN KARAOKE BARS AND KOREAN BARBECUE JOINTS BOBA TEA SHOPS AND BANKS
POD1000000005_S0000060	THERE'S ALSO LIKE BEAUTY TREATMENT, BEAUTY MAKEUP, THE SPAS.
POD1000000005_S0000062	I MEAN, YOU DO HAVE AMAZING SKIN.
POD1000000005_S0000064	SO.
POD1000000005_S0000065	I ACCEPT, I'M NOT SURE IF I...
POD1000000005_S0000066	I CAME TO GET A TOUR OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM HEYPIN M.
POD1000000005_S0000067	SHE'S A LEADER IN THE KOREAN COMMUNITY HERE.
POD1000000005_S0000068	SHE RUNS FAITH AND COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT, WHICH IS A LOCAL NONPROFIT.
POD1000000005_S0000069	COME THIS WAY.
POD1000000005_S0000071	THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS BY KOREANS FOR KOREANS.
POD1000000005_S0000072	THOUGH A HEFTY NUMBER OF NON KOREANS COME FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED SPAS AND THE K POP SHOPS AND THE MOUTH NUMBING KIMCHI.
POD1000000005_S0000073	SO IT'S REALLY FOR US, IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE POLITICAL SOCIAL HEADQUARTER OR CENTER FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
POD1000000005_S0000074	AND ALSO, CRETETOWN, LA, IN ESSENCE, IS THE HEADQUARTER FOR KOREAN AMERICA USA.
POD1000000005_S0000075	LOS ANGELES HAS THE LARGEST KOREAN COMMUNITY OF ANY CITY IN THE U.S.
POD1000000005_S0000076	BUT BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS, IM SAYS HER COMMUNITY HAS OFTEN FELT ISOLATED.
POD1000000005_S0000077	THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGH IS A HOME BASE.
POD1000000005_S0000078	BUT IN ESSENCE, AS A KOREAN AMERICAN, KNOWING THERE'S KOREATOWN AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET BECAUSE THIS SPACE ALLOWS OUR COMMUNITIES TO COME TOGETHER AND TO BE VISIBLE, I DON'T FEEL ALONE.
POD1000000005_S0000079	I WANTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PLACE, WITH ITS TIGHT KNIT KOREAN CHURCHES AND ITS EVER YOUTHFUL K BEAUTY BOUTIQUES, BIRTHED ONE OF THE LARGEST FAST FASHION BRANDS IN THE WORLD.
POD1000000005_S0000081	AFTER THE U.S. AND KOREA ESTABLISHED OFFICIAL DIPLOMATIC TIES IN 1882, THE FIRST WAVE OF KOREAN IMMIGRATION BEGAN TO ROLL IN.
POD1000000005_S0000082	FIRST TO HAWAII, THEN TO LOS ANGELES.
POD1000000005_S0000083	IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A SECOND SURGE AFTER THE KOREAN WAR.
POD1000000005_S0000084	THE WATTS RIOTS OF 1965 PUSHED A LOT OF KOREANS TO THE LA SUBURBS.
POD1000000005_S0000085	BUT THE NUMBER OF NEW ARRIVALS TO THE CITY FROM SOUTH KOREA CONTINUED TO GROW THANKS TO A LOOSENING OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.
POD1000000005_S0000086	BY THE TIME M ARRIVED IN THE U.S. IN 1974, THE COMMUNITY WAS ALREADY ON THE WAY UP.
POD1000000005_S0000087	THANKS TO SOME HUSTLING BY A FEW LOCAL KOREAN BUSINESSMEN, KOREATOWN GOT ITS OWN OFFICIAL BLUE NEIGHBORHOOD SIGNS IN 1980.
POD1000000005_S0000088	SO THERE WAS KIND OF THAT SIGNAGE.
POD1000000005_S0000089	ALTHOUGH ALREADY THERE WAS THE CHURCH AND THE GROCERY STORES, YOU KNOW, STARTED TO ANCHOR THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY, RIGHT? AND THE RESTAURANT.
POD1000000005_S0000090	JUST AFTER KOREATOWN BECAME LEGIT, A COUPLE NAMED DOHWAN AND JINSUK CHANG EMIGRATED FROM SEOUL.
POD1000000005_S0000091	THEY CAME IN SEARCH OF THE SAME THING OUR PAL DJ KIM WAS AFTER, THE AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000092	IN SOUTH KOREA, MR. CHANG RAN A COFFEE AND JUICE DELIVERY BUSINESS.
POD1000000005_S0000093	MRS. CHANG WAS A HAIRDRESSER. WHEN THEY MOVED TO L.A., THEY TOOK A SERIES OF MENIAL JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET.
POD1000000005_S0000094	MR. CHANG HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WORKED AS A GAS STATION ATTENDANT AND
POD1000000005_S0000095	HE DID JANITORIAL WORK.
POD1000000005_S0000096	THAT'S SAPNA MAHESHWARI. SHE'S A BUSINESS REPORTER AT THE NEW YORK TIMES.
POD1000000005_S0000097	THE LEGEND HAS IT THAT HE WAS WORKING AT A GAS STATION AND AS HE SAW PEOPLE WITH THESE REALLY NICE CARS, HE WOULD ALWAYS ASK THEM WHAT THEY DID.
POD1000000005_S0000098	AND HE NOTICED THE PEOPLE WITH THE NICEST CARS WORKED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY.
POD1000000005_S0000099	OKAY, NOW I WOULD THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WITH THE NICEST CARS IN LA WERE LIKE JACK NICHOLSON AND MEL GIBSON, BUT WHAT DO I KNOW?
POD1000000005_S0000100	FOR SOME REASON, THE GARMENT TRADE JUST BECAME FIXED IN MR. CHANG'S MIND. SO HE AND HIS WIFE WENT FOR IT.
POD1000000005_S0000101	THE TWO OF THEM PUT TOGETHER THEIR SAVINGS AND THEY DECIDED TO OPEN A STORE THAT WAS FIRST CALLED FASHION 21.
POD1000000005_S0000102	AND THEY FIGURED OUT WITH THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING IN LOS ANGELES HOW TO DELIVER FASHIONS THAT PEOPLE WANTED AND TO COME UP WITH A WAY OF SELLING CLOTHES THAT CHURN THROUGH STYLES, MADE AN EXCITING ENVIRONMENT.
POD1000000005_S0000103	AND REALLY CREATED THE TYPE OF PLACE WHERE YOU HAD TO COME IN TO SEE WHAT WAS NEW.
POD1000000005_S0000104	NOW, THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM VERY REVOLUTIONARY.
POD1000000005_S0000105	ESPECIALLY TODAY WHEN CONSUMERS CAN GET KNOCKOFFS OF THE LATEST LUXURY FASHIONS SEEMINGLY BEFORE THE MODELS HAVE STRUTTED OFF THE CATWALK.
POD1000000005_S0000106	BUT IN THE 80S, THAT WASN'T REALLY HOW FASHION WAS DONE.
POD1000000005_S0000107	THEY HIT ON SOMETHING, AS HAPPENS IN RETAIL, THEY HIT UPON A FORMULA THAT RESONATED WITH SHOPPERS AND THEY QUICKLY BECAME A SUCCESS.
POD1000000005_S0000108	IN 1984, THE CHANGS OPENED FASHION 21, A 900 SQUARE FOOT BOUTIQUE IN THE HEART OF THE HIGHLAND PARK NEIGHBORHOOD.
POD1000000005_S0000109	THEY PACKED IT WITH CHEAP, SKIMPY TEEN CLOTHES THAT THEY BOUGHT FROM LA'S KOREAN AMERICAN GARMENT MANUFACTURERS, LIKE THE KIND MR. KIM SOLD.
POD1000000005_S0000110	I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DEFINITELY HELPED THEM WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE IN LOS ANGELES AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER KOREAN AMERICAN GARMENT MANUFACTURERS IN THAT CITY SPECIFICALLY.
POD1000000005_S0000111	SO I THINK THAT VERY MUCH WAS A PROPELLER OF THEIR SUCCESS.
POD1000000005_S0000112	REMEMBER THE JOBBER MARKET?
POD1000000005_S0000113	JAVA J O B B E R JAVA MARKET
POD1000000005_S0000114	KIM EXPLAINS THAT THE JOBBER MARKET CAME ABOUT AROUND 35 YEARS AGO WITH THE ARRIVAL OF KOREAN IMMIGRANTS FROM SOUTH AMERICA.
POD1000000005_S0000115	HE CAME FROM BOLIVIA. MANY OF THE OTHER FOLKS HAD WORKED IN BRAZIL IN THAT COUNTRY'S MASSIVE GARMENT INDUSTRY. AND THEY ALL BROUGHT THAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM TO L.A.
POD1000000005_S0000116	THEY BOUGHT WHOLESALE CLOTHES OUT GARMENTS AND WENT TO WORK OPENING THEIR OWN STORES.
POD1000000005_S0000117	PEOPLE STARTED TO SELL DEAD MERCHANDISE.
POD1000000005_S0000118	BUT THE PEOPLE COME FROM BRAZIL, THEY STARTED MANUFACTURING THEIR OWN BRAND OF PEARLS.
POD1000000005_S0000119	BY THE TIME THE CHANGS GOT TO LA, THE KOREAN AMERICAN APPAREL INDUSTRY WAS ALREADY IN FULL SWING.
POD1000000005_S0000120	THE COUPLE WORKED WITH MANUFACTURERS IN THE JABRA MARKET TO FILL UP FASHION 21 WITH INEXPENSIVE STYLES THAT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY.
POD1000000005_S0000122	MY PRODUCER WHITNEY AND I DECIDED TO SEE WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.
POD1000000005_S0000123	SO WE TOOK A TRIP TO 5637 NORTH FIGUEROA STREET AND CRUISED AROUND THE SHOP FOR A BIT.
POD1000000005_S0000125	THE SIGN ON THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING STILL READS FASHION 21, AN HOMAGE TO ITS HUMBLE ROOTS.
POD1000000005_S0000126	BUT IT'S A FOREVER 21 STORE THROUGH AND THROUGH.
POD1000000005_S0000127	SEE STYLES FROM $1.00. BODY SUITS.
POD1000000005_S0000129	YOU CAN BUY A SUIT IN THERE FOR EIGHT BUCKS IF YOU WANT.
POD1000000005_S0000130	I'VE GOT ALL THE BODY SUITS I NEED RIGHT NOW.
POD1000000005_S0000131	WELL, THAT'S DEBATABLE.
POD1000000005_S0000132	WE POP INSIDE AND IT LOOKS PRETTY CLASSY.
POD1000000005_S0000133	LIKE MAYBE IT'S MORE FOR ADULTS THAN TEENS.
POD1000000005_S0000134	WE HEAD TO A RACK OF GRAPHIC TEES AND I'M KIND OF INTO THEM.
POD1000000005_S0000135	I MEAN, I WOULD 100% WEAR THAT ACTUALLY.
POD1000000005_S0000137	BAD SHOE?
POD1000000005_S0000138	IF THEY HAD THAT IN LIKE A LARGE, I WOULD TOTALLY WEAR THAT.
POD1000000005_S0000139	CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP.
POD1000000005_S0000140	WELL, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU CAN'T STEP ON STUFF.
POD1000000005_S0000141	ALAS, WE LEFT EMPTY HANDED. NO $8 BODYSUITS FOR WHITNEY.
POD1000000005_S0000143	IF THE FASHION 21 STORE ON FIGUEROA WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT THE CHANGS' BUSINESS WAS IN THE EARLY DAYS, IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE LITTLE LIFE FOR THEM.
POD1000000005_S0000144	IN ITS FIRST YEAR, THE STORE PULLED IN $700,000.
POD1000000005_S0000145	AND THAT WAS LARGELY THANKS TO OTHER KOREAN IMMIGRANTS.
POD1000000005_S0000146	BUT THEN THEY REALIZED HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS BUSINESS MODEL WAS.
POD1000000005_S0000147	AND THEY STARTED OPENING NEW STORES.
POD1000000005_S0000148	THAT'S LUDOVICA CESARIO. SHE'S A MARKETING PROFESSOR AT LEHIGH UNIVERSITY.
POD1000000005_S0000149	THEY THEN CHANGED THE NAME TO FOREVER 21 WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE SELLING CLOTHES FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE TRENDY OR FRESH OR JUST YOUNG MORE GENERALLY.
POD1000000005_S0000150	THIS BUSINESS MODEL, SELLING CHEAP, TRENDY CLOTHES THAT COULD BE MANUFACTURED QUICKLY AND TURNED OVER FREQUENTLY SO THE STORES ALWAYS FELT NEW AND FRESH, THAT WAS THE CHANG'S SECRET WEAPON.
POD1000000005_S0000151	TODAY, WE CALL THIS APPROACH FAST FASHION, AND LOTS OF GLOBAL BRANDS DO IT. H&M, ZARA, AND ASOS, TO NAME A FEW.
POD1000000005_S0000152	BUT FOREVER 21 PERFECTED IT.
POD1000000005_S0000153	FOR A DEFINITION OF FAST FASHION, HERE'S THE WASHINGTON POST FASHION CRITIC, I'M SORRY, THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING FASHION CRITIC, ROBIN GAVON.
POD1000000005_S0000154	I MEAN, IT'S GENERALLY CLOTHING THAT IS PRODUCED VERY QUICKLY, VERY MUCH LEAPING ONTO A TREND OF THE MOMENT, AND NOT MEANT TO LAST.
POD1000000005_S0000155	MEANING THE DESIGN IS NOT MEANT TO LAST OR THE CLOTHING IS NOT MEANT TO LAST.
POD1000000005_S0000156	BOTH. THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN A TREND, IN A FAD, AND ONE THAT IS MOST LIKELY A FLEETING FAD, FAST FASHION ALLOWS YOU TO GLOM ONTO THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
POD1000000005_S0000157	IT ALLOWS YOU TO GRASP IT FOR MINIMAL COST.
POD1000000005_S0000158	WEAR IT A FEW TIMES.
POD1000000005_S0000159	SAVOR THE MOMENT, LITERALLY THE MOMENT, AND THEN MOVE ON.
POD1000000005_S0000160	AND FAST FASHION TRADES IN FOMO, SAYS CESARIO.
POD1000000005_S0000161	THERE'S THIS ALMOST FEAR OF MISSING OUT, THAT IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE STORE AS SOON AS THE SHIPMENT ARRIVES, YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THAT PRODUCT IN YOUR SIZE.
POD1000000005_S0000162	AND SO IT CREATES THIS SENSE OF URGENCY, BASICALLY, IN CONSUMERS TO WANT TO MAKE THEM KEEP COMING BACK TO THE STORE.
POD1000000005_S0000163	THAT AND INSANELY CHEAP PRICES.
POD1000000005_S0000164	LEG CLOTHES FOR UNDER $10 A PIECE.
POD1000000005_S0000165	THIS BUSINESS MODEL PLUS A MANAGEABLE NUMBER OF STORES MEANT THAT THE CHANG'S OPERATION WAS PROFITABLE AND EVERYTHING WAS PRETTY DECENT.
POD1000000005_S0000166	BUT THE CHANGS WEREN'T INTERESTED IN PRETTY DECENT
POD1000000005_S0000167	THEY WERE CHASING THEIR BIG, BOLD AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000168	I THINK THAT MR. CHANG, AT LEAST IN THIS PERIOD WHERE HE STARTED EXPANDING INTO DEPARTMENT STORES,
POD1000000005_S0000169	ALSO THOUGHT THAT FOREVER 21 COULD BE MORE THAN WHERE COLLEGE GIRLS GOT A NEW OUTFIT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.
POD1000000005_S0000170	HE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THEY COULD BE A PLACE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY COULD BE OUTFITTED WITH
POD1000000005_S0000171	WHERE YOU WOULD REALLY TRUST THIS STORE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A LOT OF THE CLOTHING FOR YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE.
POD1000000005_S0000173	TWELVE MILES FROM THE FIRST FOREVER 21 PROPERTY IS THE BEVERLY CENTER, A SPRAWLING SHOPPING MALL THAT ONE ANGELENO TOLD ME IS, QUOTE, ONE OF THE MOST HATED MALLS IN LA.
POD1000000005_S0000174	IT'S MORE THAN 800,000 SQUARE FEET OF PRADA, FENDI AND BALENCIAGA.
POD1000000005_S0000175	TUCKED INTO A CORNER ON LEVEL 8 IS XXI FOREVER, WHICH I GUESS IS FOREVER 21, BUT MAKE IT LUXURY.
POD1000000005_S0000176	THE STORE OCCUPIES MORE THAN AN ACRE OF REAL ESTATE AND IS NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE OVER A CERTAIN AGE.
POD1000000005_S0000177	IT'S BRIGHT AND LOUD AND THE SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING SELECTION OF CLOTHES IS DISORIENTING.
POD1000000005_S0000178	HONESTLY, I FELT LIKE I NEEDED A XANAX AND A NAP AFTER WE VISITED.
POD1000000005_S0000179	BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE CHANGS WERE AFTER. THEY WERE PLANTING THEIR FLAG WITH HUGE STORES AND FANCY MALLS.
POD1000000005_S0000180	THIS WAS THEIR AMERICAN DREAM REALIZED.
POD1000000005_S0000181	AND THEY BUILT IT LARGELY ON TOP OF THE ASHES OF FALLEN RETAILERS.
POD1000000005_S0000182	IT WAS REALLY IN THE EARLY 2000S THAT YOU SAW THEM SORT OF BURST ONTO THE NATIONAL SCENE AND THAT REALLY EMERGED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF STORES OWNED BY GADZOOKS.
POD1000000005_S0000183	DO YOU REMEMBER THAT RETAILER?
POD1000000005_S0000184	GADZOOKS WAS A TEEN CLOTHING COMPANY WITH HUNDREDS OF STORES AND MALLS ACROSS THE U.S.
POD1000000005_S0000185	IN 2004, IT FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.
POD1000000005_S0000186	AND SO THERE'S ALL THESE STORES AND OTHER ASSETS THAT WERE UP FOR PURCHASE AND FOREVER 21 BID ON THOSE SUCCESSFULLY.
POD1000000005_S0000187	AND WITH THAT, THEY REALLY EXPANDED THEIR STORE BASE AND ALSO BECAME A NATIONAL PLAYER IN A WHOLE NEW WAY.
POD1000000005_S0000188	IN 2005, FOREVER 21 BEGAN A PERIOD OF MIND BLOWING EXPANSION.
POD1000000005_S0000189	WHEN MALL CHAINS LIKE MERVYN'S AND SEARS AND OTHERS WERE TOPPLING UNDER THEIR OWN WEIGHT, FOREVER 21 WAS SNATCHING UP THEIR SCRAPS.
POD1000000005_S0000190	WHEN THE GLOBAL RECESSION HIT IN 2008, CHANG'S LOOKED AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH EVEN HARDER.
POD1000000005_S0000191	NOTHING LIKE HITTING THE GAS WHEN YOUR COMPETITORS ARE SLAMMING INTO THE GUARDRAILS.
POD1000000005_S0000192	BY 2011, FOREVER 21 HAD ALMOST 500 STORES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND EMPLOYED 35,000 PEOPLE.
POD1000000005_S0000193	WITHIN JUST A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT, THE COMPANY HAD EXPANDED TO 47 COUNTRIES.
POD1000000005_S0000194	SO THAT MEANT THAT TWEENS IN THE PHILIPPINES OR ROMANIA OR MACAU COULD ALL ROCK A BOXY SHIRRED FLOUNCE CUFF TOP OR LEOPARD DRAWSTRING LOUNGE SHORTS FOR LESS THAN THE PRICE OF A MOVIE TICKET.
POD1000000005_S0000195	2015 WAS FOREVER 21'S PEAK.
POD1000000005_S0000196	IT DID $4.4 BILLION IN SALES THAT YEAR.
POD1000000005_S0000197	WHICH MEANS THAT THEY SOLD A HELL OF A LOT OF $10 MINI DRESSES AND BRALETTES AND WHATEVER DOLPHIN SHORTS ARE.
POD1000000005_S0000198	BUT EVEN THOUGH FOREVER 21 HAD GROWN INTO A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS, THE CHANGS RAN IT LIKE A MOM AND POP OPERATION.
POD1000000005_S0000199	THEY OWNED 99% OF THE COMPANY AND HAD NEVER TAKEN ON INVESTORS, WHICH MEANT THAT THERE WAS, AND I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, NO REAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEY HAD TO RUN DECISIONS BY.
POD1000000005_S0000200	OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.
POD1000000005_S0000201	THE BOARD CONSISTED OF MR. CHANG, ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS, AND ANOTHER FOREVER 21 EXECUTIVE.
POD1000000005_S0000202	THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE BUILDING SOMETHING OF AN EMPIRE. THEY WERE IN CHARGE, MR. AND MRS. CHANG WERE IN CHARGE, AND THEY WERE GOING TO PASS THIS BUSINESS ON TO THEIR DAUGHTERS.
POD1000000005_S0000203	AND IT WAS ONLY GOING TO GROW AND BECOME BIGGER.
POD1000000005_S0000204	THE FACT THAT THEY OWNED EVERYTHING ALSO MEANT THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY.
POD1000000005_S0000205	AND THE FAMILY'S NOT REAL INTO TALKING TO THE PRESS.
POD1000000005_S0000206	THEY 100% WOULDN'T TALK TO US FOR THE STORY, THOUGH WE DID REACH OUT.
POD1000000005_S0000207	WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MR. CHANG OVERSAW BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY, WHILE MRS. CHANG RAN THE MERCHANDISING SIDE OF THINGS ONE FLOOR BELOW. THEIR ADULT DAUGHTERS, LINDA AND ESTHER, SERVED AS THEIR DEPUTIES.
POD1000000005_S0000208	THEY KIND OF OVERSAW THEIR OWN FIEFDOMS WITHIN THE FOREVER 21 BUSINESS.
POD1000000005_S0000209	MR. CHANG HAD TO REVIEW EVERY SINGLE REAL ESTATE CONTRACT AND WAS INVOLVED WITH THE OPENING OF EVERY NEW STORE, WHICH AT THE PACE THAT THEY WERE EXPANDING IS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.
POD1000000005_S0000210	MRS. CHANG HAD HER OWN HANDS FULL.
POD1000000005_S0000211	OVERSEEING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STYLES AND GARMENTS AND APPROVING EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE THEY APPEARED IN STORES.
POD1000000005_S0000212	I MEAN, IN MANY WAYS IT'S FLABBERGASTING THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE COULD HAVE TAKEN ON THIS AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY, ESPECIALLY AT A COMPANY OF THIS SIZE.
POD1000000005_S0000213	ONE MINUTE THEY'D BE OVERSEEING NEW REAL ESTATE PURCHASES OR CLOTHING DESIGNS, AND THE NEXT MINUTE THEY'D BE APPROVING EXPENSES FOR BUSINESS LUNCHES OR UBERS.
POD1000000005_S0000214	WHICH SEEMS LIKE THE VERY DEFINITION OF MICROMANAGING.
POD1000000005_S0000215	NO BILLIONAIRE CEOS ARE APPROVING TIMESHEETS OR EVEN WHAT BUTTONS OR ZIPPERS SHOULD BE USED ON NEW DESIGNS.
POD1000000005_S0000216	KEVIN FAGANS WAS FOREVER 21'S GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR DURING THE TIME OF THE BRAND'S RAPID INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION.
POD1000000005_S0000217	HE SAYS WHILE HAVING YOUR HAND IN EVERY POT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS, IT DID MEAN THAT THE CHANGS KNEW WHAT THEIR BRAND WAS ALL ABOUT.
POD1000000005_S0000218	WELL, I THINK THE ONE THING THEY UNDERSTOOD WAS BRAND PERSONALITY.
POD1000000005_S0000219	SO THEY KNEW THEIR CUSTOMER INCREDIBLY WELL.
POD1000000005_S0000220	YOU KNOW KNOWING AND AT LEAST I SAY THAT DOMESTICALLY I MEAN IN THE US THEY KNEW WHO SHE WAS
POD1000000005_S0000221	THEY KNEW WHAT SHE LIKED.
POD1000000005_S0000222	THEY KNEW WHEN SHE WANTED THINGS.
POD1000000005_S0000223	SO IT'S LIKE BACK TO SCHOOL, IT'S CHRISTMAS.
POD1000000005_S0000224	IT'S OUR HOLIDAY, IT'S FESTIVAL SEASON, WHICH IS HUGE, OBVIOUSLY.
POD1000000005_S0000225	WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND PRODUCT AND WHO'S BUYING IT, IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE MARKET YOU'RE OPERATING IN.
POD1000000005_S0000226	I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH RUNNING AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS IS THAT SEASONALITY HAS CHANGED.
POD1000000005_S0000227	CULTURAL MINDSETS CHANGE.
POD1000000005_S0000228	SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE FRENCH CUSTOMER WANTS, THE GERMAN CUSTOMER DOESN'T.
POD1000000005_S0000229	YOU KNOW WHAT SOMEONE IN AUSTRALIA IS WEIGHING WELL FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE COUNTER SEASONAL
POD1000000005_S0000230	SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S WHEN YOU'RE SHIPPING THAT PRODUCT, YOU CAN'T SHIP THEM COATS IN JANUARY, RIGHT?
POD1000000005_S0000231	IN FOREVER 21'S RACE TO GLOBAL DOMINATION, THEY SPREAD THEMSELVES TOO THIN.
POD1000000005_S0000232	WITH NEARLY 800 STORES WORLDWIDE, THEY COULDN'T REALLY MANAGE ALL THOSE PHYSICAL SPACES.
POD1000000005_S0000233	NOW, IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RETAIL TRENDS, YOU'LL KNOW THIS. MANAGING MILLIONS OF SQUARE FEET OF RETAIL SPACE IS A MEGA CHALLENGE IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET.
POD1000000005_S0000234	SHOPPERS ARE INCREASINGLY BUYING ONLINE AND HAVING STUFF DELIVERED.
POD1000000005_S0000235	OR THEY'RE USING YOUR STORE SIMPLY AS A PICKUP LOCATION.
POD1000000005_S0000236	THE DAYS OF TEENS BOPPING AROUND A MALL FOR THE AFTERNOON IN SEARCH OF THE HOTTEST NEW LOOKS ARE OVER.
POD1000000005_S0000237	WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
POD1000000005_S0000238	WHEN WE COME BACK HOW A BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS GOES BANKRUPT OVERNIGHT.
POD1000000005_S0000239	PLUS, I BOP AROUND A REAL LIFE MALL FOR THE AFTERNOON WITH A REAL LIFE TEEN. FUN!

POD1000000005_S0000277	IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST FAST FASHION BRANDS FELL APART, I DECIDED TO GO TO THE SOURCE, A TEEN GIRL.
POD1000000005_S0000278	EDEN GOLDBLOOM IS A 16 YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR WHO LIVES JUST OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON, D.C.
POD1000000005_S0000279	SHE USED TO SHOP AT FOREVER 21 A LOT. SHE SAID UNTIL THEY QUOTE STOPPED BEING CUTE
POD1000000005_S0000280	THEY'RE CHEAP. THEY'RE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE. THEY BREAK FAST AND SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY TACKY
POD1000000005_S0000281	WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO MONTGOMERY MALL RIGHT OUTSIDE OF DC.
POD1000000005_S0000282	EXPLAIN EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME EXPLAIN
POD1000000005_S0000283	AND THEN YOU'LL SEE LIKE A NORMAL SHIRT AND THEN YOU'LL TURN IT AROUND AND IT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE WEIRD ON IT.
POD1000000005_S0000285	AND IT'S SURREAL TO SUPPORT THEM.
POD1000000005_S0000286	BEFORE I GO INTO THE THIRD FOREVER 21 OF THIS STORY, I ISSUED A CHALLENGE.
POD1000000005_S0000287	EACH OF US HAD TO FIND ONE CUTE THING TO BUY.
POD1000000005_S0000288	BUT AFTER MANY MINUTES OF BROWSING THE ENORMOUS STORE...
POD1000000005_S0000289	I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THE CHALLENGE.
POD1000000005_S0000290	I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THE CHALLENGE EITHER.
POD1000000005_S0000291	BECAUSE IT'S OVERWHELMING ACTUALLY.
POD1000000005_S0000292	OKAY
POD1000000005_S0000293	NOW, IT MAKES SENSE THAT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING CUTE FOR ME.
POD1000000005_S0000294	I MEAN, THE STORE ISN'T CALLED FOREVER 41.
POD1000000005_S0000295	BUT IT SHOULD TROUBLE THE COMPANY THAT A MEMBER OF ITS TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC CAN'T FIND ANYTHING SHE LIKES IN A STORE THE SIZE OF A MCMANSION.
POD1000000005_S0000296	OKAY, SOME BASIC...
POD1000000005_S0000298	IT'S LIKE A NORMAL MATERIAL.
POD1000000005_S0000299	YEAH.
POD1000000005_S0000300	FINALLY, AFTER SOME SERIOUS HUNTING, EDEN LANDED ON THE ONE THING IN THE ENTIRE STORE SHE WOULD WEAR.
POD1000000005_S0000301	ALRIGHT
POD1000000005_S0000302	YOU CAN HOLD ON TO THAT.
POD1000000005_S0000303	ALRIGHT.
POD1000000005_S0000304	THEN IT WAS UP TO ME TO FIND SOMETHING I LIKED.
POD1000000005_S0000305	I TRIED ON A CROP WINDBREAKER AND THAT WENT ABOUT AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED.
POD1000000005_S0000306	IT'S VERY SNUG AROUND HERE. IS IT SUPPOSED TO FIT LIKE THIS?
POD1000000005_S0000308	HEY GUYS, I'M JUST GONNA GO OUT FOR A JOG AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO THE CLUB AFTERWARDS.
POD1000000005_S0000309	FINALLY, I LANDED ON MY ITEM, A PLAIN BLACK BASEBALL CAP WITH THE WORDS, DANGEROUS BUT FUN WRITTEN ON THE CROWN.
POD1000000005_S0000310	DANGEROUS BUT FUN.
POD1000000005_S0000311	DANGEROUS BUT FUN.
POD1000000005_S0000312	I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THAT.
POD1000000005_S0000313	DO YOU THINK I SHOULD?
POD1000000005_S0000314	I THINK YOU SHOULD.
POD1000000005_S0000315	DO YOU THINK?
POD1000000005_S0000316	NOW I CAN TELL YOU THAT I LOOKED NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR FUN.
POD1000000005_S0000317	BUT I BOUGHT THE HAT AND EDEN BOUGHT THE LITTLE SKIRT AND WE BOTH FULFILLED OUR FOREVER 21 CHALLENGE.
POD1000000005_S0000318	GREAT JOB US.
POD1000000005_S0000319	ARE WE DONE, THOUGH?
POD1000000005_S0000320	ARE WE DONE, ZEL?
POD1000000005_S0000321	DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE DONE, ZARA?
POD1000000005_S0000322	I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DONE, SO.
POD1000000005_S0000323	WE WERE DONEZO.
POD1000000005_S0000324	I LEFT FOREVER 21 $15.50 LIGHTER AND PERHAPS MORE CONFUSED THAN I HAD BEEN BEFORE ABOUT HOW THE BRAND'S BUSINESS MODEL COULD POSSIBLY MAKE SENSE.
POD1000000005_S0000325	THERE WERE HARDLY ANY SHOPPERS IN ANY OF THE STORES I WENT TO, AND THOSE WHO WERE THERE SEEMED MORE LIKE OLD MILLENNIALS THAN GEN Z TASTEMAKERS.
POD1000000005_S0000326	I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS GIANT STORE WAS ALL ABOUT.
POD1000000005_S0000327	OR HOW FAST FASHION IS EVEN SUPPOSED TO WORK.
POD1000000005_S0000328	I FIGURED ROBIN GAVON COULD HELP.
POD1000000005_S0000329	IN ADDITION TO REPORTING ON THE RUNWAYS OF PARIS AND NEW YORK, GIVHAN OFTEN WRITES ABOUT WHAT FASHION SAYS ABOUT HOW WE LIVE NOW.
POD1000000005_S0000330	AND SHE THINKS A LOT ABOUT FAST FASHION AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR CULTURE, AESTHETICALLY, SOCIALLY, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY.
POD1000000005_S0000331	SURPRISINGLY, SHE ISN'T TOTALLY DOWN ON FAST FASHION.
POD1000000005_S0000332	I DO THINK THAT FAST FASHION HAS KIND OF ALLOWED EVERYONE TO HAVE ACCESS TO AESTHETICALLY THOUGHTFUL CLOTHING.
POD1000000005_S0000333	DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE ALL DRESSING BETTER THOUGH.
POD1000000005_S0000334	NOTICE I SAID TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT.
POD1000000005_S0000336	IN A WAY, GAVON SAYS, FAST FASHION IS KIND OF BRILLIANT WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT.
POD1000000005_S0000337	FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO THE DESIGNER BOUTIQUE.
POD1000000005_S0000338	THEY'RE GOING INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE OR A MASS MERCHANT.
POD1000000005_S0000339	AND, YOU KNOW, THOSE STORES LOOK AT TREND REPORTS AND THEY LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE RUNWAY AND PART OF THEIR GREAT SKILL IN BOTH MARKETING AND MANUFACTURING IS BEING ABLE TO TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND TURN THEM AROUND AT JUST A RAPID FIRE PACE AND GET THEM INTO STORES.
POD1000000005_S0000340	AND THERE ISN'T JUST ONE DELIVERY THAT HAPPENS AT THE BEGINNING OF A SEASON. NO, NO.
POD1000000005_S0000341	IT'S A CONSTANT STREAM OF NEWNESS.
POD1000000005_S0000342	AND WHEN I SAY CONSTANT, I MEAN LIKE EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR SOME OF THESE PLACES.
POD1000000005_S0000343	SO, GAVON SAYS THAT, AT ITS BEST, FAST FASHION MEANS THAT NEW STYLISH CLOTHES AREN'T JUST FOR FANCIES WITH THE CASH TO SHOP HAUTE COUTURE.
POD1000000005_S0000344	BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET.
POD1000000005_S0000345	IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR CLOTHING DESIGNERS TO GO FROM ORIGINAL IDEA TO BRAND SPANKING NEW PRODUCT ON THE RACK IN TWO WEEKS.
POD1000000005_S0000346	ESPECIALLY NOT AT THE VOLUME THAT FOREVER 21 NEEDED TO FILL ALL OF THEIR BAZILLION STORES.
POD1000000005_S0000347	SO THE COMPANY HAD TO FIND SOME SHORTCUTS.
POD1000000005_S0000348	COPYING OTHER DESIGNERS' IDEAS WAS PART OF FOREVER 21'S BUSINESS MODEL FROM THE BEGINNING.
POD1000000005_S0000349	SUSAN SCAFIDI IS THE FOUNDER OF THE FASHION LAW INSTITUTE AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY, AND SHE BASICALLY INVENTED THE FIELD OF FASHION LAW.
POD1000000005_S0000350	AND SHE'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THAT WHILE FOREVER 21'S PRACTICE OF COPYING OTHER DESIGNERS' IDEAS ISN'T A CUTE LOOK, IT'S GENERALLY TOTALLY LEGAL.
POD1000000005_S0000351	FASHION IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS AN ART FORM IN THE UNITED STATES.
POD1000000005_S0000352	SO IT DOESN'T GET COPYRIGHT PROTECTION, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, THE COPYRIGHT OFFICE DECIDED THAT FASHION, NO MATTER HOW FANCIFUL, WAS UTILITARIAN.
POD1000000005_S0000353	ONLY A COUPLE AREAS OF FASHION ARE PROTECTED FROM COPYING.
POD1000000005_S0000354	WE HAVE A TINY BIT OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION, AT LEAST SINCE THE 1960S, FOR TWO DIMENSIONAL ELEMENTS OF FASHION, THINGS LIKE FABRIC PRINTS OR LACE DESIGNS.
POD1000000005_S0000355	OVER ON THE PATENT SIDE, WE'VE HAD HISTORICALLY A LITTLE BIT OF PROTECTION FOR SOME FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS OF FASHION. THINGS LIKE ZIPPERS AND VELCRO AND KEVLAR AND SPACE SUITS OR HAZMAT SUITS.
POD1000000005_S0000356	AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT FASHION REALLY HAS TO RELY ON IS TRADEMARK PROTECTION.
POD1000000005_S0000357	THAT IS, PROTECTION FOR THE LOGO OR LABEL.
POD1000000005_S0000358	SO BASICALLY THE POLO PONY ON YOUR CHEST OR THE GIANT DOUBLE G ON YOUR BELT BUCKLE, THOSE ARE PROTECTED.
POD1000000005_S0000359	THE DESIGN OF THE SHIRT AND BELT THEMSELVES ARE NOT. ORIGINAL PRINTS ARE GENERALLY ALSO PROTECTED.
POD1000000005_S0000360	WHILE THERE AREN'T A TON OF COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK PROTECTIONS FOR FASHION IN THE US,
POD1000000005_S0000361	FOREVER 21 HAS STILL FOUND ITSELF INVOLVED IN MANY, MANY, MANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWSUITS. SCAFIDI SAYS THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS OFFENDERS IN THE GAME.
POD1000000005_S0000362	GUCCI, PUMA, ADIDAS, ANNA SUI, DIANE VON FURSTENBERG, AND GWEN STEFANI HAVE ALL PURSUED LEGAL ACTION AGAINST FOREVER 21, ALLEGING VARIOUS FORMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.
POD1000000005_S0000363	MANY SMALLER BRANDS HAVE ALSO CLAIMED THEIR PRINTS OR DESIGNS WERE RIPPED OFF BY THE MEGA RETAILER.
POD1000000005_S0000364	BUT MOST DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO AGAINST A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR MAMMOTH.
POD1000000005_S0000365	AND SCAFIDI SAYS FAST FASHION BRANDS LIKE FOREVER 21 BANK ON THAT.
POD1000000005_S0000366	A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COPYING IS BAKED INTO THE BUSINESS MODEL OF EVERY FASHION COMPANY.
POD1000000005_S0000367	THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW LITERALLY THEY'RE COPYING AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE CHANGING IT UP.
POD1000000005_S0000368	IN FOREVER 21'S CASE, THEY'D OFTEN BARELY BOTHER TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE ORIGINAL DESIGN THEY WERE RIPPING OFF.
POD1000000005_S0000369	AND SOME OF THEIR FABRIC PRINTS WERE JUST A STRAIGHT CUT AND COPY JOB.
POD1000000005_S0000370	AND MAYBE ON THE BACK END, YOU GET CAUGHT AND HAVE TO PAY OUT THE OCCASIONAL SETTLEMENT OR PAY SOME LEGAL FEES.
POD1000000005_S0000371	BUT USUALLY THAT'S CHEAPER THAN ACTUALLY HIRING DESIGNERS AND ENGAGING IN INNOVATIVE PRODUCT RESEARCH.
POD1000000005_S0000372	COPYING CLOTHING DESIGNS HASN'T BEEN FOREVER 21'S ONLY QUESTIONABLE MOVE.
POD1000000005_S0000373	IN 2001, A WORKERS ADVOCACY CENTER FILED A LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES WHO SAID THEY WERE MADE TO WORK INSANE HOURS FOR WAY LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE.
POD1000000005_S0000374	IN 2012, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SUED THE RETAILER FOR FAILING TO PAY FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO ITS MANUFACTURERS AND CONTRACTORS.
POD1000000005_S0000375	AND IN 2019, POP STAR ARIANA GRANDE SLAPPED FOREVER 21 WITH A $10 MILLION LAWSUIT.
POD1000000005_S0000376	THE COMPANY USED A MODEL IN THIS AD CAMPAIGN THAT LOOKED AN AWFUL LOT LIKE ARIANA GRANDE.
POD1000000005_S0000377	SHE CLAIMS THEY DID THIS TO CONFUSE CONSUMERS THAT SHE HAD ENDORSED THEM.
POD1000000005_S0000378	AND THAT ARIANA GRANDE LOOK ALIKE WAS ME. JUST KIDDING.
POD1000000005_S0000379	A BEHEMOTH LIKE FOREVER 21 RARELY FAILS BECAUSE OF ONE MISSTEP.
POD1000000005_S0000380	HOW DID IT FALTER? LET US COUNT THE WAYS.
POD1000000005_S0000381	HOW ABOUT ROUTINE LEGAL TROUBLES? LEASING TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE RETAIL SPACE, SCREWY MERCHANDISING THAT GUMMED UP THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN, AND NO TRADITIONAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO PUMP THE BRAKES.
POD1000000005_S0000382	AND WITH RETAIL MOVING MORE AND MORE ONLINE, FOREVER 21'S WEAK E COMMERCE GAME DIDN'T HELP MATTERS.
POD1000000005_S0000383	IN RECENT YEARS, THERE'S BEEN ONE OTHER MAJOR ISSUE TUGGING AT FOREVER 21'S FALLACY HEM. SUSTAINABILITY. BECAUSE SUSTAINABLE IT AIN'T.
POD1000000005_S0000384	I WONDER IS FAST FASHION, IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY, LIKE IS THAT JUST AS BAD AS IT CAN GET?
POD1000000005_S0000385	WELL, I'M HESITANT TO SAY THE WORST, BUT I WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO THINK OF ANOTHER REALM OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT IS AS BAD.
POD1000000005_S0000386	BECAUSE FAST FASHION HAS AS ITS FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE
POD1000000005_S0000387	QUICK DISPOSABILITY.
POD1000000005_S0000388	YOU KNOW THE $25 HANDBAG THAT IS A KNOCKOFF OF SOME YOU KNOW ITEM THAT CAME DOWN THE RUNWAY.
POD1000000005_S0000389	THAT IS REALLY MEANT TO BE USED FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN CHUCKED INTO THE TRASH, WELL, THAT'S GOING TO END UP IN A LANDFILL.
POD1000000005_S0000390	AS OPPOSED TO, SAY, AN HERMES HANDBAG THAT IS THE PRICE OF A SMALL CAR.
POD1000000005_S0000391	THAT'S NOT GETTING TOSSED OUT.
POD1000000005_S0000392	THAT'S GOING IN A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX AS INSURANCE FOR THE APOCALYPSE.
POD1000000005_S0000393	SUSTAINABILITY IN FASHION ISN'T JUST ABOUT BUYING MORE DURABLE, CLASSIC HANDBAGS.
POD1000000005_S0000394	THE RISE OF ONLINE CONSIGNMENT SHOPPING, AS WELL AS CLOTHING RENTAL STARTUPS LIKE RENT THE RUNWAY, MEANS CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY TRYING TO BUY USED AND OWN LESS STUFF.
POD1000000005_S0000395	A CLOTHING BRAND THAT BANKS ON DISPOSABILITY IS NOT LONG FOR THIS NEW WORLD.
POD1000000005_S0000396	BY SEPTEMBER 2019, IT HAD ALL BECOME JUST TOO MUCH FOR FOREVER 21.
POD1000000005_S0000397	THE COMPANY, BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS FROM A SINGLE STOREFRONT IN LA INTO A $4 BILLION COLOSSUS, FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.
POD1000000005_S0000398	IT'S THE END OF AN ERA.
POD1000000005_S0000399	IF YOU'RE A FAN OF FOREVER 21, YOU MAY HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO A STORE NEAR YOU.
POD1000000005_S0000400	OVER THE WEEKEND, THE RETAILER FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY, ALL THIS IN HOPES OF SALVAGING THE COMPANY'S BRAND.
POD1000000005_S0000401	NATURALLY, THE INTERNET WAS ABUZZ AT THE NEWS.
POD1000000005_S0000402	TONS OF YOUTUBERS RACED OUT TO FOREVER 21 SHOPS TO GET SOME DEALS, DEALS, DEALS. AND NATURALLY, THEY MADE VIDEOS.
POD1000000005_S0000403	LIKE THIS ONE FROM BEAUTY VLOGGER LAUREN GIRALDO.
POD1000000005_S0000404	OKAY, HONESTLY, NOT GONNA LIE, I WAS EXPECTING THINGS TO LOOK DIFFERENT IN THE FIRST ONE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE EVERYTHING MUST GO SIGNS AND STUFF, YOU KNOW,
POD1000000005_S0000405	I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN TELL WHAT I WAS EXPECTING, BUT A LITTLE BIT OF IT SEEMS LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL.
POD1000000005_S0000406	SO I'M LIKE, HELLO? ARE THE HEADLINES? LIKE, DO THEY MEAN IT? I DON'T KNOW. LET'S GO IN AND SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME BANKRUPT DEALS OR NOT.
POD1000000005_S0000407	LET'S JUST GO SEE WHAT THE G IS.
POD1000000005_S0000408	FYI, SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY BUY ANYTHING AT FOREVER 21.
POD1000000005_S0000409	BUT SHE DID PUT TOGETHER SOME LOOKS AND FILMED HERSELF WEARING THEM IN THE DRESSING ROOM. SO, CLOSE ENOUGH.
POD1000000005_S0000410	DEALS ARE GREAT AND ALL.
POD1000000005_S0000411	BUT FOREVER 21'S FORMER GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KEVIN FAGANS SAID THE BANKRUPTCY NEWS FELT LIKE A SURPRISE GUT PUNCH, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD ALREADY LEFT THE COMPANY.
POD1000000005_S0000412	I REALLY WASN'T AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES.
POD1000000005_S0000413	I MEAN I WOULD HEAR OBVIOUSLY AND YOU'D KIND OF THINK THAT CERTAIN MARKETS WEREN'T DOING WELL AND MAYBE WE NEED TO KIND OF PUSH OR HELP PROMOTE IN THOSE MARKETS.
POD1000000005_S0000414	I DRIVE MORE PR, SEE HOW WE CAN INCREASE FOOT TRAFFIC, BUT NEVER WAS I AWARE THAT THINGS WERE REALLY STARTING TO COME TO A HALT, OR AT LEAST BANKRUPTCY WAS GOING TO BE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
POD1000000005_S0000415	IT'S CHAPTER 11 FILING REALLY LEANED INTO THE CHANG'S IMMIGRANT STORY.
POD1000000005_S0000416	UNDER THE SUBHEADING, FOREVER DREAMING, A ROADMAP TO THE AMERICAN DREAM, IT READ, FOREVER 21 IS A STORY ABOUT FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000417	IN AN AGE WHEN RETAIL, AS MOST AMERICANS KNOW IT, IS UNDER ASSAULT, FOREVER 21 INTENDS TO USE THESE PROCEEDINGS TO REMAIN VIABLE AND WRITE A DIFFERENT ENDING FROM SO MANY RETAIL COMPANIES BEFORE IT.
POD1000000005_S0000418	THE GOAL OF THESE CHAPTER 11 CASES IS CLEAR, EMERGE WITH A VIABLE AND FEASIBLE STANDALONE BUSINESS AND KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE.
POD1000000005_S0000419	AS A PART OF ITS RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT INTENDED TO STREAMLINE ITS RETAIL OPERATION, PUMP UP ITS E COMMERCE GAME, AND SHUT DOWN A WHOLE LOT OF STORES.
POD1000000005_S0000420	NEARLY ALL OF ITS INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AND MORE THAN 100 UNDERPERFORMING U.S. STORES WERE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
POD1000000005_S0000421	THAT'S MORE THAN 40% OF THEIR PHYSICAL RETAIL LOCATIONS.
POD1000000005_S0000422	BUT THOSE PLANS WERE ALL FOR NAUGHT.
POD1000000005_S0000423	IN FEBRUARY, A GROUP OF BUYERS, INCLUDING SOME OF FOREVER 21'S BIGGEST LANDLORDS, PUT IN AN OFFER TO BUY THE BRAND FOR THE BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICE OF $81 MILLION.
POD1000000005_S0000424	A JUDGE APPROVED THE DEAL AND BOOM.
POD1000000005_S0000425	CLOTHING RETAILER FOREVER 21 HAS BEEN SOLD AFTER DECLARING BANKRUPTCY LATE LAST YEAR.
POD1000000005_S0000426	SALE INCLUDES ALL OF FOREVER 21'S ASSETS, INCLUDING ITS REMAINING STORES.
POD1000000005_S0000427	JUST LIKE THAT, THE DREAM DIED.
POD1000000005_S0000428	AFTER 35 YEARS, CONTROL OF FOREVER 21 SLIPPED THROUGH THE CHANG FAMILY'S HANDS.
POD1000000005_S0000429	WHILE THE CHANGS ARE NO LONGER BILLIONAIRES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY THEY DIDN'T REACH SOME TYPE OF AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000430	THEIR ASPIRATIONS OF UPWARD MOBILITY, CLOUT, AND PRESTIGE WERE REALIZED A THOUSAND TIMES OVER.
POD1000000005_S0000431	THEIR CHILDREN ACHIEVED IVY LEAGUE EDUCATIONS AND NEVER WANTED FOR ANYTHING.
POD1000000005_S0000432	THEIR DISTINCTIVE YELLOW SHOPPING BAGS WERE UBIQUITOUS IN MALLS AROUND THE WORLD.
POD1000000005_S0000433	THEY TRULY MADE IT.
POD1000000005_S0000434	PERHAPS WE CAN EVEN SAY THAT BANKRUPTCY IS PART OF THAT AMERICAN DREAM.
POD1000000005_S0000435	THE PART THAT LETS PEOPLE PULL THEMSELVES UP OFF THE GROUND, DUST OFF THEIR SLEEVELESS WIDE LEG JUMPSUITS, AND TRY AGAIN.

POD1000000011_S0000000	HA! GREETINGS, CLASS, AND WELCOME TO COUNTING SCHOOL, WHERE WHAT YOU LEARN REALLY COUNTS.
POD1000000011_S0000001	SO WE WANT TO START TODAY WITH A LITTLE STORY ABOUT AN OLD FRIEND FROM SESAME STREET.
POD1000000011_S0000002	I AM YOUR TEACHER, THE COUNT. DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY CALL ME THE COUNT?
POD1000000011_S0000003	BECAUSE WE LOVE TO BUILD THINGS!
POD1000000011_S0000004	I LOVE THE COUNT AND KEN SCARBOROUGH KNOWS HIM REALLY WELL BECAUSE HE'S HEAD WRITER AT SESAME STREET.
POD1000000011_S0000005	HIS WHOLE IDENTITY IS WRAPPED UP IN BEING A COUNT AND BEING A GUY WHO KNOWS HIS NUMBERS REALLY WELL.
POD1000000011_S0000006	NOW OF COURSE FOR THE COUNT THAT WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE, NUMBERS GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT JOY.
POD1000000011_S0000007	NINE! NINE SANDWICHES ALL TOGETHER!
POD1000000011_S0000009	BUT ON THIS ONE DAY, IT'S DIFFERENT.
POD1000000011_S0000010	THE COUNT MAKES A MISTAKE AND HE SORT OF CANNOT BELIEVE IT. HE'S CRUSHED.
POD1000000011_S0000012	WHAT NUMBER DID HE FORGET?
POD1000000011_S0000013	WELL, SOMEBODY INTERRUPTED HIM. IT'S REALLY NOT HIS FAULT. HE WAS COUNTING SANDWICHES. HE WAS REALLY BEING HELPFUL.
POD1000000011_S0000014	NINE SANDWICHES? ARE YOU SURE IT COUNT?
POD1000000011_S0000015	OH, BUT OF COURSE I AM SURE, CHRIS. I AM THE COUNT.
POD1000000011_S0000016	HA.
POD1000000011_S0000017	UH, THE CAT?
POD1000000011_S0000018	MMM.
POD1000000011_S0000020	ELMO THINKS THE COUNT MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE.
POD1000000011_S0000021	NAMASTE!
POD1000000011_S0000022	YEAH
POD1000000011_S0000023	IT REALLY STRUCK HIM TO HIS CORE AND HE DECIDED HE WASN'T GOING TO BE THE COUNT ANYMORE.
POD1000000011_S0000024	WHOA. SO THE COUNT SCREWS UP. HE MAKES A MISTAKE.
POD1000000011_S0000025	YEAH, AND HE COULDN'T GET OVER IT.
POD1000000011_S0000026	AND YOU KNOW WHAT, COREY? THAT MEANS HE'S PRETTY SIMILAR TO YOU AND ME.
POD1000000011_S0000027	YEAH, BECAUSE MATH ANXIETY IS A REAL THING.
POD1000000011_S0000029	ESTIMATES RANGE UP TO 93% OF AMERICAN ADULTS. THAT'S A LOT, CORY.
POD1000000011_S0000030	YEAH, I DON'T EVEN NEED TO KNOW ANY MATH TO KNOW THAT THAT IS A LOT.
POD1000000011_S0000031	YEAH, 93% OF AMERICAN ADULTS FEEL SOME DEGREE OF ANXIETY THAT IS SPECIFIC TO MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000032	SO IF YOU AVOID DOING YOUR BUDGET OR INVESTING, WELL, WE GOT A LIFE KIT FOR THAT.
POD1000000011_S0000033	YEAH.
POD1000000011_S0000034	BUT ALSO, MATH ANXIETY COULD BE PART OF THE REASON WHY.
POD1000000011_S0000035	WHAT SHOULD ELMO AND THE CAT DO NEXT? THE CAT?
POD1000000011_S0000037	NOTHING!
POD1000000011_S0000038	HUH?
POD1000000011_S0000039	NADA! ZERO! ZILCH! I SHALL NEVER COUNT AGAIN.
POD1000000011_S0000040	WHAT?
POD1000000011_S0000041	AND THE COUNT'S NOT ALONE. ON TESTS, MATH ANXIETY CAN CAUSE STUDENTS TO PERFORM AS THOUGH THEY WERE A WHOLE YEAR BEHIND IN SCHOOL.
POD1000000011_S0000042	YEAH, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR SCHOOLS AND FOR HOW WE TEACH MATH. BUT WHAT CAN WE AS PARENTS DO TO SHAPE OUR KIDS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS MATH?
POD1000000011_S0000043	WE SAT DOWN WITH ROSEMARY TRULIO.
POD1000000011_S0000044	MATH IS EVERYWHERE.
POD1000000011_S0000045	SHE'S THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CURRICULUM AND CONTENT AT SESAME WORKSHOP, AND I PUT THE PROBLEM TO HER THIS WAY.
POD1000000011_S0000046	I FEEL LIKE AS A PARENT, I UNDERSTAND PRETTY WELL HOW TO PROMOTE EARLY LITERACY.
POD1000000011_S0000048	READING BEDTIME STORIES, OR SINGING THE ALPHABET SONG.
POD1000000011_S0000049	BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT ON THE MATH SIDE OF THINGS, I JUST DRAW A BLANK.
POD1000000011_S0000050	AND I WANT YOU GUYS TO HELP ME FILL IN THAT BLANK. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO PROMOTE THE LOVE OF MATH EARLY ON?
POD1000000011_S0000051	YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO GET THEM TO LOVE MATH. THEY ALREADY LOVE MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000052	WHAT?!
POD1000000011_S0000053	YES, THEY'RE NOT COMING INTO THIS WORLD NOT LIKING MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000055	SO LET'S FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN SOLVE THIS LITTLE MATH EQUATION HERE.
POD1000000011_S0000056	YOU'RE LISTENING TO NPR'S LIFE KIT FOR PARENTING WITH SESAME WORKSHOP. I'M ANYA KAMENETZ. I'M NOT AFRAID OF A CORNY JOKE.
POD1000000011_S0000057	I'M COREY TURNER, AND AFTER THE BREAK, WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU SOME TIPS THAT YOU CAN USE STARTING IN THE EARLY YEARS.
POD1000000011_S0000058	BUT ALSO STRATEGIES YOU CAN KEEP RETURNING TO EVEN WHEN YOU'RE GROWN UP AND NO MATTER HOW OLD YOUR KIDS ARE, AS WELL AS WHAT TO NEVER EVER SAY TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000060	SUPPORT FOR THIS NPR PODCAST AND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE COME FROM LINKEDIN AND THE NEW LINKEDIN LEARNING, WHICH OFFERS OVER 13,000 ONLINE COURSES TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS.

POD1000000011_S0000065	YOU'RE LISTENING TO LIFE KIT FOR PARENTING WITH SESAME WORKSHOP. IN THIS EPISODE, WE'RE GOING TO DO THE EQUIVALENT OF FLIPPING TO THE BACK OF THE BOOK TO LOOK RIGHT AT THE ANSWERS.
POD1000000011_S0000066	YEP.
POD1000000011_S0000067	BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT BY LISTENING TO THIS MATH EPISODE, YOU HAD TO OVERCOME SOME ANXIETIES, I BET, OF YOUR OWN.
POD1000000011_S0000068	YEAH, SO LET'S GET RIGHT TO OUR TAKEAWAYS. AND NUMBER ONE, DON'T LET YOUR MATH ANXIETY HOLD YOUR KIDS BACK.
POD1000000011_S0000069	MATH ANXIETY, AS WE MENTIONED, IS A REAL PHENOMENON ALL OVER THE WORLD.
POD1000000011_S0000070	YEAH, AND IT'S PRETTY CLEARLY RELATED TO HOW WE TEACH MATH IN SCHOOL. THINGS LIKE TIMED PRACTICE AND MEMORIZATION AND HIGH STAKES TESTING AND OH MY GOSH, I'M GETTING HOT FLASHES AND SWEATY PALMS JUST THINKING ABOUT FACT TESTS.
POD1000000011_S0000071	UGH.
POD1000000011_S0000072	AND HERE'S THE REALLY UPSETTING THING, IS THAT MATH ANXIETY, IT'S NOT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.
POD1000000011_S0000073	THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S TIED TO STEREOTYPES, RACE, AND ESPECIALLY GENDER. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOTHERS AND PRESCHOOL TEACHERS WHO ARE OVERWHELMINGLY WOMEN, THEY CAN PASS THAT FEELING ON TO THEIR KIDS, ESPECIALLY TO THEIR GIRLS.
POD1000000011_S0000074	BUT THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS.
POD1000000011_S0000075	CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN WITH MATH ANXIETY. IT'S PASSED ON TO THEM, SO I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO CHECK OURSELVES.
POD1000000011_S0000076	IN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000077	THIS WAS KIND OF A SURPRISE FOR ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT, YOU KNOW, IF MY KID HAD A PROBLEM WITH MATH, I COULD BOND WITH HIM BY SAYING, HEY, YOU KNOW, IT WAS TOUGH FOR ME TOO.
POD1000000011_S0000078	BUT ACTUALLY, ROSEMARY SAYS...
POD1000000011_S0000079	SAYING, I DON'T LIKE MATH, I CAN'T DO MATH, THAT WILL GET CONVEYED TO YOUR CHILDREN.
POD1000000011_S0000080	AND THE SOLUTION INSTEAD? WE NEED TO REFRAME MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000081	YEAH, ROSEMARY SAYS, THINK ABOUT THE FUN ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BACK UP AND REINFORCE WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING IN SCHOOL.
POD1000000011_S0000082	MATH IS VERY MUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF YOUR LIFE. DO YOU LOVE MUSIC?
POD1000000011_S0000083	I DO. I LOVE TO SING.
POD1000000011_S0000084	ALRIGHT, IF YOU LOVE MUSIC, THEN YOU LOVE MATH. DO YOU LIKE TO COOK AND BAKE?
POD1000000011_S0000085	I LOVE TO COOK AND BAKE!
POD1000000011_S0000086	OKAY, THEN YOU LOVE MATH BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO MUSIC AND YOU CAN'T COOK AND BAKE WITHOUT MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000087	SO I CAN'T COOK OR BAKE REALLY, AND I DEFINITELY CANNOT SING, BUT I LOVE BASEBALL, FOR EXAMPLE. AND MY BOYS AND I, WE TALK ABOUT BASEBALL STATISTICS ALL THE TIME.
POD1000000011_S0000088	SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT, ROSEMARY SAYS, IS RECOGNIZING MATH AS PART OF MANY THINGS THAT WE LIKE DOING TOGETHER.
POD1000000011_S0000089	EXACTLY. AND SO TO SEE MORE ABOUT HOW ADULTS CAN WEAVE MATH INTO OUR EVERYDAY MOMENTS OF LIFE, EVEN WITH REALLY LITTLE KIDS, YOU AND I AND OUR PRODUCER LAUREN MCGACKIE VISITED A REALLY SPECIAL PRESCHOOL.
POD1000000011_S0000091	THEY CAME TO WATCH US PLAY TODAY.
POD1000000011_S0000092	BYE!
POD1000000011_S0000093	THIS IS THE CENTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. IT'S OUR RESEARCH PRESCHOOL AT EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY. THE LOBBY HAS THIS GIANT, SUPER REALISTIC OAK TREE.
POD1000000011_S0000094	YEAH, WHICH I CLIMBED INSIDE. VERY COOL.
POD1000000011_S0000095	NICE TO SEE YOU. GOOD MORNING.
POD1000000011_S0000096	WE SHOULD ALSO SAY, ANIA, ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS AT THIS SCHOOL SPEAK SPANISH AT HOME.
POD1000000011_S0000097	THAT'S RIGHT. AND AT THE PRESCHOOL, WE SAT DOWN WITH ONE OF THE LEAD RESEARCHERS, SUDHASWAMINATHAN, AND SHE HELPED US UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE ABOUT HOW TO GROW CHILDREN WHO LOVE MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000098	THE MINUTE WE SAY MATH, WE TRY TO THINK OF THE BIG PICTURE, YOU KNOW, BIG OLD THEOREMS, BIG OLD GEOMETRY CONCEPTS.
POD1000000011_S0000099	INSTEAD, SWAMINATHAN SAYS, THINK SMALL. SHE'S A PROFESSOR IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AT EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE, AND HER SPECIAL FOCUS IS ON EARLY MATH LEARNING.
POD1000000011_S0000100	AND SUDA AND HER COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE LOTS OF RESEARCH TO SEE WHAT KINDS OF CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES LEAD TO BETTER PERFORMANCE IN MATH LATER ON.
POD1000000011_S0000101	AND ONE OF THEIR ANSWERS MAKES UP OUR SECOND TAKEAWAY. TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO.
POD1000000011_S0000102	TALK ABOUT MATH. TAKE THIS REALLY ORDINARY MOMENT.
POD1000000011_S0000103	YOU ASK THEM TO PUT THEIR BOOKS AWAY AND SAY IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE SHELF, SO WHY DOESN'T IT FIT?
POD1000000011_S0000104	MAYBE IT'S THE BOOK IS TOO TALL, TOO BIG.
POD1000000011_S0000105	SUDA SAYS YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT A MATH PROCESS. IT'S PROBLEM SOLVING.
POD1000000011_S0000106	YEAH, AND WE HEARD LOTS OF THIS BY THE WAY MATH TALK AT THE PRESCHOOL.
POD1000000011_S0000108	DOES THE DUCK FIT IN THERE TOO? HMM. HE DIDN'T FIT WHEN HE WAS STANDING UP.
POD1000000011_S0000109	SO YOU DECIDED TO LAY HIM DOWN. DOES HE FIT NOW?
POD1000000011_S0000110	BUT THAT'S AMY LOPEZ, THE LEAD TEACHER FOR THE TODDLER CLASSROOM.
POD1000000011_S0000111	IT'S A SUNNY ROOM WITH A COZY READING CORNER, THERE'S A PLAY KITCHEN, AND BLOCKS.
POD1000000011_S0000112	AND NEAR THE CENTER OF THE ROOM THERE'S THIS TABLE AND AMY'S SITTING WITH THE CHILDREN. THEY'RE BUILDING TOGETHER WITH MAGNETILES, WHICH ARE THESE COLORFUL PLASTIC BLOCKS WITH DIFFERENT SHAPES THAT STICK TOGETHER.
POD1000000011_S0000113	AND THEY ALSO HAVE LITTLE PLASTIC FARM ANIMALS. AND ONE OF THE KIDS IS KIND OF PUTTING TOGETHER A HOUSE.
POD1000000011_S0000114	NOW YOU'RE USING TRIANGLES AND SQUARES.
POD1000000011_S0000116	NAMING THE SHAPES IN BOTH ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH, WHEN WE PLAYED THIS TAPE FOR ROSEMARY, SHE SAID,
POD1000000011_S0000117	WHAT I HEARD THERE IS THE TEACHER USING DESCRIPTIVE MATH LANGUAGE. AND THAT IS SO KEY FOR CHILDREN TO UNDERSTAND MATH CONCEPTS.
POD1000000011_S0000118	YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE.
POD1000000011_S0000119	YEAH, AND AMY'S NOT BUILDING THE BOX FOR THE KIDS. SHE'S ACTUALLY MAKING OBSERVATIONS AND KIND OF LIKE NARRATING THEIR THOUGHTS IN REAL TIME.
POD1000000011_S0000120	THE MORE BLOCKS YOU ADD, THE LONGER IT GETS. COHEN, I NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU ADDED MORE, YOUR LINE GOT LONGER AND LONGER.
POD1000000011_S0000121	WHEN SHE SAID MORE BLOCKS TO MAKE IT LONGER. I MEAN LONGER IS A COMPLEX WORD FOR CHILDREN.
POD1000000011_S0000122	AND THEY NEED TO HEAR THAT LANGUAGE, AND THEY NEED TO HEAR THAT LANGUAGE IN A VERY CONCRETE WAY.
POD1000000011_S0000123	SHE WASN'T EVEN AFRAID TO USE REALLY TECHNICAL WORDS, LIKE WHEN THIS LITTLE BOY WAS TRYING TO MAKE HIS LITTLE CORRAL STAND UP.
POD1000000011_S0000124	NOW YOU CAN PUT THEM ALL AROUND THE PERIMETER, ALL AROUND THE EDGE.
POD1000000011_S0000125	PERIMETER.
POD1000000011_S0000126	YEAH.
POD1000000011_S0000127	ANOTHER GREAT OCCASION TO TALK MATH, AS ROSEMARY SAID EARLIER, IS IN MUSIC CLASS.
POD1000000011_S0000128	I'M GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY TWO RHYTHM STICKS. ONE FOR EACH HAND. WE HAVE SMOOTH RHYTHM STICKS.
POD1000000011_S0000129	DO YOU WANT TO TOUCH IT?
POD1000000011_S0000131	FEAR.
POD1000000011_S0000132	DAD?
POD1000000011_S0000133	YEP.
POD1000000011_S0000135	YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THE KAI AND KORY, THEY'RE PERFECT FOR HITTING YOUR FRIENDS.
POD1000000011_S0000136	YEAH.
POD1000000011_S0000137	DO WE TAP THEM ON OUR FRIENDS?
POD1000000011_S0000138	NO!
POD1000000011_S0000139	DO WE BANG THEM ON THE FLOOR?
POD1000000011_S0000140	BYE!
POD1000000011_S0000141	WHAT COULD HAPPEN?
POD1000000011_S0000142	AND AFTER THIS MOMENT, THE CHILDREN PRACTICE GOING FASTER.
POD1000000011_S0000144	AND THEN THEY GO SLOW.
POD1000000011_S0000145	MWAH!
POD1000000011_S0000147	FASTER AND SLOWER ARE RELATIONAL CONCEPTS. THESE ARE MATH WORDS RELATED TO RHYTHM.
POD1000000011_S0000148	SO WHEN WE WERE TALKING TO ROSEMARY, I HAD AN EPIPHANY ON YA THAT MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SESAME STREET MOMENT
POD1000000011_S0000149	AND I WATCHED A LOT OF SESAME AS A KID.
POD1000000011_S0000150	THAT'S NOT OBVIOUS.
POD1000000011_S0000152	IT WAS A MATH MOMENT! AND IT'S WITH MY FAVORITE CHARACTER, GROVER.
POD1000000011_S0000153	HMM.
POD1000000011_S0000154	AND SO HE'S STANDING THERE IN THE FOREGROUND AND HE SAYS,
POD1000000011_S0000155	OH, I...
POD1000000011_S0000156	AND THEN HE GOES WAY BACK HERE.
POD1000000011_S0000158	THERE!
POD1000000011_S0000160	HMM?
POD1000000011_S0000162	FAR! EPIPHANY!
POD1000000011_S0000164	SO THE POINT IS PARENTS GET APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION BILLION CHANCES ALL DAY LONG, EVERY DAY, EVERY NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000165	THAT IS, OF COURSE, A ROUGH ESTIMATE, BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
POD1000000011_S0000166	THEY'RE CALENDARS AND CLOCKS, MONEY, MAPS, MEASURING CRAFTS.
POD1000000011_S0000167	IT'S VERY BROAD. AND I THINK THAT ONCE PARENTS UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF HOW WE DEFINE MATH AND HOW THEY ARE ALREADY DOING IT, THEY GO, OH, THAT'S MATH?
POD1000000011_S0000168	I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS MATH. OH, IF THAT'S MATH, THEN I COULD DO THAT.
POD1000000011_S0000169	SETTING THE TABLE 1 TO 1 CORRESPONDENCE, THAT'S MATH. ORDINAL NUMBER, FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, THAT'S MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000170	YEAH, AND IF YOU NEED EVEN MORE CHANCES, ROLL THE DICE IN OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY, TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE.
POD1000000011_S0000171	PLAY MATH.
POD1000000011_S0000172	FIND WAYS TO KEEP MATH IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR KIDS. SUDA SAYS YOU MAY ALREADY BE DOING THIS.
POD1000000011_S0000173	JUST PLAY.
POD1000000011_S0000174	AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN PARENTS JUST PLAY, THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALLY, REALLY GOOD AT PULLING OUT THESE DEEP CONCEPTS FROM CHILDREN MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN TEACHERS.
POD1000000011_S0000175	THERE'S SO MANY WAYS TO PLAY MATH WITH KIDS OF ALL DIFFERENT AGES.
POD1000000011_S0000176	RIGHT, THERE ARE PUZZLES OF COURSE, AND BLOCKS LIKE WE HEARD WITH AMY.
POD1000000011_S0000177	THERE'S VIDEO GAMES AND APPS, CARD GAMES, AND ESPECIALLY BOARD GAMES.
POD1000000011_S0000178	RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE MORE KIDS PLAY ANY GAME WITH DICE AND NUMBERED SQUARES, THE BETTER THEIR BASIC MATH SKILLS GET.
POD1000000011_S0000179	YOU CAN EVEN PLAY MATH OUTSIDE.
POD1000000011_S0000180	I CAN GIVE A BIG PUSH TO THE SWING OR I CAN HOP THREE TIMES TO GO THERE.
POD1000000011_S0000181	AT SUDA'S HOUSE, HOPSCOTCH HAD NEGATIVE ONE.
POD1000000011_S0000183	WHICH WAS KIND OF MIND BLOWING TO ME.
POD1000000011_S0000184	YEAH.
POD1000000011_S0000185	AND SHE SAYS, YOU KNOW, PLAY CAN BE THE FOUNDATION EVEN OF ADVANCED SUBJECTS LIKE ALGEBRA.
POD1000000011_S0000186	ALGEBRA IS, YOU KNOW, OF ALL THE MATH CONCEPTS, ALGEBRA SEEMS TO SHAKE MANY PEOPLE'S NERVES.
POD1000000011_S0000187	BUT WHAT IS ALGEBRA REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT?
POD1000000011_S0000188	IT IS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE PATTERNS IN NUMBERS, THERE ARE PATTERNS IN EQUATIONS, AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THE TWO SIDES OF IT.
POD1000000011_S0000189	TAKE THIS LITTLE MOMENT IN AMY LOPEZ'S TODDLER ROOM.
POD1000000011_S0000190	WHEN YOU PUT YOUR TRIANGLES TOGETHER IT MAKES A SQUARE. LOOK!
POD1000000011_S0000191	PIM PIM.
POD1000000011_S0000192	SAME, SAME, THEY MATCH.
POD1000000011_S0000194	JUST LIKE THAT ONE. YOU MADE ONE THAT IS THE SAME. GREAT DISCOVERY.
POD1000000011_S0000195	SAME, SAME.
POD1000000011_S0000196	EXACTLY. SO AS YOU KNOW, COREY, I HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD AT HOME AND I WAS GETTING SO EXCITED AT THIS POINT.
POD1000000011_S0000197	BECAUSE I FELT LIKE, HEY, I'M READY TO BE THE A PLUS AP EXTRA CREDIT MOM.
POD1000000011_S0000198	I'M GONNA NARRATE EVERY MOMENT OF BLOCK TIME. I'M GONNA USE PERIMETER AND QUADRADO.
POD1000000011_S0000199	REIGN IT IN, KAMINETS.
POD1000000011_S0000200	UGH, WHAT?
POD1000000011_S0000201	COME ON, I'M RARING TO GO, LET'S GO TO THOSE FLASHCARDS. COME ON.
POD1000000011_S0000203	REMEMBER, STUDENT WARNED US.
POD1000000011_S0000204	AND THIS REALLY RINGS TRUE FOR ME.
POD1000000011_S0000205	ONE THING I WOULD TELL PARENTS NOT TO DO IS TO BECOME THE TEACHER IN THE HOUSE.
POD1000000011_S0000206	AH, HMM, ALRIGHT.
POD1000000011_S0000207	I GET THIS.
POD1000000011_S0000208	YEAH, I MEAN, FOR ONE THING, IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING.
POD1000000011_S0000209	YOU KNOW WHEN WE PLAY WITH OUR FRIENDS WE ARE NOT CONSTANTLY ASKING THEM LET'S COUNT HOW MANY THERE IS, WHAT IS THE SHAPE, WE DON'T DO THAT.
POD1000000011_S0000210	SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I DO WITH MY FRIENDS. I MIGHT QUIZ MY FRIENDS.
POD1000000011_S0000212	I DON'T WANNA HANG OUT WITH YOU.
POD1000000011_S0000213	FINE
POD1000000011_S0000214	ALRIGHT, THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON TO NOT BE SO HEAVY HANDED WHEN WE'RE PLAYING WITH OUR KIDS IS TAKE AWAY NUMBER FOUR.
POD1000000011_S0000215	MATH, LIKE LIFE, IS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND FUN WHEN WE CAN GET BEYOND RIGHT AND WRONG ANSWERS.
POD1000000011_S0000216	FOR EXAMPLE, SUDA SAID THIS.
POD1000000011_S0000217	WE ARE SITTING AT A ROUND TABLE AND I COULD ASK YOU, ANYA, WHAT'S THE SHAPE OF THIS TABLE?
POD1000000011_S0000218	KNOW IT'S A CIRCLE, YOU KNOW IT
POD1000000011_S0000219	I MEAN, SO IT'S A, BUT A BETTER QUESTION WOULD BE TO SAY, ANYA, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE CIRCLE FOR OUR TABLE?
POD1000000011_S0000220	THAT IS BETTER BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN MY ANSWER. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY.
POD1000000011_S0000221	I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DID THAT RIGHT BUT THAT GETS US TALKING ABOUT SHAPES
POD1000000011_S0000222	IT'S A REAL CONVERSATION.
POD1000000011_S0000223	YES, AND IT'S THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT YOU COULD HAVE WITH KIDS AT ALMOST ANY AGE.
POD1000000011_S0000224	OR ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION SUDA SAYS MIGHT BE, HOW DO YOU KNOW THE TABLE IS ROUND?
POD1000000011_S0000225	IT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM LOOK AT THAT CIRCLE ONE MORE TIME AND TO SEE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IT FEELS CURVY AND THE OTHER ONE FEELS SHARP ON THE EDGE.
POD1000000011_S0000226	SO THE KEY HERE IS TO KEEP THINGS OPEN ENDED.
POD1000000011_S0000227	SO WE SAW ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IN ONE OF THE OTHER PRESCHOOL CLASSROOMS. THERE'S A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY NAMED KILLY'S KIND OF MESSING AROUND WITH SOME BLOCKS.
POD1000000011_S0000228	AND THE TEACHER, CARLA ALAMO, WAS A MASTER. SHE JUST BACKED OFF AND LET HIM DO HIS THING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HERE.
POD1000000011_S0000229	HE'S TRYING THINGS OUT. HE'S TESTING OUT HYPOTHESES.
POD1000000011_S0000230	THIS IS DATA. IT'S PROBABILITY.
POD1000000011_S0000231	IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING TO A CERTAIN PLACE IN THE END.
POD1000000011_S0000232	DO YOU WANT THE WHEEL TO GO UNDER IT OR OVER IT?
POD1000000011_S0000233	OVER.
POD1000000011_S0000234	OVER IT
POD1000000011_S0000235	YEAH, AND REMEMBER, THIS IS PLAY. IT'S OPEN ENDED.
POD1000000011_S0000236	THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG. SHE'S LETTING HIM FIGURE IT OUT.
POD1000000011_S0000237	DO WE NEED TO CHANGE ANY BLOCKS OR ADD ANYTHING TO MAKE IT JUMP HIGHER?
POD1000000011_S0000239	AND ROSEMARY SAYS THERE'S A SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL POINT WE'RE MAKING THAT GOES DEEPER EVEN THAN THE MATH HERE.
POD1000000011_S0000240	THERE SHOULD BE NO FEAR IN MAKING A MISTAKE.
POD1000000011_S0000241	LET'S SAY THAT AGAIN. NO FEAR IN MAKING A MISTAKE.
POD1000000011_S0000242	THAT'S BASICALLY HOW CHILDREN LEARN. IT'S ALL TRIAL AND ERROR FOR THEM.
POD1000000011_S0000243	AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING TO US HOW WE REACT TO MAKING A MISTAKE. AND THAT'S PART OF RESILIENCY.
POD1000000011_S0000244	AND IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO COMMUNICATE THIS ATTITUDE WHEN OUR KIDS ARE A LITTLE OLDER, LIKE MINE ARE, AND THEY'RE LEARNING MATH IN SCHOOL ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S SCHEDULE.
POD1000000011_S0000245	YEAH, I MEAN THE PRESSURE JUST GETS HIGHER FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND SO THE MOST HELPFUL THAT WE CAN BE AS PARENTS IS NOT TO BE FROG MARCHING THEM THROUGH THEIR HOMEWORK BUT TRY TO MAKE IT FEEL OKAY TO MESS UP SOMETIMES AND ALSO TO KEEP GOING.
POD1000000011_S0000246	BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART OF THE PROCESS.
POD1000000011_S0000247	YEAH, FAILURE IS IMPORTANT, WHICH IS A LESSON THE COUNT HAD TO LEARN.
POD1000000011_S0000248	OH, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. I, THE COUNT, MADE A COUNTING MISTAKE.
POD1000000011_S0000249	JUST A LITTLE ONE. OH, THE CAT.
POD1000000011_S0000250	SO AS WE SAID IN THE BEGINNING, HE MESSED UP. IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.
POD1000000011_S0000251	HE DECIDES TO QUIT BEING THE CAT.
POD1000000011_S0000252	YEAH, AND HE GOES IN SEARCH OF OTHER IMPLANTS.
POD1000000011_S0000253	ALL RIGHT, CONSTRUCTION WORKER. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAMMER FIVE NAILS INTO THIS HERE BEAM.
POD1000000011_S0000254	ALRIGHT.
POD1000000011_S0000255	BUT IT TURNS OUT THERE'S THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO COUNT IN DOING CONSTRUCTION AND MEASURING AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF. SO THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT THERE.
POD1000000011_S0000256	AGAIN, THIS IS KEN SCARBOROUGH, THE HEAD WRITER AT SESAME.
POD1000000011_S0000257	SO HE LEFT THAT, HE BECAME A ROCKET GUY, THEY'D HAVE TO COUNT DOWN.
POD1000000011_S0000258	10, OH, 9.
POD1000000011_S0000260	AND WHAT FINALLY GETS THE COW PACK ON TRACK IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER MISTAKE.
POD1000000011_S0000261	HIS FRIEND ELMO STEPS IN AND PRETENDS TO MESS UP HIS OWN COUNTING JUST TO HELP THE COUNT KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY TO MESS UP.
POD1000000011_S0000262	56789!
POD1000000011_S0000263	BUT I NEED TEN CARROTS!
POD1000000011_S0000264	WAIT, UH, I BELIEVE YOU MADE A MISTAKE, ELMO.
POD1000000011_S0000265	OH, A MISTAKE?
POD1000000011_S0000266	YES, YOU SAID FOUR TWICE. YOU SHOULD COUNT THE CARROTS AGAIN.
POD1000000011_S0000267	ELMO CAN'T DO THAT TO COUNT. ELMO MADE A MISTAKE, SO ELMO'S GONNA GIVE UP COUNT.
POD1000000011_S0000268	GIVE UP?
POD1000000011_S0000269	GIVE UP!
POD1000000011_S0000270	NO, NO, NO, ELMO. EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES.
POD1000000011_S0000271	YOU CANNOT GIVE UP. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO KEEP TRYING.
POD1000000011_S0000272	SUDA ACTUALLY TOLD US THIS IS A GOOD TIP FOR PARENTS TO TRY TOO. YOU CAN MAKE A MISTAKE AND GIVE YOUR KIDS A CHANCE TO CORRECT YOU WITH MATH OR YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE.
POD1000000011_S0000273	I DID GIVE UP, BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE. I MUST KEEP TRYING, AND YOU SHOULD TOO.
POD1000000011_S0000274	YEAH!
POD1000000011_S0000275	SO, COME, LET'S COUNT THE CARROTS TOGETHER.
POD1000000011_S0000276	COOL!
POD1000000011_S0000278	ONE CARROT?
POD1000000011_S0000279	AND JUST THE WAY ELMO DID, YOU CAN BUILD UP THEIR CONFIDENCE.
POD1000000011_S0000280	NINE!
POD1000000011_S0000281	TEN CARROTS ALL TOGETHER!
POD1000000011_S0000283	SO WE STARTED OFF THIS EPISODE TALKING ABOUT A TOPIC THAT I DON'T PARTICULARLY LOVE, MATH. BUT WE ENDED UP SOMEWHERE REALLY GREAT, COREY.
POD1000000011_S0000284	BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN I REALIZE THAT THROUGH EXPLORING THE WORLD WITH MY KID, I CAN SPARK MY CURIOSITY, I CAN LOOK AT STUFF WITH NEW EYES.
POD1000000011_S0000285	AND I CAN GO BACK AND GET A REDO ON SOMETHING THAT WASN'T SO FUN FOR ME WHEN I WAS A KID.
POD1000000011_S0000286	YEAH, AND I GOT TO DO MY GROVER IMPRESSION.
POD1000000011_S0000288	GREAT! SAME, SAME! EVEN STEVEN!
POD1000000011_S0000289	SAME, SAME. ALRIGHT, TIME FOR A RECAP!
POD1000000011_S0000290	WE GOTTA GO THROUGH ALL OUR TAKEAWAYS, BUT GOSH, I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY WE HAD.
POD1000000011_S0000291	ANYA, DO YOU REMEMBER?
POD1000000011_S0000292	NO, I DON'T THINK I REMEMBER. MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME HELP?
POD1000000011_S0000296	I'VE WAITED ALL SEASON TO DO THAT.
POD1000000011_S0000297	AWESOME.
POD1000000011_S0000298	ALL RIGHT, SO TAKEAWAY NUMBER ONE, DON'T LET YOUR MATH ANXIETY HOLD YOUR KIDS BACK.
POD1000000011_S0000299	YEAH, FIND MATH AND EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ENJOY TOGETHER.
POD1000000011_S0000300	TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO, TALK MATH.

POD1000000011_S0000311	EVEN PROBABILITY IN ALGEBRA. AND TAKE AWAY NUMBER FOUR, LET'S STAY AWAY FROM THE RIGHT AND WRONG ANSWERS.
POD1000000011_S0000312	KEEP THINGS OPEN ENDED.
POD1000000011_S0000313	BECAUSE MATH, LIKE LIFE, IS SO MUCH MORE FUN AND INTERESTING THAT WAY. AND SO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
POD1000000011_S0000314	I'M INSPIRED. I'M GONNA DO LIKE THE COUNT. I'M GONNA PUT MY CAPE BACK ON.
POD1000000011_S0000315	AND I'M GONNA GO REDISCOVER MY LOVE OF MATH.

POD1000000012_S0000018	ALSO IN THE STUDIO WITH COOKIE AND MYSELF WAS ROSEMARY TRULIO. SHE IS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CURRICULUM AND CONTENT AT SESAME WORKSHOP.
POD1000000012_S0000019	WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SELF REGULATION.
POD1000000012_S0000020	REGULATION, WHAT REGULATION?
POD1000000012_S0000021	THAT'S HOW WE HELP YOU STAY CALM AND RESIST THE IMPULSES OF ALWAYS EATING COOKIE.
POD1000000012_S0000022	SORRY, YOU, YOU NO WANT ME TO EAT COOKIE.

POD1000000012_S0000044	WELL, WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR HER.
POD1000000012_S0000045	THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. AND SHARING WOULD BE THE KIND THING TO DO, DON'T YOU THINK, COOKIE?

POD1000000012_S0000052	OKAY, COOKIE
POD1000000012_S0000054	LET'S STOP AND THINK HERE.
POD1000000012_S0000055	YEAH.
POD1000000012_S0000056	HOW CAN WE DISTRACT OURSELVES SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO FOCUS ON THESE COOKIES RIGHT NOW?
POD1000000012_S0000058	HOW ABOUT WE START WITH SOME NICE, DEEP BELLY BREATHING?
POD1000000012_S0000059	OH, ME KNOW THAT ONE.
POD1000000012_S0000061	THAT.
POD1000000012_S0000062	OKAY, SO IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE.
POD1000000012_S0000064	AND SLOWLY OUT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.
POD1000000012_S0000065	COOKIE, YOU'RE BREATHING ON THE COOKIES.
POD1000000012_S0000066	AND ME TUMMY GRUMBLING. YOU KNOW, ME TUMMY HAS OTHER IDEAS.
POD1000000012_S0000067	WE GOT TO TRY A DIFFERENT STRATEGY. YOU KNOW, ME NOT GONNA LOOK AT COOKIES.
POD1000000012_S0000068	HOW ABOUT THAT?
POD1000000012_S0000069	COOKIE, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA AND A GREAT STRATEGY. WE'RE GOING TO TURN OUR BACKS ON THESE COOKIES. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THEM.
POD1000000012_S0000070	OH, OK. IT'S NOT EASY BECAUSE ME STILL CAN SMELL COOKIES.
POD1000000012_S0000071	OH BOY.
POD1000000012_S0000072	ROSEMARY, I DON'T THINK THAT'S WORKING.
POD1000000012_S0000073	YO
POD1000000012_S0000075	I GOT ONE.
POD1000000012_S0000076	I GOT ONE COOKIE.
POD1000000012_S0000077	YEAH.
POD1000000012_S0000078	HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING INTERESTING LATELY?
POD1000000012_S0000079	UH, WELL ME JUST FINISHED DR. ZHIVAGO.
POD1000000012_S0000080	REALLY?
POD1000000012_S0000081	YEAH.
POD1000000012_S0000082	WHAT, HOW WAS IT?
POD1000000012_S0000083	OH, IT DELICIOUS.
POD1000000012_S0000085	IT'LL DRY.
POD1000000012_S0000086	WE HAD TO DUNK IT IN MILK.
POD1000000012_S0000088	OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS.
POD1000000012_S0000089	WE HAVE THESE COOKIES HERE, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY MILK.
POD1000000012_S0000090	WE'VE GOT A FRIDGE. I'M GONNA GO. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
POD1000000012_S0000091	OKAY.
POD1000000012_S0000092	IS IT IS IT SAFE TO LEAVE THE COOKIES HERE? ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?
POD1000000012_S0000094	I'M NOT GONNA TRY MY BEST, CORY.
POD1000000012_S0000096	PROMISING ANYTHING.
POD1000000012_S0000097	OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
POD1000000012_S0000099	HURRY, THERE HE GOES!
POD1000000012_S0000100	OH, COOKIES LOOK SO YUMMY!
POD1000000012_S0000102	OKAY, WELL COOKIE MONSTER WAITS IN FRONT OF THAT BIG PLATE OF COOKIES AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE HIM WAIT A WHILE.
POD1000000012_S0000103	LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND WHEN WE COME BACK, MORE ON THE SCIENCE AND THE ART OF SELF REGULATION.
POD1000000012_S0000105	SUPPORT FOR THIS NPR PODCAST AND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE COME FROM LINKEDIN AND THE NEW LINKEDIN LEARNING, WHICH OFFERS OVER 13,000 ONLINE COURSES TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS.

POD1000000012_S0000109	WE'RE BACK. THIS IS COREY.
POD1000000012_S0000110	AND I'M ON YA.
POD1000000012_S0000111	AND WE'RE GOING TO FINISH OUR COMBO WITH COOKIE MONSTER IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.
POD1000000012_S0000112	BUT FIRST WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE, IT'S PRETTY SURPRISING THAT COOKIES BECOME SO SKILLED AT SELF REGULATION.
POD1000000012_S0000113	SO I REMEMBER AS A CHILD WATCHING COOKIE MONSTER AND JUST BEING LIKE, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS MANIAC?
POD1000000012_S0000115	THAT'S KENTARO FUJITA, AN EXPERT ON SELF REGULATION WHO WE'LL TALK TO IN A BIT.
POD1000000012_S0000116	AND YEAH, I HAVE TO AGREE ON YA, THE COOKIE WE GREW UP WITH?
POD1000000012_S0000117	COWABUNGA!
POD1000000012_S0000119	WAS PURE
POD1000000012_S0000121	FUZZY!
POD1000000012_S0000123	OKAY!
POD1000000012_S0000125	BUT ROSEMARY FROM SESAME SAYS COOKIE'S TRANSFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY REALLY, REALLY INTENTIONAL.
POD1000000012_S0000126	SESAME STREET, EVERY YEAR WE FOCUS ON A CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL NEED IN CHILDREN'S LIVES.
POD1000000012_S0000127	AND IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN ALL OF THIS RESEARCH STARTED TO COME OUT SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE SELF REGULATION SKILLS AND HOW THEY WERE RELATED TO SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT, SCHOOL READINESS, AND LIFE LESSONS.
POD1000000012_S0000129	AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY.
POD1000000012_S0000130	YEAH, AND SESAME DECIDED ONCE THEY KNEW ALL OF THIS, THAT COOKIE MONSTER WAS THE PERFECT MUPPET TO SEND THIS MESSAGE.
POD1000000012_S0000131	LET'S NOT DEFINE HIM AS THIS IMPULSIVE CHARACTER WHO HAS NO SELF CONTROL BECAUSE HE CAN HAVE SELF CONTROL.
POD1000000012_S0000132	SO AFTER
POD1000000012_S0000134	THREE YEARS.
POD1000000012_S0000135	COOKIE EVOLVES!
POD1000000012_S0000136	YES!
POD1000000012_S0000137	AND HE BECOMES SOMEONE WHO WAS.
POD1000000012_S0000138	IS MUCH MORE REFLECTIVE, WHO CAN ACTUALLY STOP AND PAUSE AND CONTROL HIS EMOTION AND HIS DESIRE FOR EATING THE COOKIE RIGHT AWAY.
POD1000000012_S0000139	THAT'S INSPIRING, ROSEMARIE.
POD1000000012_S0000140	YES, IT IS.
POD1000000012_S0000142	IT'S INSPIRING FOR ME AS A 42 YEAR OLD THAT I HAVE ONE MORE YEAR TO GET ALL MY SELF CONTROL TOGETHER.
POD1000000012_S0000143	I BELIEVE IN YOU.
POD1000000012_S0000144	WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SESAME'S HOPE HERE WAS...
POD1000000012_S0000145	THAT WE COULD MODEL THESE STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN AND APPLY THESE STRATEGIES AND BUILD THEIR OWN SELF REGULATION TOOLBOX.
POD1000000012_S0000146	AND SEVERAL YEARS AGO, SESAME BACK TO STUDY TO SEE IF THIS COULD REALLY WORK.
POD1000000012_S0000147	AND SO SOME OF THE KIDS IN THE STUDY WATCHED VIDEOS OF COOKIE MONSTER PRACTICING HIS STRATEGIES, KIND OF LIKE YOU HEARD AT THE TOP OF THE PODCAST.
POD1000000012_S0000148	ME GOT NEW STRATEGY!
POD1000000012_S0000150	THEN, ROSEMARY SAYS, THE RESEARCHER TEMPTED ALL THE KIDS WITH THEIR FAVORITE SNACK.
POD1000000012_S0000151	CHOCOLATE CHIPPIES?
POD1000000012_S0000153	AND THE KIDS WHO WATCHED COOKIE MONSTER?
POD1000000012_S0000154	ON AVERAGE, WAITED FOUR ADDITIONAL MINUTES.
POD1000000012_S0000155	THAT IS HUGE FOR A PRESCHOOLER.
POD1000000012_S0000156	DUDE!
POD1000000012_S0000158	SO LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN FOR A MINUTE.
POD1000000012_S0000159	YEAH.
POD1000000012_S0000160	WHAT DOES NOT EATING COOKIES HAVE TO DO WITH BEING SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL OR IN YOUR LIFE?
POD1000000012_S0000161	ROSEMARY EXPLAINED THAT SELF REGULATION ISN'T JUST ABOUT TREATS. SELF REGULATION IS A SET OF SKILLS THAT HELPS US REACH OUR GOALS.
POD1000000012_S0000162	SPECIFICALLY, WE NEED TO EITHER MONITOR OR CHANGE OR REDIRECT OUR THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND BEHAVIOR TOWARDS A PARTICULAR GOAL THAT WE'VE CHOSEN.
POD1000000012_S0000163	YEAH, AND WITHIN SELF REGULATION, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR US TALK A LOT IN THIS EPISODE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SELF CONTROL, WHICH IS EITHER RESISTING AN IMPULSE OR OVERCOMING A TEMPTATION ON THE WAY TO A GOAL.
POD1000000012_S0000164	SO SELF CONTROL MEANS MORE THAN RESISTING A COOKIE.
POD1000000012_S0000165	IT MEANS NOT HITTING A CLASSMATE ON THE PLAYGROUND WHEN HE TAKES YOUR TRICYCLE.
POD1000000012_S0000166	IT MEANS WORKING THROUGH YOUR MATH HOMEWORK AND NOT THROWING A TANTRUM WHEN YOU GET STUMPED.
POD1000000012_S0000167	YEAH, IT CAN EVEN MEAN WORKING THROUGH A BIG FEAR THAT YOU HAVE WHEN IT OVERWHELMS YOU.
POD1000000012_S0000168	AND ALL OF THIS IS A BIG DEAL RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE NEW RESEARCH THAT ROSEMARY REFERENCED, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S JUST MORE AND MORE KIDS OUT THERE WITH DIAGNOSED ISSUES THAT CAN INTERFERE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF REGULATION.
POD1000000012_S0000169	THINGS LIKE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA, ADHD, OR BEING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM.
POD1000000012_S0000170	BUT ALSO, MANY PARENTS, ESPECIALLY PRIVILEGED PARENTS, ARE BASICALLY STEPPING INTO THEIR KIDS' LIVES TO SMOOTH OVER THEIR KIDS' PATHS AND REMOVE ANY SOURCES OF FRUSTRATION REALLY BEFORE THEIR KIDS HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.
POD1000000012_S0000171	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, CORY.
POD1000000012_S0000172	I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY.
POD1000000012_S0000173	I MEAN, I CAN SEE THAT THIS IS VERY WELL MEANING AND A LOT OF PARENTS JUST WANT THE BEST FOR THEIR KIDS IN A REALLY COMPETITIVE WORLD.
POD1000000012_S0000174	BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING ALSO DEPRIVES THEM OF THE NATURAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO LEARN SELF REGULATION ALONG THE WAY.
POD1000000012_S0000175	AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHILDREN'S LIVES RIGHT NOW, THAT THEY ARE BECOMING RISK AVERSE.
POD1000000012_S0000176	THEY WANT EVERYTHING DONE FOR THEM.
POD1000000012_S0000177	AND SO SESAME DECIDED TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT, YOU KNOW, IF COOKIE MONSTER CAN LEARN TO CONTROL HIMSELF, ANYBODY CAN.
POD1000000012_S0000178	BUT I WAS KIND OF SKEPTICAL, COREY. I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF THIS, RIGHT?
POD1000000012_S0000179	BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I SEE THAT MY KIDS AS THEY GROW UP, THEY GET BETTER AT SELF REGULATION. MY TWO YEAR OLD IS NOT AS GOOD AT WAITING AS MY SEVEN YEAR OLD.
POD1000000012_S0000180	THAT'S RIGHT.
POD1000000012_S0000181	SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST REALLY SOMETHING I NEED TO COACH MY KIDS ON IS LIKE DO I JUST SEND THEM TO SELF CONTROL SUMMER CAMP?
POD1000000012_S0000183	YES AND NO.
POD1000000012_S0000184	SOME OF THE VARIATION IS GENETIC, AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT CHILDREN'S BRAINS DO NATURALLY DEVELOP ALONG THESE LINES.
POD1000000012_S0000185	BUT KEN FUJITA, WHO WE HEARD FROM EARLIER, WHO SAID COOKIE MONSTER WAS A MANIAC...
POD1000000012_S0000186	YET.
POD1000000012_S0000187	HE HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AND HE DESCRIBES IT THIS WAY.
POD1000000012_S0000188	SO THE BRAIN, YOU CAN THINK OF AS BEING LIKE THE HARDWARE.
POD1000000012_S0000189	BUT EVEN WHEN WE HAVE THE HARDWARE, WE STILL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE HARDWARE WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE.
POD1000000012_S0000190	SO BY SOFTWARE, KEN'S TALKING ABOUT THE SKILLS AND THE STRATEGIES THAT PARENTS CAN HELP KIDS PRACTICE TO IMPROVE THEIR SELF REGULATION.
POD1000000012_S0000191	EXACTLY.
POD1000000012_S0000192	AND THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH SUPPORTING VERY SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS. SO WITHOUT MAKING EVERYBODY WAIT ANY LONGER, LET'S OPEN UP THE TOOLBOX AND GET RIGHT TO OUR TAKEAWAYS.
POD1000000012_S0000194	ALRIGHT, AND TAKEAWAY NUMBER ONE IS BIG PICTURE ADVICE FOR US PARENTS.
POD1000000012_S0000196	WE NEED TO START THINKING OF SELF REGULATION AS A SKILL TO BE PRACTICED.
POD1000000012_S0000197	EXACTLY.
POD1000000012_S0000198	SO THIS PART MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS TEACHING OUR OLDER DAUGHTER LULU TO SKI, RIGHT?
POD1000000012_S0000199	SO FIRST, SHE WAS KIND OF FREAKED OUT. THE MOUNTAIN IS BIG.
POD1000000012_S0000200	SHE IS SMALL, IT IS COLD.
POD1000000012_S0000201	AND HE HAD TO BEGIN BY REALLY ACKNOWLEDGING ALL OF THE BIG FEELINGS THAT SHE WAS HAVING. AND ROSEMARY SAYS WE SHOULD DO THE SAME THING WHEN WE'RE WORKING ON A SKILL.
POD1000000012_S0000202	YOU NEED TO VALIDATE CHILDREN'S EMOTIONS. I KNOW IT'S HARD.
POD1000000012_S0000203	I KNOW IT'S HARD. THE WORST THING TO BE IS LIKE, YOU KNOW, OH, IT'S EASY. DON'T WORRY. AND SO, NO.
POD1000000012_S0000204	SO YOU'VE DONE THAT EMPATHIZING, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS.
POD1000000012_S0000205	WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO? YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T JUST TELL THE KID, SKI DOWN THE HILL, AND YOU DON'T JUST TELL A KID, CONTROL YOURSELF.
POD1000000012_S0000206	YEAH, DON'T... DON'T THROW A TANTRUM.
POD1000000012_S0000207	RIGHT
POD1000000012_S0000208	THAT DOESN'T WORK. YOU CAN'T DO IT THAT WAY.
POD1000000012_S0000209	SO WHEN YOU'RE SKIING, YOU BREAK DOWN THE SKILL INTO TINY PIECES AND THERE ARE STRATEGIES THAT YOU CAN USE FOR EACH ONE.
POD1000000012_S0000210	FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN, YOU POINT THE SKIS TOWARDS EACH OTHER. AND THE CODE WORD FOR THAT IS PIZZA.
POD1000000012_S0000211	LIKE IT'S A SLICE OF PIZZA, THE TWO SKIS COMING TOGETHER.
POD1000000012_S0000212	THANK YOU, LIFE KIT SKIING!
POD1000000012_S0000213	YES. NOW, THE ANALOGY HERE IS WE'RE TAKING SELF REGULATION OR SELF CONTROL, THESE BIG, BIG CONCEPTS, AND WE'RE BREAKING THEM DOWN INTO VERY SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT WE WANT OUR KIDS TO TRY.
POD1000000012_S0000214	RIGHT. AND THE OTHER KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO FAIL AND PROBABLY FAIL A LOT.
POD1000000012_S0000215	YEAH.
POD1000000012_S0000216	BEFORE THEY SUCCEED. AND WE REALLY HAVE TO NOT ONLY ACCEPT THAT FAILURE, BUT PRAISE THEIR EFFORT EVERY CHANCE WE GET.
POD1000000012_S0000217	SO EVEN IF IT IS, I JUST WAITED A MINUTE. PRAISE THE EFFORT. I WAITED A MINUTE.
POD1000000012_S0000218	YEAH, AND NEXT TIME, MAYBE THEY'LL WAIT TWO MINUTES.
POD1000000012_S0000219	TOTALLY. AND HERE'S THE THING. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERY KID NEEDS TO LEARN TO SKI, BUT EVERY KID NEEDS TO LEARN TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS.
POD1000000012_S0000220	AND THEY CAN, AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A COACH.
POD1000000012_S0000221	YEAH, SO LET'S LOOK AT SELF CONTROL AGAIN. WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP TO NOT HITTING YOUR FRIEND OR NOT THROWING YOUR HOMEWORK ACROSS THE ROOM?
POD1000000012_S0000222	TYING YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK?
POD1000000012_S0000224	A BETTER WAY IS NOT GETTING SO MAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.
POD1000000012_S0000225	AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO START HERE WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHING OUR KIDS TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS. BECAUSE IT'S SELF REGULATION, RIGHT?
POD1000000012_S0000226	SO, TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO, YELLING CALM DOWN AT YOUR KIDS WHEN THEY GET REALLY WORKED UP, THAT DOESN'T WORK.
POD1000000012_S0000227	YEAH, I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE TRIED IT.
POD1000000012_S0000229	I HAVE TRIED IT TOO MANY TIMES.
POD1000000012_S0000230	I MEAN, IT'S JUST REALLY COMMON TO RESPOND TO OUR KIDS' FRUSTRATION WITH OUR OWN FRUSTRATION.
POD1000000012_S0000231	BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP BOTH OF US AS LONG AS WE'RE CONSISTENT, BOTH OUR KIDS AND OURSELVES, AND THAT IS OUR SLOW, DEEP BREATHING.
POD1000000012_S0000232	BELLY BREATHING COMES IN. SO TAKING THOSE DEEP SLOW BREATHS IN AND OUT.
POD1000000012_S0000234	JUST LIKE I DID WITH COOKIE MONSTER. I KNOW IT WAS SILLY AND PROBABLY SOUNDED A LITTLE RIDICULOUS,
POD1000000012_S0000235	BUT IT WORKS. I DO IT AT HOME. I DO IT AT WORK
POD1000000012_S0000236	YOU CAN ASK ALL OF THE LIFEKIT PRODUCERS. IT WORKS.
POD1000000012_S0000237	AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT A HABIT.
POD1000000012_S0000238	AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S NOT ALL, CORY.
POD1000000012_S0000239	YOU CAN TEACH YOUR KID TO HUG A PILLOW OR A STUFFED ANIMAL TO CALM DOWN. YOU CAN ALSO TRY THIS CRAFT.
POD1000000012_S0000240	OKAY, TAKE A JAR, FILL IT WITH GLUE, WATER, AND GLITTER.
POD1000000012_S0000241	AND THEN MAKE SURE YOU SCREW THE LID ON REALLY TIGHT. THAT'S IMPORTANT.
POD1000000012_S0000243	AND WHENEVER THEY'RE FEELING STRESSED OUT, YOU CAN TELL YOUR KIDS TO GIVE THAT JAR A SHAKE.
POD1000000012_S0000244	I KNOW I'M OVERWHELMED RIGHT NOW, BUT LET ME JUST BREATHE AND FOCUS ON HOW THAT GLITTER IS SWIRLING AROUND, WHICH REPRESENTS MY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW.
POD1000000012_S0000245	BUT IF I BELLY BREATHE AND WATCH THE GLITTER SETTLE, IT GIVES ME THE TIME TO CALM DOWN.
POD1000000012_S0000247	ALRIGHT, SO BELLY BREATHING, GLITTER JARS, OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY ZEROES IN VERY SPECIFICALLY ON SELF CONTROL.
POD1000000012_S0000248	THAT'S RIGHT, TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE. PRETEND THE COOKIE IS PLASTIC.
POD1000000012_S0000250	ALRIGHT, SO YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE MARSHMALLOW TEST.
POD1000000012_S0000251	IT WAS A FAMOUS STUDY THAT WAS DONE WHERE CHILDREN WERE OFFERED A MARSHMALLOW TO EAT.
POD1000000012_S0000252	AND THEY WERE TOLD THEY COULD EAT IT RIGHT AWAY, BUT IF THEY WAITED, THEY COULD HAVE TWO OF THE TREATS LATER.
POD1000000012_S0000253	YEAH, SO THIS STUDY IS SO FAMOUS, IF YOU JUST GO TO YOUTUBE AND TYPE IN MARSHMALLOW TEST, YOU'LL FIND ALL KINDS OF VIDEOS OF KIDS BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS SORT OF TORMENT.
POD1000000012_S0000254	I'M GONNA GO DO SOMETHING AND THEN I'LL COME BACK.
POD1000000012_S0000255	IT SMELLS YUMMY.
POD1000000012_S0000257	IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD.
POD1000000012_S0000258	THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN REPEATED MANY, MANY TIMES SINCE IT WAS FIRST DONE BY WALTER MISCHEL IN THE LATE 1960S.
POD1000000012_S0000259	AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONTROVERSY OVER WHAT IT EXACTLY PROVED, ESPECIALLY WITH SOME OF THE LONG TERM OUTCOMES AND WHEN YOU TAKE FACTORS LIKE SOCIAL CLASS INTO CONSIDERATION.
POD1000000012_S0000260	YES, ABSOLUTELY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THAT BASIC EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH KIDS AND TREATS AND A TIMER
POD1000000012_S0000261	IT'S A REALLY GOOD CONTEXT TO SEE THE STRATEGIES THAT CHILDREN CAN AND DO USE WHEN THEIR SELF CONTROL IS BEING TESTED.
POD1000000012_S0000262	WHAT SEEMS TO LEAD KIDS TO BE TEMPTED BY THE SMALLER IMMEDIATE REWARD, THE ONE MARSHMALLOW, IS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT IN A HOT WAY.
POD1000000012_S0000263	AND BY HOT, KEN FUJITA MEANS INTENSE OR URGENT, SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO ACT ON RIGHT NOW. BUT, HE SAYS,
POD1000000012_S0000264	IF KIDS COULD FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOL THEIR THOUGHTS, THEY WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO WAIT OUT THE DELAY.
POD1000000012_S0000265	AND THAT KNOWING THESE STRATEGIES SEEMED TO PREDICT WHICH KIDS WERE ABLE TO DELAY AND WHICH ONES WERE NOT.
POD1000000012_S0000266	FOR EXAMPLE, KIDS PRETENDED THE MARSHMALLOWS WERE JUST PUFFY CLOUDS, OR THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE MARSHMALLOWS THROUGH A PICTURE FRAME.
POD1000000012_S0000267	WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS QUERY IS THAT KIDS ARE USING A STRENGTH, THEIR IMAGINATIONS, TO OVERCOME THEIR WEAKNESS IN SELF CONTROL OR DELAYING GRATIFICATION.
POD1000000012_S0000268	AND ROSEMARY TOLD US THAT PRACTICING THESE STRATEGIES AND LEARNING ABOUT THEM CAN BE REALLY EMPOWERING AND ACTUALLY THERAPEUTIC, ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS WHO STRUGGLE WITH SELF REGULATION.
POD1000000012_S0000269	YEAH, AND ALL THE EXPERTS TOLD US IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PRACTICE NOT ONLY HAPPEN IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS, BUT YOU REALLY LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR IT SO THAT WHEN THOSE HOT FEELINGS ARISE, THEY TURN TO THE STRATEGY AND USE IT.
POD1000000012_S0000270	SO YOU PLANT IT AND THEN IT PAYS OFF.
POD1000000012_S0000271	AND THEN IT PAYS OFF LATER, EXACTLY.
POD1000000012_S0000273	NOW, TAKE AWAY NUMBER FOUR, SPEAKING OF IMAGINATION, THIS IS MY FAVORITE TAKE AWAY.
POD1000000012_S0000275	I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE. WHAT WOULD BATMAN DO?
POD1000000012_S0000276	YEAH, KEN VEGETA TOLD US ABOUT A FASCINATING STUDY.
POD1000000012_S0000277	IT'S A VARIATION ON THE MARSHMALLOW TEST, WHERE RESEARCHERS ASKED KIDS TO DO A VERY BORING TASK WHILE THEY WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY TEMPTED TO PLAY A FUN VIDEO GAME AT THE SAME TIME.
POD1000000012_S0000278	BUT THEN...
POD1000000012_S0000279	THEY ASKED KIDS TO IDENTIFY THEIR FAVORITE SUPERHERO.
POD1000000012_S0000280	AND THIS IS SO NEAT, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE, RIGHT?
POD1000000012_S0000281	BUT THE CHARACTERS, LIKE SUPERHEROES OR PRINCESSES, THEY'RE SO POWERFUL FOR KIDS WHOSE SELF IMAGES ARE REALLY JUST STARTING TO FORM.
POD1000000012_S0000282	SO IF KIDS SAID BATMAN, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY WOULD GET A BATMAN MASK AND A BATMAN CAPE.
POD1000000012_S0000283	I'M BATMAN ING!
POD1000000012_S0000285	AND THEN THE KIDS WERE TOLD WHILE THEY WERE WAITING OUT THE DELAY, THEY SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION, WHAT WOULD BATMAN DO?
POD1000000012_S0000286	AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS REALLY STARTLING.
POD1000000012_S0000287	SO THE KIDS WHO WERE CHANNELING THEIR HEROES WERE MUCH MORE ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION.
POD1000000012_S0000288	I LOVE THIS AND I AM TOTALLY GOING TO USE THIS ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE FOR ME IT WOULDN'T BE THE NORMAL BAP IT WOULD BE LIKE
POD1000000012_S0000290	COREY, LOOK OVER THERE! IT'S A BRIGHT SH
POD1000000012_S0000292	WHAT?
POD1000000012_S0000294	OH, I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE. NICE, NICE KAMENETZ.
POD1000000012_S0000296	TAKEAWAY NUMBER FIVE, BE SMART ABOUT DISTRACTIONS.
POD1000000012_S0000297	GETTING OUT OF A HOT MOMENT SOMETIMES CAN TAKE DISTRACTION, JUST LIKE WHEN YOU ASK COOKIE MONSTER ABOUT HIS TASTE IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE.
POD1000000012_S0000298	RIGHT, OR LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAR WITH YOUR KIDS AND SUDDENLY THEY TRANSITION FROM, ARE WE THERE YET? TO, MOM, HE'S HITTING ME. DAD, HE'S HITTING ME.
POD1000000012_S0000299	THAT IS THE PERFECT TIME TO RESORT TO A DISTRACTION LIKE TRAVEL BINGO OR THE LICENSE PLATE GAME.
POD1000000012_S0000300	I'M GOING TO TAKE MY ATTENTION OFF OF THIS TREAT AND PLACE MY ATTENTION ON SOMETHING ELSE. SO I'M GOING TO GO PLAY WITH SOMETHING ELSE.
POD1000000012_S0000301	RIGHT. AND EVERY PARENT KNOWS, LIKE ROSEMARY SAYS, YOU NEED TO HAVE A LONG LIST OF POTENTIAL DISTRACTIONS UP YOUR SLEEVE, RIGHT?
POD1000000012_S0000302	IT COULD BE READING IT COULD BE SINGING.
POD1000000012_S0000303	IT COULD BE DABBING!
POD1000000012_S0000304	IT COULD BE DRAWING.
POD1000000012_S0000305	OR FLOSSING?
POD1000000012_S0000306	YOU MEAN LIKE DENTAL CARE?
POD1000000012_S0000307	NO, NO, I MEAN LIKE
POD1000000012_S0000309	YOU MEAN LIKE FORTNITE CARE? YEAH, GOTCHA.
POD1000000012_S0000310	OR I DON'T KNOW, YOUTUBE BEING A MILLION DIFFERENT VIDEOS OF LEGO BATMAN RAPPING WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING A PODCAST SCRIPT.
POD1000000012_S0000311	THAT'S A GOOD DISTRACTION.
POD1000000012_S0000312	WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THAT. AND SPEAKING OF DISTRACTIONS.
POD1000000012_S0000314	FLIP SIDE HERE.
POD1000000012_S0000316	REMOVING DISTRACTIONS CAN ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SET YOUR KIDS UP FOR SUCCESS WHEN IT COMES TO SELF CARE.
POD1000000012_S0000318	FRANKLY, YOUR CO HOST.
POD1000000012_S0000320	FOR YOUR CO HOST.
POD1000000012_S0000321	SO THE IDEA HERE IS REMOVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FRUSTRATION, RIGHT? SO MAYBE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING ON THEIR HOMEWORK, YOU KEEP THE VIDEO GAMES OUT OF SIGHT.
POD1000000012_S0000322	OR MAYBE YOU DON'T KEEP THE COOKIE JAR ON THE COUNTER. INSTEAD, YOU GO OUT FOR ICE CREAM ONCE A WEEK.
POD1000000012_S0000323	YEAH, AND YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO BUILD SELF CONTROL.
POD1000000012_S0000324	BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT IN A REALLY AGE APPROPRIATE WAY. YOU DON'T WANT TO EXHAUST THEM BY TESTING THEIR SELF CONTROL CONSTANTLY.
POD1000000012_S0000325	AND YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO SET UNREALISTIC GOALS THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO.
POD1000000012_S0000326	AND THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH THIS. OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX IS THE WORLD IS ALREADY FULL OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD SELF REGULATION SKILLS.
POD1000000012_S0000327	SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EXPLICIT STRATEGIES, MOSTLY FOR SELF CONTROL. BUT RESEARCHERS ARE ALSO BACKING UP SOMETHING THAT PARENTS AND EDUCATORS HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.
POD1000000012_S0000328	YEAH, THERE ARE SO MANY EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES THAT CAN BUILD THIS BROADER SET OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND SELF REGULATION SKILLS.
POD1000000012_S0000329	KEN FUJITA SAYS FOR HIM, ONE AREA WAS MUSIC.
POD1000000012_S0000330	I ATTENDED MUSIC SCHOOLS, I PLAYED VIOLIN AND PIANO.
POD1000000012_S0000332	DID HE LOVE TO PRACTICE? NO.
POD1000000012_S0000333	NOBODY WANTS TO PRACTICE. PRACTICING IS VERY TEDIOUS.
POD1000000012_S0000334	NOBODY LIKES TO RECEIVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, RIGHT?
POD1000000012_S0000335	BUT RESPONDING CONSTRUCTIVELY TO NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, TO ENDURING THE DRUDGERY OF EVERYDAY PRACTICING, THESE ALL REQUIRE SELF CONTROL.
POD1000000012_S0000336	ANOTHER ACTIVITY THAT EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN TO IMPROVE SELF REGULATION IS MARTIAL ARTS.
POD1000000012_S0000337	I'M ALSO A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR. I PRACTICE THE JAPANESE MARTIAL ART KENDO, SWORD FIGHTING.
POD1000000012_S0000338	AND I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT WATCHING CHILDREN TRANSFORM IN FRONT OF MY EYES. SOME OF THEM COME IN VERY UNDISCIPLINED.
POD1000000012_S0000339	BUT, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF YEARS OF REALLY HARD, INTENSE TRAINING AND PRACTICE AND COMMITMENT, THEY LEARN THE VALUE OF DELAYING GRATIFICATION.
POD1000000012_S0000340	ANYA, I JUST HAVE TO SAY FOR THE RECORD, FORGET WHAT WOULD BATMAN DO. FROM NOW ON, I'M ASKING MYSELF, WHAT WOULD KEN FUJITA DO?
POD1000000012_S0000341	TOTALLY.
POD1000000012_S0000342	AND LET'S ALSO ADD TO THE LIST OF MARTIAL ARTS, LEARNING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, PRACTICING YOGA.
POD1000000012_S0000343	YEP.
POD1000000012_S0000344	DEFINITELY PROVEN STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING SELF REGULATION SKILLS.
POD1000000012_S0000346	OKAY, YOU GUYS, COOKIE HAS BEEN WAITING ALL THIS TIME.
POD1000000012_S0000348	YEAH, REMEMBER THE TOP OF THE EPISODE COREY LAUGHED ALLEGEDLY TO GET MILK?
POD1000000012_S0000349	WE'VE BEEN SITTING IN A DIFFERENT STUDIO RECORDING THIS WHOLE PODCAST.
POD1000000012_S0000350	I LEFT HIM HANGING. HE'S PRACTICING HIS STRATEGIES.
POD1000000012_S0000351	I HOPE HE'S
POD1000000012_S0000354	STRATEGY
POD1000000012_S0000355	I HOPE SO TOO. SO I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO IN THERE AND SAY HI.
POD1000000012_S0000356	OH, AND I STILL NEED TO GET THE MILK.

POD1000000012_S0000391	IT'S FOR US PARENTS. START LOOKING AT SELF REGULATION AS A SKILL TO BE PRACTICED.
POD1000000012_S0000392	YEAH, LEARNING SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS IS LIKE LEARNING TO PLAY BASEBALL OR TO SKI.
POD1000000012_S0000393	ONLY MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

POD1000000012_S0000404	AND DON'T JUST DO IT ONCE OR TWICE, MAKE IT A HABIT.
POD1000000012_S0000405	TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE, PRETEND A COOKIE, IS PLASTIC.

POD1000000013_S0000006	WE LIKE TO START EACH EPISODE OF RADIO OMBUDSMAN BY HEARING A BIT ABOUT OUR GUESTS IN TERMS OF THEIR BACKGROUND.
POD1000000013_S0000007	WHERE WERE YOU BORN FOR EXAMPLE AND BROUGHT UP?
POD1000000013_S0000008	WHAT KIND OF VALUES DO YOU REMEMBER BEING IMBIBED WITH EARLY ON?
POD1000000013_S0000009	WELL, THANK YOU, ROB, AND THANK YOU FOR THE KIND INTRODUCTION.
POD1000000013_S0000010	AND IT'S GREAT TO BE ON THIS INNOVATIVE PROGRAM, RADIO OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000013_S0000011	WHERE WAS I BORN? I WAS BORN IN BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND.
POD1000000013_S0000012	I WAS BORN INTO A LARGE FAMILY. I WAS THE YOUNGEST OF A FAMILY OF SIX.
POD1000000013_S0000013	WEST BELFAST IN THE 1960S WHEN I WAS BORN WAS A PLACE OF MUCH TURMOIL.
POD1000000013_S0000014	AND MY EARLY
POD1000000013_S0000016	EARLY CHILDHOOD ADULT LIFE AND INTO MY TIME AT UNIVERSITY WAS VERY MUCH A TIME OF CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND.
POD1000000013_S0000017	I CAME FROM A VERY RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND WHERE VALUES WERE VERY IMPORTANT.
POD1000000013_S0000018	SO THERE WAS A WILLINGNESS AND A DESIRE ON THE PART OF MY MUM AND DAD TO BRING US UP REGARDLESS, TO RESPECT EVERYBODY AND TO RESPECT EVERYONE'S VIEWS AND RELIGION.
POD1000000013_S0000020	THAT'S INTERESTING AND THAT REALLY ANTICIPATES THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT DO YOU LEARN AND TAKE FROM THOSE AWFUL SITUATIONS?
POD1000000013_S0000021	THE NEED FOR FAIRNESS IS VERY IMPORTANT, PART OF COMMUNITIES GETTING ON TOGETHER.
POD1000000013_S0000022	IF ONE COMMUNITY FEELS THEY'VE BEEN DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY, OR INDEED ONE INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS, THAT THAT IS POTENTIALLY DESTABILISING FOR SOCIETY AND FOR THAT COMMUNITY.
POD1000000013_S0000023	SO I REALISED VERY EARLY ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS PROBABLY PART OF MY NATURE, WHICH IS THIS DESIRE FOR FAIRNESS.
POD1000000013_S0000025	DOES THAT EXPLAIN WHY YOU TOOK A LAW DEGREE?
POD1000000013_S0000026	IN PART. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT OPENLY IS THE FACT THAT I WAS IN A CONVENT SCHOOL.
POD1000000013_S0000027	AND I WAS, THERE WAS A PARTICULAR DAY I WAS CALLED OUT AT ASSEMBLY.
POD1000000013_S0000028	I WAS 12, 13 AND I WAS HUGELY HUMILIATED AND EMBARRASSED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS BEING ACCUSED OF STEALING ANOTHER GIRL'S GYM SHOES WHEN I HADN'T.
POD1000000013_S0000029	IT WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT MISTAKE CAME OUT, BUT I REMEMBER THAT FEELING.
POD1000000013_S0000030	I THINK THAT WAS THE MORE CATHARTIC MOMENT, IF YOU LIKE, THE FEELING OF, IT'S NOT, I WAS ON MY OWN.
POD1000000013_S0000031	AND I WAS DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY AND I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO HELP PEOPLE THAT WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY.
POD1000000013_S0000032	SO THAT'S WHAT MADE ME WANT TO BE A LAWYER REALLY.
POD1000000013_S0000033	YEAH, OKAY.
POD1000000013_S0000034	AND AFTER UNIVERSITY, I KNOW YOU BECAME A SOLICITOR, BUT WAS THAT STRAIGHT AWAY?
POD1000000013_S0000035	YES, YES, I DIDN'T. I KNOW NOWADAYS THERE'S A GAP HERE.
POD1000000013_S0000036	BUT YES, I WENT TO THE INSTITUTE OF LEGAL STUDIES AND PRACTICED AS A SOLICITOR IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND THEN IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.
POD1000000013_S0000037	MOSTLY LITIGATION, BUT STARTED TO FOCUS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND DATA PROTECTION, FREEDOM OF INFORMATION WHEN I WAS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.
POD1000000013_S0000038	SO WHEN DID YOU JOIN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE?
POD1000000013_S0000039	2003.
POD1000000013_S0000040	OKAY, AND WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THEN?
POD1000000013_S0000041	BEFORE THEN I WORKED FOR THE HOUSING AUTHORITY.
POD1000000013_S0000042	I WORKED FOR 17 YEARS IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY DEALING WITH INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS SUCH AS ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR, HOMELESSNESS, FRACTURED COMMUNITIES WHO HAD TO BE HOUSED NEAR TO EACH OTHER.
POD1000000013_S0000043	YEAH.
POD1000000013_S0000044	SO ISSUES SUCH AS PEACE WALLS.
POD1000000013_S0000045	SO IT WAS A GOOD GROUNDING, IF YOU LIKE, FOR DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT I DEAL WITH NOW, BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION.
POD1000000013_S0000046	I RECOGNISE THE NEED FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND FOR PEOPLE'S INFORMATION TO BE PROTECTED.
POD1000000013_S0000047	AND I REALLY, I LOVED MY TIME IN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. I WAS THERE FIVE YEARS.
POD1000000013_S0000048	AND YOU SPENT SOME OF IT IN MANCHESTER WITH
POD1000000013_S0000050	THAT WAS A TREAT.
POD1000000013_S0000051	YES.
POD1000000013_S0000052	PRIVILEGE.
POD1000000013_S0000053	YES.
POD1000000013_S0000054	IT WAS A TIME OF EMERGING FROM THE OFFICE WAS CHANGING FROM BEING THE DATA PROTECTION COMMISSIONER, A KIND OF A REGISTRATION FUNCTION.
POD1000000013_S0000055	AND IT HAD TAKEN ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, WHICH WAS SO EXCITING.
POD1000000013_S0000056	AND IT WAS ABOUT THE OFFICE GETTING GEARED UP FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND INDEED HAVING REGIONAL OFFICES.
POD1000000013_S0000057	AND THE ONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, I ACTUALLY HELPED ESTABLISH THAT OFFICE.
POD1000000013_S0000058	AND WHEN DID YOU BECOME AN OMBUDSMAN?
POD1000000013_S0000059	IN 2009, SO AFTER LEAVING THE ICO, I WENT BACK TO PRIVATE PRACTICE.
POD1000000013_S0000060	I WORKED IN A COMMERCIAL LAW FIRM AND THEN REALISED THAT REALLY WASN'T FOR ME, THAT I WAS MUCH MORE, MY MAIN INTEREST WAS SOCIAL JUSTICE.
POD1000000013_S0000061	SO I SAW THE ROLE OF DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN AND I THOUGHT THAT'S INTERESTING. I THINK I'LL PUT MY HAT IN THE RING FOR THAT.
POD1000000013_S0000062	AND YEAH I WAS LUCKY I GOT THE JOB.
POD1000000013_S0000063	AND YOU WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK FOR THE LEGENDARY TOM FRAWLEY.
POD1000000013_S0000064	DR. FROHLEY, YEAH, HE'S BEEN A HUGE SUPPORT TO ME THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AND A MENTOR.
POD1000000013_S0000065	AND YES, LEGENDARY.
POD1000000013_S0000066	WE WERE TALKING EARLIER TODAY ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND HIS FAMOUS PHRASE ON LEADERSHIP IS, I AM THEIR LEADER, WHICH WAY DID THEY GO?
POD1000000013_S0000068	SO IT'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW, TO BE A LEADER YOU NEED TO HAVE FOLLOWERS.
POD1000000013_S0000069	ABSOLUTELY.
POD1000000013_S0000070	OKAY, SO FOR OUR ENGLISH LISTENERS AND FOR THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, NORTHERN IRELAND IS OBVIOUSLY UNIQUE POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY.
POD1000000013_S0000071	BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MANY OF US HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS MUST HAVE IMPACTED ON YOUR WORK AS AN OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000013_S0000072	COULD YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT?
POD1000000013_S0000073	WELL I THINK BECAUSE THE FIRST OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND WAS CREATED IN 1969, SO WE ARE CELEBRATING OUR 50TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR THIS YEAR.
POD1000000013_S0000074	IT WAS CREATED TO DEAL WITH COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, PARTICULARLY IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000013_S0000075	I THINK THAT THE GENESIS OF THE IDEA FOR AN OMBUDSMAN WAS TO BRING FAIRNESS TO THE CITIZEN.
POD1000000013_S0000076	AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY BEEN ALWAYS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE OFFICE.
POD1000000013_S0000077	I MEAN WE FEEL VERY, VERY STRONGLY THAT WE ARE IN THE JUSTICE BUSINESS, THAT IT IS ABOUT BEING FAIR.
POD1000000013_S0000078	AND NOT ONLY BEING FAIR TO COMPLAINANTS OR PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT PUBLIC SERVICES HAVE FAILED THEM, BUT BEING FAIR TO THOSE WHO ARE WRONGLY CRITICISED OR WRONGLY BLAMED.
POD1000000013_S0000079	BECAUSE I THINK THE ROLE OF AN OMBUDSMAN IS ALSO TO PROVIDE VINDICATION WHEN THINGS HAVE GONE RIGHT.
POD1000000013_S0000080	WHAT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SECTARIANISM ON YOUR WORK, BOTH INSIDE THE OFFICE AND EXTERNALLY AS OMBUDSMAN?
POD1000000013_S0000081	WELL, I HAVE A WORKFORCE WHO BELIEVE TOTALLY, MY STAFF TOTALLY BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY.
POD1000000013_S0000082	AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO COMPLAINS TO THE OFFICE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO COMPLAINS OR WHAT THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT IS, THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT.
POD1000000013_S0000083	BUT I SUPPOSE WHERE THE AREA WHICH IS MOST CHALLENGING IS IN MY ROLE AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS COMMISSIONER, WHERE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF SECTARIANISM.
POD1000000013_S0000084	BECAUSE I WAS ADJUDICATING ON A PARTICULAR COUNCILLOR FROM A PARTICULAR PART OF THE UNIONIST COMMUNITY.
POD1000000013_S0000085	SO THERE IS THAT ADDED LAYER OF NOT ONLY WANTING TO DO THINGS RIGHT, TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION, BUT BEING AWARE THAT NO MATTER WHAT THAT DECISION IS, IT MIGHT PLEASE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.
POD1000000013_S0000086	SO TO BE ACCUSED OF SECTARIANISM WAS A HUGE HURT FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S NOT PART OF MY VALUES OR MY STAFF VALUES.
POD1000000013_S0000087	I MEAN THAT'S A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOU PERSONALLY.
POD1000000013_S0000088	HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT? BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY RESILIENT, TOUGH PERSON, BUT EVEN THAT MUST BE HARD TO DEAL WITH.
POD1000000013_S0000089	WELL FIRST OF ALL I'VE GOT HUGE SUPPORT FROM MY DEPUTY IN THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM WHO REASSURED ME THAT OF COURSE THIS ISN'T TRUE AND YOU KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE AND WE KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE
POD1000000013_S0000090	BUT I THINK WHAT WAS DIFFICULT WAS THE IMPACT ON MY FAMILY AND HOW THEY FELT
POD1000000013_S0000091	MY HUSBAND WAS ANGRY AND MY CHILDREN WERE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT.
POD1000000013_S0000092	HOW DID IT AFFECT ME? I LEARNED THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF CRITICISM.
POD1000000013_S0000093	AND I LEARNED THAT BEHIND IT ALL YOU'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION.
POD1000000013_S0000094	I CAN REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN I WAS SAVAGELY CRITICISED ON TWITTER.
POD1000000013_S0000095	AND I WAS THIRSTING TO REPLY AND MY OLDER SON SAID TO ME, LEAVE IT ALONE DAD, THEY WANT YOU TO REPLY.
POD1000000013_S0000096	AND I THINK THAT WAS QUITE WISE ADVICE.
POD1000000013_S0000097	SO YOU DO NEED TO CONSULT WITH PEOPLE ON PERSONAL ISSUES, DON'T YOU?
POD1000000013_S0000098	I THINK YOU DO NEED TO CONSULT.
POD1000000013_S0000099	WHAT'S BEEN HELPFUL HAS BEEN PART OF THE OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY'S RESPONSE TO THIS IS THE PERSONAL SUPPORT YOU'VE GIVEN ME, ROB. I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.
POD1000000013_S0000100	I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO OTHERS LIKE THE CURRENT POLICE OMBUDSMAN FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WHO SAID LEAVE IT ALONE.
POD1000000013_S0000101	JUST LEAVE IT BECAUSE IF YOU DO ANYTHING, IF YOU TAKE ANY LEGAL ACTION, THEN IT'S MERELY GOING TO PROVIDE MORE OXYGEN.
POD1000000013_S0000102	YEAH.
POD1000000013_S0000103	DOESN'T STOP IT BEING DIFFICULT
POD1000000013_S0000104	NO.
POD1000000013_S0000105	PERSONALLY DIFFICULT AND THAT'S WHERE THE RESILIENCE COMES IN.
POD1000000013_S0000106	THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP THE NEXT MORNING, GO INTO WORK AND YOUR STAFF HAVE GOT TO SEE THAT A LOW MIGHT AFFECT YOU INSIDE.
POD1000000013_S0000107	THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE OFFICE AND DO THE JOB.
POD1000000013_S0000108	THANK YOU, THAT'S IMPORTANT.
POD1000000013_S0000109	LET'S JUST MOVE THAT ON A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN RELATION TO THE ACTIONS OF PUBLIC SERVICES.
POD1000000013_S0000110	YOU LAUNCHED A BRILLIANT HUMAN RIGHTS MANUAL WHICH SETS OUT AN APPROACH THAT MANY OMBUDSMEN IN EUROPE TAKE.
POD1000000013_S0000111	BUT IS NOT PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, ABOUT ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN BY AN OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000013_S0000112	COULD YOU TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU CREATED THIS?
POD1000000013_S0000113	WELL, IT WAS CREATED JOINTLY WITH THE NORTHERN IRELAND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND IT STARTED AS EVER, AS ALL GOOD IDEAS, WITH A CONVERSATION.
POD1000000013_S0000114	AND IT WAS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND OUR OFFICE AROUND THE SORT OF CASEWORK THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH.
POD1000000013_S0000115	WE WERE DEALING WITH ISSUES LIKE THE ROMA COMMUNITY FEELING DISCRIMINATED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES.
POD1000000013_S0000116	WE'RE DEALING WITH ISSUES OF CONSENT, PATIENTS NOT GIVING CONSENT TO INTERVENTIONS AND THE FAMILY AND THE PATIENT FEELING EXCLUDED FROM THE DECISION MAKING.
POD1000000013_S0000117	BUT ALSO WE REALISED THAT OMBUDSMAN AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONS AND OR EQUALITY BODIES ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE SAME JOB.
POD1000000013_S0000118	SO MY STYLE IS TO MOVE ON FROM THE CONVERSATION AND ACTUALLY HAVE A PRODUCT.
POD1000000013_S0000119	AND THE PRODUCT WAS HOW TO DO THIS MANUAL FOR OMBUDSMAN STAFF.
POD1000000013_S0000120	HOW TO INTRODUCE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES INTO OMBUDSMAN INVESTIGATIONS.
POD1000000013_S0000121	AND IT'S QUITE SIMPLE AND IT'S NOT ABOUT STRASBOURG JURISPRUDENCE.
POD1000000013_S0000122	THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT I THINK FOR NON LAWYERS, FOR NON LEGAL STAFF, THAT THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPLES.
POD1000000013_S0000123	PARTICIPATION, A PERSON AFFECTED BY A DECISION BY WHATEVER PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDER, BE IT HEALTH, BE IT HOUSING, BE IT LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THAT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE.
POD1000000013_S0000124	THEY HAVE TO BE GIVEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO PARTICIPATE EFFECTIVELY IN THE DECISION MAKING.
POD1000000013_S0000125	SO THERE'S THE PRINCIPLE OF EMPOWERMENT, GIVING INFORMATION.
POD1000000013_S0000126	THERE'S THE PRINCIPLE OF NON DISCRIMINATION AND BEING TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY AND HAVING EQUAL ACCESS.
POD1000000013_S0000127	AND ULTIMATELY THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE OMBUDSMEN DO.
POD1000000013_S0000128	WE HOLD PUBLIC SERVICES TO ACCOUNT.
POD1000000013_S0000129	AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD PUBLIC SERVICES MORE TO ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF HAVING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH?
POD1000000013_S0000130	YES, I THINK MALADMINISTRATION IS A TOOL.
POD1000000013_S0000131	BUT I THINK THAT HAVING A HUMAN RIGHTS LENS ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT A WAY SO MUCH FROM THE PROCESS AS TO HOW THE PROCESS ACTUALLY AFFECTS THE INDIVIDUALS AND AFFECTS THE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS.
POD1000000013_S0000132	SO TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, WE HAD A CASE WHERE A YOUNG MAN DIED AS A RESULT OF A ROUTINE EAR OPERATION.
POD1000000013_S0000133	AND IT WAS A ONE IN A MILLION REACTION TO A TITANIUM IMPLANT, TO THE PACKING AROUND A TITANIUM IMPLANT.
POD1000000013_S0000134	THE POINT BEING HIS MUM AND DAD BELIEVED THAT HE WASN'T CONSENTED FOR THAT INTERVENTION.
POD1000000013_S0000135	AND THAT THAT WAS UNFAIR AND AFFECTED HIS HUMAN RIGHTS.
POD1000000013_S0000136	THE CORONER HAD REFUSED TO UNDERTAKE AN INQUEST SAYING IT DIDN'T AFFECT HIS HUMAN RIGHTS.
POD1000000013_S0000137	WHEN IT CAME TO MY OFFICE, WE IDENTIFIED THE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE OF PARTICIPATION.
POD1000000013_S0000138	IF I KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME, IF I'M TOLD OF THE RISKS, INSTEAD OF SOMEONE ELSE MAKING THE DECISION FOR ME, THEN MY HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN RESPECTED.
POD1000000013_S0000139	WHEN I DREW THAT OUT IN THE INVESTIGATION REPORT, I WAS ABLE TO COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EXPERTS
POD1000000013_S0000140	SOME SAID, WELL, ANOTHER CONSULTANT MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE THE IMPLANT. ANOTHER SAID THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AHEAD WITH THE IMPLANT.
POD1000000013_S0000141	BUT ACTUALLY, THE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH MEANT THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL AND THAT THEY HADN'T BEEN PROPERLY CONSENTED.
POD1000000013_S0000142	THE RESULT, NOT ONLY DID THE FAMILY GET AN INVESTIGATION REPORT IDENTIFYING THIS ISSUE, BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO GO TO THE CORONER.
POD1000000013_S0000143	HE'S COMMENCED AN INQUEST.
POD1000000013_S0000144	NOW, YOU HAVE TWO THINGS IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT WE DON'T HAVE. YOU HAVE...
POD1000000013_S0000145	PARTLY BECAUSE OF YOUR OWN EXCELLENCE IN BRINGING IT ABOUT. YOU HAVE AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN SCHEME AND YOU HAVE THE POWER OF OWN INITIATIVE.
POD1000000013_S0000146	ARE THESE VALUABLE ADDITIONS TO THE WAY OMBUDSMEN SHOULD BE WORKING?
POD1000000013_S0000147	I DO BELIEVE IN THE ONE STOP SHOP MODEL.
POD1000000013_S0000148	THE PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN IN NORTHERN IRELAND LOOKS AT COMPLAINTS ABOUT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, STATUTORY AGENCIES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE, EDUCATION, SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES,
POD1000000013_S0000149	I THINK THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR STAFF BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY ENJOY THE VARIETY.
POD1000000013_S0000150	BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AN OMBUDSMAN, OMBUDSMAN PRINCIPLES OF GOOD ADMINISTRATION APPLY ACROSS SECTORS.
POD1000000013_S0000151	SO YES, I THINK IT IS OF VALUE.
POD1000000013_S0000152	I THINK HAVING ONE PLACE TO GO TO TO SEEK REDRESS FOR INJUSTICE IS IMPORTANT.
POD1000000013_S0000153	IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO TO COURT, THERE'S AN OMBUDSMAN THERE THAT CAN LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE.
POD1000000013_S0000154	OWN INITIATIVE IS FOR ME AN ESSENTIAL TOOL OF EVERY OMBUDSMAN'S TOOLKIT.
POD1000000013_S0000155	WHEN YOU LOOK INTERNATIONALLY,
POD1000000013_S0000156	YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMAN IN AUSTRALIA, YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMAN IN EUROPE, YOU LOOK AT OMBUDSMAN IN NORTH AMERICA, THE ONTARIO OMBUDSMAN, THE REST WESTERN AUSTRALIAN OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000013_S0000157	THEY ALL HAVE OWN INITIATIVE. THEY'VE ALL HAD OWN INITIATIVE FROM THE START.
POD1000000013_S0000158	THE IRISH OMBUDSMAN ACT THAT WAS CREATED IN 1980 HAD ITS OWN INITIATIVE THERE AS WELL AS DEALING WITH INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINTS.
POD1000000013_S0000159	FOR ME, AN OMBUDSMAN WITHOUT OWN INITIATIVE CAN'T FULFIL THE MANDATE OF IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICES FOR MANY, NOT JUST FOR THE INDIVIDUAL.
POD1000000013_S0000160	SO YOU WOULD HAVE NO HESITATION ABOUT INTRODUCING AN INITIATIVE. IT'S ESSENTIAL.
POD1000000013_S0000161	NOT AT ALL. I WAS LUCKY TO BE PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN ACT.
POD1000000013_S0000162	AND HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERSUADE OFFICIALS WHO WERE PERHAPS NERVOUS ABOUT THE OMBUDSMAN HAVING OWN INITIATIVE POWERS.
POD1000000013_S0000163	THAT REALLY THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY COULD BENEFIT PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE END.
POD1000000013_S0000164	SEE, IT IS ABOUT PREVENTION.
POD1000000013_S0000165	YOU CAN DEAL WITH NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS BUT NEVER GET TO THE CORE ISSUE, WHEREAS OWN INITIATIVE ALLOWS YOU TO TACKLE THE CORE ISSUE OF SYSTEMIC FAILING.
POD1000000013_S0000166	WELL, I AGREE WITH THAT.
POD1000000013_S0000167	AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR US TO HAVE THE REFORM THAT YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN OPERATING FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS NOW.
POD1000000013_S0000168	YES, AND NOW THE WELSH OMBUDSMAN IS ABOUT TO GET THAT ALSO.
POD1000000013_S0000169	I BELIEVE SCOTTISH OMBUDSMAN WOULD LIKE TO OWN INITIATIVE.
POD1000000013_S0000170	SO IF THAT HAPPENS, IT MEANS THAT THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE IT.
POD1000000013_S0000171	AND THE FIRST EVER OMBUDSMAN IN THESE ISLANDS, THE PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMAN, HAS NOT.
POD1000000013_S0000172	AND I THINK THAT'S MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE CITIZEN.
POD1000000013_S0000173	AS YOU MOVE ON FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN, WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF?
POD1000000013_S0000174	IS IT BRINGING THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER, THE INTEGRATION OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS?
POD1000000013_S0000175	WELL I THINK THE LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWED THE PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN AS A ONE STOP SHOP FOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICES
POD1000000013_S0000176	BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO BRING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS.
POD1000000013_S0000177	BECAUSE NORTHERN IRELAND, WHICH WAS THE ONLY PART IN EUROPE, DIDN'T HAVE A MANDATORY CODE OF CONDUCT FOR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES.
POD1000000013_S0000178	THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN 2014.
POD1000000013_S0000179	AND MY OFFICE AND I AS DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN, NOW OMBUDSMAN, HAVE BEEN KEY TO ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATIVE AND JUDICATIVE FUNCTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND.
POD1000000013_S0000180	THAT IS A UNIQUE MODEL BUT I BELIEVE OPERATES VERY WELL.
POD1000000013_S0000181	THAT IS NOT WORK THAT IS OUTWITH OMBUDSMANRY.
POD1000000013_S0000182	BECAUSE FOR ME ETHICAL STANDARDS, VALUES, FAIRNESS, THEY'RE ALL PART OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE OMBUDSMEN ARE.
POD1000000013_S0000183	I MEAN, WE'RE NOT A COURT. WE DON'T DECLARE, DON'T MAKE BINDING DECISIONS.
POD1000000013_S0000184	BUT NEVERTHELESS WE CAN INFLUENCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAKE AND WITH SETTING STANDARDS.
POD1000000013_S0000186	NOW, WE ASKED COLLEAGUES ON TWITTER TO SEND IN QUESTIONS.
POD1000000013_S0000187	AND WE HAD A SET OF QUESTIONS FROM ONE DISSATISFIED USER OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR PREDECESSOR, WHO FELT THAT SHE HADN'T BEEN TREATED FAIRLY BY THE SYSTEM.
POD1000000013_S0000188	WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO PEOPLE IN THAT POSITION?
POD1000000013_S0000189	I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000013_S0000190	THEY BELIEVE THAT THE OMBUDSMAN IS THERE PARTICULARLY TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND THEIR PARTICULAR ISSUE.
POD1000000013_S0000191	OMBUDSMEN ARE IMPARTIAL SO A FINDING OF NO FAILURE CAN BE DISAPPOINTING TO A COMPLAINANT.
POD1000000013_S0000192	AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE CASE IN RELATION TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU REFER TO.
POD1000000013_S0000193	OF THE PREVIOUS OMBUDSMAN DID NOT FIND IN HER FAVOUR AND THAT CAN BE DISAPPOINTING.
POD1000000013_S0000194	BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS THAT PERHAPS A CLINICIAN OR A MEMBER OF HEALTH STAFF WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED RECEIVES A MESSAGE THAT ACTUALLY THEY DID IT RIGHT.
POD1000000013_S0000195	BUT THERE ARE MANY OCCASIONS IN WHICH COMPLAINANTS DON'T AGREE WITH MY DECISIONS.
POD1000000013_S0000197	BUT I STILL HAVE TO DECIDE FAIRLY, ENSURE THERE'S A FAIR PROCESS, ENSURE EVERYONE GETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND REPORT ON THE MATTER.
POD1000000013_S0000198	THAT'S WHAT AN OMBUDSMAN DOES.
POD1000000013_S0000199	YES, IT'S DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO EXPLAIN THAT WHILE THE COMPLAINT BELONGS TO THE COMPLAINANT, THE DECISION BELONGS TO THE OMBUDSMAN, PROVIDING IT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND RIGOROUS.
POD1000000013_S0000200	PROVIDED IT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND RIGOROUS BUT ALSO I BELIEVE FAIR.
POD1000000013_S0000201	I THINK YOU HAVE TO GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE CRITICIZED.
POD1000000013_S0000202	BUT THIS ISSUE ABOUT IT'S AN OMBUDSMAN DECISION WHILE YOU BRING YOUR COMPLAINT.
POD1000000013_S0000203	IT IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S DECISION, HAS ACTUALLY BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE LEGISLATION THAT I REFER TO.
POD1000000013_S0000204	WHICH IS THAT UNDER THE NORTHERN IRISH OMBUDSMAN LEGISLATION, THE 2016 ACT, THAT I MENTIONED, THAT EVEN IF A COMPLAINANT WITHDREW THEIR COMPLAINT, I CAN STILL INVESTIGATE.
POD1000000013_S0000205	SO IT IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S INVESTIGATION.
POD1000000013_S0000206	NOW YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE OFFICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND FOR 10 YEARS.
POD1000000013_S0000207	IT'S A LONG TIME. WILL YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS ABOUT...
POD1000000013_S0000208	MOVING ON, EVEN THOUGH IT'S TO AN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING ROLE.
POD1000000013_S0000209	I HAVE HUGE REGRETS ABOUT LEAVING MY STAFF BECAUSE THEY ARE WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH, HUGELY SUPPORTIVE.
POD1000000013_S0000210	AND ON DAYS WHEN I DON'T HAVE MY USUAL LEVEL OF ENERGY, THEY GIVE ME THE ENERGY BACK TO KEEP GOING.
POD1000000013_S0000211	SO I'VE REGRETS ABOUT LEAVING MY STAFF.
POD1000000013_S0000212	BUT I WAS ASKED THIS QUESTION ABOUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO UNDERTAKE THE ROLE OF POLICE OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000013_S0000213	I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE AND IT'S ABOUT BRINGING MY EXPERIENCE
POD1000000013_S0000214	YOU SAID 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE, 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.
POD1000000013_S0000215	IT'S BRINGING THAT TO BEAR IN WHAT IS A VERY CHALLENGING AREA, DEALING WITH POLICE COMPLAINTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.
POD1000000013_S0000216	NOW YOU'VE SPENT THE DAY WITH US SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES AT OUR ALL STAFF AWAY DAY.
POD1000000013_S0000217	WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO OUR YOUNGER COLLEAGUES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE ONLY RECENTLY JOINED THE OMBUDS PROFESSION?
POD1000000013_S0000218	THE ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS FIRST OF ALL IT IS A PROFESSION.
POD1000000013_S0000219	AS YOU KNOW ROB FROM YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ME, I BELIEVE VERY MUCH THAT IT HAS TO BE RECOGNISED AS A PROFESSION.
POD1000000013_S0000220	AND THAT I'M AMAZED AT YOUR ACCREDITATION PROJECT AT GETTING THAT OFF THE GROUND.
POD1000000013_S0000221	I WOULD ADVISE THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS OFFICE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
POD1000000013_S0000222	THAT IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY AND I REALISE THE RIGOUR AND THE COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING THAT ACCREDITATION BUT I WOULD SAY GO FOR IT.
POD1000000013_S0000223	I MEAN THAT IN THIS YOU ARE LEADING THE WAY IN THE OMBUDSMAN WORLD.
POD1000000013_S0000224	IT IS SOMETHING THAT MANY HAVE TALKED ABOUT. I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT MYSELF.
POD1000000013_S0000225	I'VE TRIED TO DO IT, BUT YOU AND AMANDA HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IT, AND I THINK THAT IS AMAZING.
POD1000000013_S0000226	SO MY ADVICE IS TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY.
POD1000000013_S0000227	MARIE ANDERSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.
POD1000000013_S0000228	IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE PRIVILEGE AND A PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU.
POD1000000013_S0000230	THANK YOU, ROB. THANK YOU.
POD1000000013_S0000232	THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO RADIO OMBUDSMAN. WE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK SO PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW OR COMMENT.
POD1000000013_S0000233	IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR, PLEASE SHARE AND SUBSCRIBE TO FUTURE EPISODES.
POD1000000015_S0000001	HELLO, THIS IS ROB BARRONS HERE, WELCOMING YOU TO ANOTHER EPISODE OF RADIO OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000002	I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY THAT MY GUEST TODAY IS ROSEMARY AGNEW, SCOTTISH PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000003	ROSEMARY TOOK UP THE POST OF OMBUDSMAN AROUND THE SAME TIME AS I DID IN 2017 AND BEFORE THIS SHE WAS THE SCOTTISH INFORMATION COMMISSIONER.
POD1000000015_S0000004	SHE HAS A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC SERVICE WHICH WE'LL COME ON TO.
POD1000000015_S0000005	SHE HAS DEVELOPED THE IDEA OF A COMPLAINT STANDARDS AUTHORITY IN SCOTLAND, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO ASK HER ABOUT.
POD1000000015_S0000006	ROSEMARY, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
POD1000000015_S0000007	NOW, WE LIKE TO START EACH EPISODE BY HEARING A BIT ABOUT OUR GUESTS AND WHERE THEY COME FROM.
POD1000000015_S0000008	SO CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR EARLY LIFE AND THE VALUES YOU GOT FROM THAT?
POD1000000015_S0000009	I AM HUGELY LUCKY. I COME FROM A VERY LOVING FAMILY.
POD1000000015_S0000010	I HAVE FOUR YOUNGER BROTHERS, SO I THINK IT FAIR TO SAY THAT ISSUES ABOUT EQUALITY WERE PROBABLY IN THERE BEFORE I EVEN KNEW THE WORD.
POD1000000015_S0000011	BUT MY FAMILY ARE MILITARY FAMILIES, SO I TRAVELLED AROUND AS A CHILD.
POD1000000015_S0000012	AND MOSTLY I'D SAY WHAT I GOT FROM THEM WAS A REAL STRONG MORAL COMPASS.
POD1000000015_S0000013	NOT DRILLED INTO ME, MUST DO THIS, MUSTN'T DO THAT, BUT ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE WITH RESPECT, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE WERE TRAVELLING TO NEW PLACES AND MEETING NEW PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
POD1000000015_S0000014	AND I THINK THAT THAT MORAL AND ETHICAL BACKGROUND, NOT CALLED THAT THEN,
POD1000000015_S0000015	IT WAS JUST TRY AND BE A GOOD PERSON, TELL THE TRUTH, DO YOUR HOMEWORK ON TIME, ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS PROBABLY INSTILLED IN ME A STRONG WORK ETHIC.
POD1000000015_S0000016	BUT IT ALSO INSTILLED IN ME A VERY DEEP LEVEL OF CARING FOR PEOPLE.
POD1000000015_S0000017	HMM.
POD1000000015_S0000018	BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO SEE OVER THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE STILL A WHOLE RANGE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT STARTS IN LIFE, DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES.
POD1000000015_S0000019	AND I THINK WITHIN THAT I'VE DEVELOPED MY OWN SENSE OF JUSTICE.
POD1000000015_S0000020	AND I'M HUGELY GRATEFUL TO MY PARENTS, THEY'RE LOVELY PEOPLE.
POD1000000015_S0000021	AND I EVEN GET ON WITH MY BROTHERS OCCASIONALLY.
POD1000000015_S0000023	WHEN YOU WERE TRAVELLING AROUND AS PART OF THE MILITARY FAMILY, WAS THAT DIFFICULT? DID YOU FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER?
POD1000000015_S0000024	YES AND NO TO OUTSIDER.
POD1000000015_S0000025	I WENT TO A LOT OF SCHOOLS, SO YOU HAD TO LEARN TO MAKE FRIENDS QUICKLY AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE A LONG LEAD IN TIME, IF YOU LIKE.
POD1000000015_S0000026	BECAUSE I LIVED A LOT OF TIME IN MILITARY ACCOMMODATION, THAT WAS LIKE A BIG FAMILY OF ITSELF, BECAUSE YOU TENDED TO BE WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION.
POD1000000015_S0000027	BUT MOSTLY I SUPPOSE I JUST SAW IT AS A BIG SENSE OF ADVENTURE.
POD1000000015_S0000028	IT DOESN'T SUIT ALL, BUT FOR ME IT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I JUST MOVED AROUND, HAD A WHOLE WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE WHICH I DON'T THINK I'D HAVE GOT IN ANY OTHER WAY.
POD1000000015_S0000029	WHAT DID YOU STUDY AT UNIVERSITY?
POD1000000015_S0000030	WELL, MY MAIN CLAIM TO FAME, I THINK, SITTING HERE IN MANCHESTER, IS THE THING THAT I'M PROBABLY MOST PLEASED WITH, IS MY MBA FROM MANCHESTER BUSINESS SCHOOL.
POD1000000015_S0000031	I ALSO HAVE A TEACHING QUALIFICATION.
POD1000000015_S0000032	BUT I THINK THE MBA, BECAUSE I WENT BACK TO THAT AFTER I'D BEEN WORKING A WHILE, WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ENLIGHTENING PART OF MY EDUCATION.
POD1000000015_S0000033	BECAUSE AGAIN I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT WHAT IT GAVE ME BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO REFLECT ON A WORKING BACKGROUND AS WELL
POD1000000015_S0000034	WHAT IT GAVE ME WAS A SENSE OF HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGE IN A WAY PERHAPS I HADN'T DONE BEFORE THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000035	THEY'RE VERY FAMOUS ALUMNI FROM THAT MBA. I THINK VINCENT CAMPANY IS A GRADUATE OF THAT SCHEME. DID YOU KNOW HIM?
POD1000000015_S0000036	NO, I DIDN'T. IN FACT, I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF MY COHORT ARE NAMES THAT HAVE COME UP TO PROMINENCE
POD1000000015_S0000037	BUT HAVE ALL GONE ON TO DO GOOD THINGS, SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS.
POD1000000015_S0000038	I FOR MYSELF, BECAUSE I WAS PUBLIC SECTOR AT THE TIME AND I'VE REMAINED PUBLIC SECTOR FOR MOST OF THE TIME SINCE THEN, PERHAPS HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF IT.
POD1000000015_S0000039	BECAUSE I WAS VERY DELIBERATE IN NOT ALWAYS GOING DOWN PUBLIC SECTOR ROUTES FOR STUDY OR PUBLIC SECTOR MODULES BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DIFFERENT SORTS OF THINKING.
POD1000000015_S0000040	WHEN DID YOU DECIDE WHAT SORT OF CAREER YOU WANTED?
POD1000000015_S0000041	I'M YET TO MEET AN OMBUDSMAN WHO DECIDED THEY WANTED TO BE AN OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000042	YEP.
POD1000000015_S0000043	I THINK
POD1000000015_S0000044	I CAN OWN UP TO THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000045	IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
POD1000000015_S0000046	I WENT TO WORK, I WAS WORKING IN CHINA, LECTURING IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS, AND I NEEDED A JOB WHEN I GOT BACK.
POD1000000015_S0000047	SO I THOUGHT, OH, THEY'RE ADVERTISING FOR INVESTIGATORS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN. THAT'LL DO FOR A WHILE. IT'LL PAY THE MORTGAGE UNTIL I GET SOMETHING ELSE.
POD1000000015_S0000048	AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH NEVER LEFT OMBUDSMANING OR INFORMATION COMMISSIONING SINCE.
POD1000000015_S0000049	AND I THINK WHAT IT WAS, WAS I FOUND A JOB THAT I ENJOYED, IT WAS CHALLENGING, BUT ACTUALLY FITTED IN WITH MY VALUE SYSTEM.
POD1000000015_S0000050	RIGHT, AND YOU'VE HAD A VERY DISTINGUISHED AND VARIED CAREER. YOU WERE THE SCOTTISH INFORMATION COMMISSIONER.
POD1000000015_S0000051	NOW WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU CAME TO THE SCOTTISH PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN?
POD1000000015_S0000052	I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT HIGHLIGHT IS IN TERMS OF BEING THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
POD1000000015_S0000053	THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I DID THAT I WAS REALLY PROUD OF IN A GOOD WAY.
POD1000000015_S0000054	ONE OF THEM WAS, IT SOUNDS VERY TRIVIAL, BUT WE ESTABLISHED A PORTAL FOR THE UPLOADING OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION STATISTICS FROM PUBLIC BODIES IN SCOTLAND.
POD1000000015_S0000055	AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOW THERE IS A THREE OR FOUR YEAR DATABASE OF THE NUMBER OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS AND THE OUTCOME OF THEM FOR THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND.
POD1000000015_S0000056	THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TRENDS, WE CAN LOOK AT DEVELOPMENTS.
POD1000000015_S0000057	AND THAT ACTUALLY, FOR ME, WAS A HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE I DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT POWER TO DO IT.
POD1000000015_S0000058	IT WAS DONE THROUGH COOPERATION AND CO WORKING WITH PUBLIC BODIES.
POD1000000015_S0000059	THE OTHER COUPLE OF THINGS THAT REALLY STICK IN MY MIND WAS VERY, VERY EARLY ON A PARTICULAR DECISION I MADE
POD1000000015_S0000060	WHICH WAS TELLING THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT THEY HAD TO DISCLOSE WHETHER THEY HAD TAKEN LEGAL ADVICE ABOUT SCOTLAND'S POSITION WITH EUROPE.
POD1000000015_S0000061	SHOULD THEY GAIN INDEPENDENCE, BECAUSE IT WAS THE TIME OF THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM.
POD1000000015_S0000062	YEAH.
POD1000000015_S0000063	AND WHY THAT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IS IT WAS A VERY BIG ISSUE, I THINK, IN THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AND NOBODY, I THINK, COULD HAVE FORESEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW.
POD1000000015_S0000064	THE FINAL ONE, WHICH I THINK I'LL TALK ABOUT MORE WHEN WE TALK MAYBE ABOUT SOME OF THE OMBUDSMAN POWERS,
POD1000000015_S0000065	WAS ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY OF INTERVENING IN RELATION TO GOOD AND POOR PRACTICE WITH SCOTTISH PUBLIC BODIES.
POD1000000015_S0000066	YOU'RE ENGLISH, I THINK. IS THAT CORRECT?
POD1000000015_S0000067	YES.
POD1000000015_S0000068	SO HAS THERE EVER BEEN AN ISSUE ABOUT YOU HOLDING PRESTIGIOUS AND IMPORTANT JOBS IN SCOTLAND?
POD1000000015_S0000069	ABOUT AN ENGLISH PERSON HAVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY.
POD1000000015_S0000070	NO, I HAVE A SCOTTISH NAME, AGNEW IS A SCOTTISH NAME AND I AM MARRIED TO SOMEBODY FROM SCOTTISH DESCENT.
POD1000000015_S0000071	I WAS ONCE ASKED BY A JOURNALIST, WAS I HAPPY THAT I HAD ADOPTED SCOTLAND AS MY HOME?
POD1000000015_S0000072	AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE ANSWER REFLECTED HOW I FELT, WHICH WAS I'M ETERNALLY GRATEFUL THAT SCOTLAND HAS ADOPTED ME AS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES THERE AND DOES THESE THINGS WITHIN SCOTLAND.
POD1000000015_S0000073	BUT NO, IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TO BEING IN ENGLAND, BUT I'VE NEVER, NOT TO MY FACE ANYWAY, EVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH BEING ENGLISH.
POD1000000015_S0000074	THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
POD1000000015_S0000075	NOW, CAN WE JUST TALK A BIT ABOUT THE SCOTTISH OMBUDSMAN, WHICH YOU TOOK UP POST NEARLY THREE YEARS AGO?
POD1000000015_S0000076	THE DEVOLVED OMBUDSMEN ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE UK OMBUDSMEN.
POD1000000015_S0000077	BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE MODERN, THEY'VE ADOPTED LEGISLATION TO MAKE THEM MORE RELEVANT TO DEVELOPING SITUATIONS. AND YOU HAVE MORE POWERS THAN THE UK OMBUDSMAN HAS.
POD1000000015_S0000078	WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING THE HEAD OF AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN? IS THAT A GOOD THING?
POD1000000015_S0000079	YES, I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF INSIGHT, YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF OVERVIEW AND SECTORS DO VARY.
POD1000000015_S0000080	THERE IS VARIANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING TO DIFFERENT REGULATIONS. IT MAKES YOUR JOB VERY VARIED ALSO.
POD1000000015_S0000081	I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH IT THOUGH IS IF YOU WORK IN A SPECIFIC SECTOR
POD1000000015_S0000082	SO IF I REFLECT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN, YOU BECAME MUCH MORE IMMERSED IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000015_S0000083	WHEN YOU WORK ACROSS SECTORS, WHAT WE FIND IS, PARTICULARLY A PERSONAL REFLECTION IS, I HAVE TO DO A BIT MORE DIGGING ROUND TO FIND OUT ABOUT HOW THE SECTORS OPERATE IN SCOTLAND.
POD1000000015_S0000084	AND I ALSO RELY QUITE A LOT ON PROFESSIONAL ADVICE, PARTICULARLY FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL WORK.
POD1000000015_S0000085	SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY DEVELOP THROUGH EXPERIENCE OF VOLUME OF CASES THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE PERHAPS LOOKING AT
POD1000000015_S0000086	ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF PUBLIC SERVICE.
POD1000000015_S0000087	BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK REFLECTS WITH MYSELF AND THE WELSH AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND OMBUDSMAN IS BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY IS SMALLER,
POD1000000015_S0000088	AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF HAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF STRUCTURE TO IT.
POD1000000015_S0000089	YOU OFTEN GET GIVEN THINGS TO DO THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT AN OMBUDSMAN TO BE DOING.
POD1000000015_S0000090	SO AS WELL AS COMPLAINT HANDLING AND THE COMPLAINT STANDARDS, WE ALSO HAVE DUTIES FOR, WITH THE FINAL STAGE OF APPEAL, FOR A BENEFIT SCOTTISH WELFARE FUND.
POD1000000015_S0000091	AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT NORTHERN IRELAND AND WALES, THEY ALSO HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT.
POD1000000015_S0000092	AND I THINK THAT IS AS MUCH A CHALLENGE AS ANYTHING, BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE RUNNING TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS, BUT TRYING TO HAVE AN INTEGRATED ORGANISATION.
POD1000000015_S0000093	OKAY, SO YOU RELY ON PROFESSIONAL ADVICE, BUT THERE MUST ALSO BE A CHALLENGE FOR YOUR CASE HANDLERS TO DEAL WITH THE WIDTH OF FUNCTIONS THAT THEY COME UP WITH.
POD1000000015_S0000094	ARE YOU DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE SECTORS OR DO PEOPLE HAVE
POD1000000015_S0000096	MULTITASKING TO DO.
POD1000000015_S0000097	THEY HAVE MULTITASKING TO DO AND THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLE SET OF PEOPLE, MY INVESTIGATORS.
POD1000000015_S0000098	BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES US AND THAT IS PROBABLY THE UNITING THING IS VERY MUCH ABOUT VALUES.
POD1000000015_S0000099	AND I THINK LIKE MOST OMBUDSMAN ORGANISATIONS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS, IT'S A FAIRLY UNIQUE WORKFORCE I WOULD SAY.
POD1000000015_S0000100	BECAUSE YOU ASK ANYBODY WHY WE'RE THERE AND VERY RARELY WILL YOU DEVIATE FAR FROM BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE IMPROVEMENT, BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.
POD1000000015_S0000101	SO YES, IT'S A CHALLENGE HAVING THE SCOPE AND WE HAVE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN A PARTICULAR AREA, BUT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIALISTS.
POD1000000015_S0000102	OK, NOW WHAT YOU HAVE, WHICH WE DON'T HAVE, IS THE STATUS OF BEING A COMPLAINT STANDARDS AUTHORITY.
POD1000000015_S0000103	COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO OUR LISTENERS BRIEFLY WHAT THAT MEANS?
POD1000000015_S0000104	BRIEFLY, WHAT IT MEANS IS THE OMBUDSMAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING A MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS THAT ALL SCOTTISH BODIES MUST FOLLOW.
POD1000000015_S0000105	AND WE THEN, WITH THAT, HAVE A DUTY TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE IN RELATION TO COMPLAINT HANDLING AND COMBINED WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER POWERS, DUTY TO ENFORCE GOOD PRACTICE TO REPORT ON IT.
POD1000000015_S0000106	NOW THAT SOUNDS, YOU KNOW, OH THAT'S NICE, MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING.
POD1000000015_S0000107	BUT WHAT IT MEANS IN PRACTICE IS WITH SOME SLIGHT VARIATIONS BY SECTOR, BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTORS HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NEEDS,
POD1000000015_S0000108	IT MEANS THAT ANYBODY MAKING A COMPLAINT TO A PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND AND ABOUT A PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND IS BASICALLY MAKING A COMPLAINT UNDER THE SAME SET OF STANDARDS.
POD1000000015_S0000109	SO THE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS SAYS THAT THE FIRST STAGE OF A COMPLAINT YOU MUST TRY AND RESPOND WITHIN FIVE WORKING DAYS TO RESOLVE IT.
POD1000000015_S0000110	VERY BIG FOCUS ON RESOLUTION.
POD1000000015_S0000111	IF YOU CAN'T OR THE PERSON IS NOT SATISFIED, YOU CAN THEN TAKE ANOTHER 20 WORKING DAYS TO LOOK AT IT IN MORE DETAIL.
POD1000000015_S0000112	IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED MORE THAN 20 DAYS FOR, THEN TALK TO THE COMPLAINER ABOUT THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000113	BUT IT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE OR DOESN'T RECEIVE A RESPONSE IN TIME, THEY GET TO THE OMBUDSMAN A LOT QUICKER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE DO.
POD1000000015_S0000114	THE OTHER BENEFIT OF THE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS IS THAT THERE IS A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS.
POD1000000015_S0000115	SO THE STANDARDS THAT GO WITH THIS, WHICH INCIDENTALLY I HAVE TO LAY BEFORE THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THE STANDARDS,
POD1000000015_S0000116	THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG BENT ON LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS.
POD1000000015_S0000117	AND I THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE CAN PERHAPS DEVELOP MORE IN HOW WE HOLD PUBLIC BODIES TO ACCOUNT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT LEARNING.
POD1000000015_S0000118	BECAUSE LIKE OUR COMPLAINTS, THE MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING, WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS AN IMPACT AND THAT THERE IS VALUE TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO PUBLIC SERVICES AS A WHOLE.
POD1000000015_S0000119	I THINK FOR ME THE MOST VALUABLE THING ABOUT IT THOUGH IS IT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PUBLIC BODIES, NOT ALWAYS IN OPPOSITION TO THEM.
POD1000000015_S0000120	WHICH WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD, HOWEVER MUCH YOU TRY A RESOLUTION OR A SORT OF DISCURSIVE WAY OF LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS,
POD1000000015_S0000121	ONCE A COMPLAINT HAS REACHED THE OMBUDSMAN, IT IS IN MANY WAYS ADVERSARIAL, WHETHER YOU WANT IT TO BE OR NOT.
POD1000000015_S0000122	BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPLAINT HANDLING AS A WHOLE, YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY TO HELP PUBLIC BODIES.
POD1000000015_S0000123	AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET BETTER AT COMPLAINT HANDLING, WHICH YOU HOPE MEANS THEY GET BETTER AT LEARNING FROM COMPLAINTS.
POD1000000015_S0000124	WHICH MEANS PEOPLE GET THE RIGHT SERVICE THE FIRST TIME.
POD1000000015_S0000125	I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER ELIMINATE COMPLAINTS BUT CERTAINLY IT HOPEFULLY WILL MAKE IT A MORE PRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE.
POD1000000015_S0000126	NOW I'M A FULL SUPPORTER OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING
POD1000000015_S0000127	I'M A BURGLAR OF YOUR PRACTICE WHEN I WAS THE HIGHER EDUCATION OMBUDSMAN I STOLE IT HOOK LINE AND SINKER TO USE IN ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES
POD1000000015_S0000128	THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD RESOLVE COMPLAINTS WITHIN FIVE DAYS WAS ANATHEMA TO THEM. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT. WE ENDED UP WITH 90.
POD1000000015_S0000129	BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY DID IT.
POD1000000015_S0000130	BUT THE DIFFERENCE AND THE RADICAL NATURE OF WHAT YOU DO IS EFFECTIVELY YOU ARE A REGULATOR NOW.
POD1000000015_S0000131	WHEREAS OMBUDSMEN HAVE TRADITIONALLY ALWAYS SAID WE RELY ON OUR MORAL AUTHORITY, NOT ON A COERCIVE POWER.
POD1000000015_S0000132	HAS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE OR IS IT JUST WORDS?
POD1000000015_S0000133	NO, I DON'T THINK IT MAKES, IT'S MADE A DIFFERENCE YET.
POD1000000015_S0000134	I ALSO THINK I SHOULD ADD THAT I WASN'T OMBUDSMAN WHEN THE COMPLAINT STANDARD AUTHORITY CAME IN.
POD1000000015_S0000135	YEAH.
POD1000000015_S0000136	AND CREDIT HAS TO GO TO JIM MARTIN, MY PREDECESSOR, FOR DRIVING THIS.
POD1000000015_S0000137	YEP.
POD1000000015_S0000138	WHAT HE'S LEFT ME AS A LEGACY IS SOMETHING REALLY GOOD TO DEVELOP AND WORK WITH, WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.
POD1000000015_S0000139	HAVING BEEN AN INFORMATION COMMISSIONER, WHICH REALLY IS A REGULATORY FUNCTION, YOUR DECISION IS BINDING OR YOU GO TO COURT.
POD1000000015_S0000140	I THINK THE CONCEPT OF REGULATION PROBABLY HASN'T CREPT INTO OUR THINKING WITH COMPLAINT STANDARDS IN QUITE THE SAME WAY.
POD1000000015_S0000141	BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING BUT MAYBE NOT CALLING IT REGULATION IN THE SAME WAY.
POD1000000015_S0000142	BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY LEARNING FROM HINDSIGHT IS THAT WE TOOK A VERY STRUCTURED APPROACH OF ROLLING IT OUT SECTOR BY SECTOR, THIS MODEL COMPLAINTS HANDLING.
POD1000000015_S0000143	AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS IT WAS A NUMBER OF YEARS BEFORE EVERY PUBLIC BODY IN SCOTLAND WAS FOLLOWING THIS.
POD1000000015_S0000144	SO THE NHS WAS THE LAST, AND THAT'S BEEN THE LAST, I THINK, JUST COMING UP TO THE END OF THEIR SECOND YEAR.
POD1000000015_S0000145	IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE FIRST, WHICH WAS LOCAL GOVERNMENT,
POD1000000015_S0000146	LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOW, A REALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COMPLAINTS GET RESPONDED TO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IN THE FIVE WORKING DAYS.
POD1000000015_S0000147	I THINK FROM MEMORY IT'S OVER 80% AND THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR COMPLAINERS.
POD1000000015_S0000148	NOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE WENT LIVE WITH IN APRIL IS WHAT WE'VE CALLED OUR SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION POLICY.
POD1000000015_S0000149	AND THIS IS A CONCEPT THAT I BROUGHT WITH ME FROM BEING INFORMATION COMMISSIONER.
POD1000000015_S0000150	AND BASICALLY WAS LOOKING AT ALL THE POWERS THAT YOU HAVE AS AN OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE THE REAL VALUE COMES IN THE COMBINATION OF THEM, NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL BITS.
POD1000000015_S0000151	SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POWERS TO SET COMPLAINT HANDLING PROCESSES TO TAKE ACTION IF COMPLAINT HANDLING FALLS SHORT, YOU THEN LOOK AT OTHER THINGS LIKE YOUR INFORMATION GATHERING POWERS,
POD1000000015_S0000152	WE'VE CREATED A FRAMEWORK WHICH SETS OUT WHAT OUR POWERS ARE AND WITHIN THAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO EITHER SUPPORT OR IF NECESSARY INTERVENE.
POD1000000015_S0000153	BECAUSE WHEN WE, FOR EXAMPLE, A SIMPLE EXAMPLE, WE MIGHT SEE A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM A PUBLIC BODY WHERE THE FINAL RESPONSE THAT THEY GIVE TO THE COMPLAINER DOES NOT SIGNPOST THE OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000154	THEY HAVE A DUTY TO DO THAT UNDER THE COMPLAINTS HANDLING PROCESS.
POD1000000015_S0000155	SO WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE, WE'RE LOGGING FEEDBACK, RECOMMENDATIONS, OBSERVATIONS FROM WHAT WE SEE IN COMPLAINTS.
POD1000000015_S0000156	SO IF WE SPOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WE MIGHT JUST, WELL, MY INVESTIGATORS, MY COMPLAINTS REVIEWERS WILL LET THE PUBLIC BODY KNOW.
POD1000000015_S0000157	WE GIVE FEEDBACK IN DECISIONS.
POD1000000015_S0000158	IF WE KEEP SEEING THAT, WE MIGHT GIVE IT MORE FORMAL AND SAY WE SPOTTED THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES.
POD1000000015_S0000159	BUT IS THERE ANY HELP? WE MIGHT OFFER TO, SAY, SHARE A TEMPLATE LETTER.
POD1000000015_S0000160	OR IF IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT, PERHAPS GO AND GIVE THEM SOME TRAINING IF WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCE TO DO THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000161	BUT WE SET IT OUT STEP BY STEP AT WHICH POINT IT BECOMES A MANAGEMENT ISSUE AND SENIOR MANAGERS MIGHT ACTUALLY CONTACT SENIOR MANAGERS OR CHIEF EXECUTIVES.
POD1000000015_S0000162	THE ULTIMATE BEING WE USE THE POWERS THAT THE OMBUDSMAN HAS TO ENFORCE AND REPORT.
POD1000000015_S0000164	VERY INCREMENTAL AND CIVILIZED. BUT DO YOU COME ACROSS INTRANSIGENCE?
POD1000000015_S0000165	WELL, IT WENT LIVE IN APRIL AND SO FAR WE'VE NOT FOUND INTRANSIGENCE.
POD1000000015_S0000166	AND I THINK SOME OF THIS IS DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE OF
POD1000000015_S0000167	INFORMATION COMMISSIONER THAT I'LL GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE
POD1000000015_S0000168	SIMILAR POWERS TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION FOR AN INVESTIGATION
POD1000000015_S0000169	AND TELLING PUBLIC BODIES VERY FORMALLY, IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THIS, THIS AND THIS BY THIS DATE, I WILL REPORT ON THIS. I WILL TAKE FURTHER ACTION.
POD1000000015_S0000170	IT CAN ACTUALLY BE TREATED AS CONTEMPT OF COURT IN SCOTLAND.
POD1000000015_S0000171	SO YOU ONLY NEED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AND TO DO IT ONCE AND THEN REPORT ON IT IN YOUR ANNUAL REPORT.
POD1000000015_S0000172	AND ACTUALLY PUBLIC BODIES REALISE, I THINK, THAT YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS.
POD1000000015_S0000173	BUT WE TRY TO GET TO THE POINT BEFORE THAT WHERE YOU POINT OUT THIS IS THE VALUE, PARTICULARLY FOR THE COMPLAINER OF DOING THIS.
POD1000000015_S0000174	SO WE'RE IN EARLY DAYS, WE HAVEN'T COME ACROSS THE REAL INTRANSIGENCE YET.
POD1000000015_S0000175	BUT I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THERE'LL BE SOME THERE AT SOME POINT.
POD1000000015_S0000176	BUT THE WORD CIVILIZED IS A GOOD ONE AND WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO BE AS CIVILIZED AS WE CAN BUT FIRM WITH IT.
POD1000000015_S0000177	WHAT IS YOUR REPORT TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT?
POD1000000015_S0000178	YES.
POD1000000015_S0000179	WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH THAT BODY?
POD1000000015_S0000180	I'D SAY IT'S PRETTY GOOD IN THE SENSE OF IT'S OPEN, CHALLENGING AND WHEN I SAY FRIENDLY, I DON'T MEAN WE'RE ALL FRIENDS. IT'S VERY PROFESSIONAL IN MANY WAYS.
POD1000000015_S0000181	SO MY MAIN DEALINGS ARE WITH THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENTARY CORPORATE BODY.
POD1000000015_S0000182	I GET MY FUNDING THROUGH THEM, SO WE HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS.
POD1000000015_S0000183	EACH YEAR I APPEAR BEFORE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITIES COMMITTEE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY ANNUAL REPORTS.
POD1000000015_S0000184	SO THEY'LL ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE, ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.
POD1000000015_S0000185	I DO APPEAR BEFORE OTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL, EITHER IN RELATION TO OTHER POLICIES OR IN RELATION TO OTHER CONSULTATIONS THAT WE'VE RESPONDED TO.
POD1000000015_S0000186	I WOULD SAY IN SCOTLAND THAT GENERALLY THE OMBUDSMAN IS HELD IN HIGH REGARD AND SEEN AS BEING INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL.
POD1000000015_S0000187	AND PROBABLY THE MOST TELLING EVIDENCE OF THIS IS WE'RE TAKING ON NEW POWERS NEXT YEAR.
POD1000000015_S0000188	THIS IS ABOUT WHISTLE BLOWING.
POD1000000015_S0000189	YES, I'M TAKING ON THE WONDERFUL TITLE OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL WHISTLEBLOWING OFFICER FOR THE NHS IN SCOTLAND.
POD1000000015_S0000190	WOW.
POD1000000015_S0000191	AND THE REASON THAT WE ARE TAKING ON THIS FUNCTION IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S PUBLIC CONSULTATION, IT WAS SUGGESTED IT SHOULD BE THE OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000192	IT'S ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW IN A SMALLER JURISDICTION YOU GET A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
POD1000000015_S0000193	BUT GOING BACK TO PARLIAMENT, THEY HAVE HELD ME TO ACCOUNT ON THINGS, BUT ALSO WHERE I HAVE BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THEM IN MY COMMITTEE APPEARANCES, THEY'VE ALSO BEEN QUITE SUPPORTIVE.
POD1000000015_S0000194	SO ONE OF MY BEEFS ABOUT MY LEGISLATION IS COMPLAINTS MUST BE IN WRITING UNLESS THERE ARE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
POD1000000015_S0000195	NOW THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THE ONUS IS ON THE COMPLAINER TO SHOW SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
POD1000000015_S0000196	AND IT MEANS YOU CAN'T BE AS FLEXIBLE IN HOW YOU TAKE COMPLAINTS.
POD1000000015_S0000197	YEAH.
POD1000000015_S0000198	AND I'VE BEEN TRYING SINCE I BECAME OMBUDSMAN TO HAVE THE LEGISLATION, IT'S SECONDARY LEGISLATION, TO SAY I CAN TAKE COMPLAINTS IN ANY FORMAT.
POD1000000015_S0000199	AND AT THE LAST PARLIAMENTARY APPEARANCE, THE COMMITTEE DID ACTUALLY WRITE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND SAY, WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. PLEASE COULD YOU LOOK INTO THIS AGAIN FOR US?
POD1000000015_S0000200	SADLY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT ARE NOT TAKING IT FORWARD AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE OTHER BUSINESS AND DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCE APPARENTLY WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING.
POD1000000015_S0000201	WE'RE COMING TOWARDS THE END, BUT LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUICKFIRE QUESTIONS.
POD1000000015_S0000202	SO YOU'RE FUNDED DIFFERENTLY TO THE WAY WE'RE FUNDED BECAUSE WE GET OUR MONEY FROM A BROAD TREASURY VOTE.
POD1000000015_S0000203	BUT YOU'RE FUNDED THROUGH PARLIAMENT.
POD1000000015_S0000204	HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH MONEY? IS THAT A SATISFACTORY WAY TO DO THINGS?
POD1000000015_S0000205	NO, I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH MONEY.
POD1000000015_S0000206	AND IT'S SATISFACTORY IN THE SENSE OF I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT THE FUNDING DOESN'T COME FROM GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000015_S0000207	IT ADDS SOMETHING TO YOUR BEING ABLE TO SAY, I AM INDEPENDENT. WHAT I THINK IS UNSATISFACTORY ABOUT IT IS, AND PROBABLY THE SAME FOR YOU, IS THE ANNUALITY OF IT.
POD1000000015_S0000208	IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO PROPER BUSINESS AND RESOURCE PLANNING WHEN YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT NEXT YEAR.
POD1000000015_S0000209	IT ALSO MEANS THAT I FEEL I DO GO THROUGH SOME FAIRLY UNNECESSARY HOOPS JUST TO GET ONE ADDITIONAL MEMBER OF STAFF OR AN EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF MONEY FOR THIS.
POD1000000015_S0000210	WHERE IT DOES WORK WELL AND WHERE I THINK THE CORPORATE BODY REALLY TRY HARD FOR MYSELF AND OTHER PARLIAMENTARY CROWN APPOINTMENTS
POD1000000015_S0000211	IS THEY HOLD A CONTINGENCY FUND TO WHICH WE CAN APPLY
POD1000000015_S0000212	FOR UNEXPECTED THINGS. SO IF WE WERE JUDICIALLY REVIEWED, WE COULD GET LEGAL COSTS THROUGH THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000213	AND THAT WORKS WELL TO THE POINT WE HAD SOME UNEXPECTED IT COSTS THIS YEAR WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO THE CONTINGENCY FUND.
POD1000000015_S0000214	BUT GENERALLY I THINK OMBUDSMEN ACROSS THE UK ARE UNDERFUNDED.
POD1000000015_S0000215	IF WE HAD SUFFICIENT FUNDING, WE WOULDN'T HAVE BACKLOGS OF CASES, WE WOULD BE DOING THINGS QUICKER.
POD1000000015_S0000216	BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT.
POD1000000015_S0000217	TWO FINAL QUESTIONS, ROSEMARY. FIRST OF ALL, GOING FORWARD, WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE AS THE OMBUDSMAN?
POD1000000015_S0000218	ARE YOU AN OMBUDSMAN?
POD1000000015_S0000219	I'M HAPPY TO BE AN OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATION SAYS AND I KNOW THE ORIGINS OF THE WORD.
POD1000000015_S0000220	BUT EQUALLY, I DON'T MIND IF OTHER PEOPLE CALL ME SOMETHING SIMILAR, WHATEVER THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.
POD1000000015_S0000221	IT'S THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE DO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
POD1000000015_S0000222	I THINK MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR MY OFFICE IS A COMBINATION OF RESOURCING AND THE WHISTLEBLOWING WORK THAT'S COMING NEXT YEAR.
POD1000000015_S0000223	THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS.
POD1000000015_S0000224	WILL YOU HAVE REGULATORY POWERS?
POD1000000015_S0000225	MY POWERS WILL BE VERY SIMILAR AS THEY ARE TO OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000226	RIGHT.
POD1000000015_S0000228	THIS IS BIG.
POD1000000015_S0000229	YEAH.
POD1000000015_S0000230	AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAPPENS IN ENGLAND.
POD1000000015_S0000231	IT'S ALMOST TWO SIMILAR BUT COMPLETELY DISTINCT FUNCTIONS.
POD1000000015_S0000232	TWO DIFFERENT TITLES THAT GO WITH THEM, OMBUDSMAN AND INDEPENDENT.
POD1000000015_S0000234	AS A RESULT OF THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000235	I DON'T KNOW.
POD1000000015_S0000237	I SAY I WOULD LIKE ONE. I'D DO THE JOB ANYWAY.
POD1000000015_S0000238	BUT I SUPPOSE FOR ME THE ISSUE OF THE PAY IS NOT SO MUCH FOR MY TENURE BUT FOR FUTURE OMBUDSMAN.
POD1000000015_S0000239	BECAUSE I HAVE A REAL CONCERN ACROSS, IN COMMON WITH FELLOW OMBUDSMEN IN THE UK, THAT
POD1000000015_S0000240	IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR OMBUDSMAN ENOUGH TO ATTRACT GOOD OMBUDSMAN, YOU CAN'T FOREVER RELY ON WHAT I THINK HAS HAPPENED SO FAR.
POD1000000015_S0000241	JUST IN SCOTLAND, WE'VE JUST GOT GOOD PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE WORK.
POD1000000015_S0000242	HERE.
POD1000000015_S0000243	SO I HOPE THEY UP THE PAY, BUT IF IT'S NOT FOR ME, I DON'T MIND.
POD1000000015_S0000244	WHAT DOES THE LEGISLATION SAY ABOUT SECOND TERMS FOR ONBOARDS?
POD1000000015_S0000245	IN SCOTLAND THERE ARE NO SECOND TERMS.
POD1000000015_S0000246	SO YOU, AFTER FIVE YEARS, YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON, DO YOU?
POD1000000015_S0000247	I
POD1000000015_S0000249	SO UNDER PUBLIC SECTOR LAW IT CAN BE FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS.
POD1000000015_S0000250	SO AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER I ACTUALLY HAD A SIX YEAR TENURE, THIS ONE IS EIGHT YEARS.
POD1000000015_S0000251	BUT AT THE POINT THAT I BECAME OMBUDSMAN, IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING ON THE WHISTLEBLOWING. SO IT'S PROBABLY RIGHT FOR THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000252	BECAUSE JUST THE NEARLY THREE YEARS GETTING TO THE POINT OF KNOWING WHAT THE LEGISLATION IS GOING TO SAY HAS BEEN OVER IN A BLINK OF AN EYE.
POD1000000015_S0000253	OKAY, LAST QUESTION. WE'RE IN MANCHESTER. THIS IS A YOUNG, THRIVING ORGANISATION FULL OF YOUNG GRADUATES WHO'VE JUST COME INTO THE OMBUDSMAN WORLD.
POD1000000015_S0000254	PERHAPS 120 YOUNG GRADUATES IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS.
POD1000000015_S0000255	YOU'RE AN EXPERIENCED, HIGHLY RESPECTED MEMBER OF THE PROFESSION, IF I CAN CALL IT THAT.
POD1000000015_S0000256	WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE TO MY COLLEAGUES JUST COMING INTO THE OMBUDS FIELD?
POD1000000015_S0000257	DON'T EVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE PASSION OF WHAT DRIVES YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.
POD1000000015_S0000258	BUT LEAVE OMBUDSMANING FOR A WHILE AND GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE AND COME BACK TO IT
POD1000000015_S0000259	SO THAT YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW WONDERFUL A VALUES BASED ORGANISATION IS, BUT ALSO SO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WORLD EXPERIENCES.
POD1000000015_S0000260	THAT'S LOVELY. ROSEMARY, IT'S BEEN A GREAT PRIVILEGE FOR US TO LISTEN TO YOU.
POD1000000015_S0000261	THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.
POD1000000015_S0000262	IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO BE HERE ROB.
POD1000000015_S0000264	THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO RADIO OMBUDSMAN. WE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK SO PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW OR COMMENT.
POD1000000015_S0000265	IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR, PLEASE SHARE AND SUBSCRIBE TO FUTURE EPISODES.
POD1000000016_S0000001	IT'S QUIET OUT HERE, THE SEAGULLS.
POD1000000016_S0000003	THE SUN IS WARM BUT IT'S NOT TOO HUMID. IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A GREAT DAY FOR FISHING.
POD1000000016_S0000005	WHY IT STICKS.
POD1000000016_S0000007	WHAT DOES IT SMELL LIKE?
POD1000000016_S0000008	SMELLS LIKE DEAD FISH.
POD1000000016_S0000010	SMELLS LIKE THE WATER.
POD1000000016_S0000012	WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW?
POD1000000016_S0000014	I DON'T KNOW, THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH.
POD1000000016_S0000016	I DON'T KNOW. I JUST WONDER A LOT WHAT IT WAS, WHAT IT WAS LIKE.
POD1000000016_S0000018	THEY SAY OUR PEOPLE WERE BORN ON THE WATER.
POD1000000016_S0000020	WHEN IT OCCURRED, NO ONE CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN. PERHAPS IT WAS IN THE SECOND WEEK, OR THE THIRD, BUT SURELY BY THE FOURTH.
POD1000000016_S0000021	WHEN THEY HAD NOT SEEN THEIR LAND OR ANY LAND FOR SO MANY DAYS THAT THEY LOST COUNT.
POD1000000016_S0000023	IT WAS AFTER THE FEAR HAD TURNED TO DESPAIR AND THE DESPAIR TO RESIGNATION. AND THE RESIGNATION GAVE WAY, FINALLY, TO RESOLVE.
POD1000000016_S0000025	THEY KNEW THEN THAT THEY WOULD NOT HUG THEIR GRANDMOTHERS AGAIN, OR SHARE A LAUGH WITH A COUSIN DURING HIS NUPTIALS, OR SING THEIR BABY SOFTLY TO SLEEP WITH THE SAME LULLABIES THAT THEIR MOTHERS HAD ONCE SUNG TO THEM.
POD1000000016_S0000027	THE TAIL ETERNITY OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN HAD SEVERED THEM SO COMPLETELY THAT IT WAS AS IF NOTHING HAD EVER EXISTED BEFORE.
POD1000000016_S0000029	THAT EVERYTHING THEY EVER KNEW HAD SIMPLY VANISHED FROM THE EARTH.
POD1000000016_S0000031	SOME COULD NOT BEAR THE REALIZATION.
POD1000000016_S0000033	THEY HEAVE THEMSELVES OVER THE WALLS OF WOODEN SHIPS TO SWIM ONE LAST TIME WITH THE ANCESTORS.
POD1000000016_S0000035	OTHERS REFUSED TO EAT, MOUTHS CLAMPED SHUT UNTIL THEIR HEARTS GAVE OUT.
POD1000000016_S0000037	BUT IN THE SUFFOCATING HULL OF A SHIP CALLED THE WHITE LION, BOUND FOR WHERE THEY DID NOT KNOW.
POD1000000016_S0000038	THOSE WHO REFUSED TO DIE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN CHAINED NEXT TO THEM IN THE DARK WERE NO LONGER STRANGERS.
POD1000000016_S0000040	THEY HAD BEEN FORGED IN TRAUMA.
POD1000000016_S0000042	THEY HAVE BEEN MADE BLACK BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO BE WHITE.
POD1000000016_S0000044	AND WHERE THEY WERE HEADED, BLACK EQUALS SLAVE.
POD1000000016_S0000046	SO THESE WERE THEIR PEOPLE NOW.
POD1000000016_S0000048	WHAT HAPPENED HERE. UM...
POD1000000016_S0000050	I MEAN, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW A LOT.
POD1000000016_S0000052	A PIRATE SHIP BY THE NAME OF WHITE LION SAILS INTO THE BAY HERE.
POD1000000016_S0000053	AND THEY NEEDED TO TRADE SOMETHING OF VALUE SO THAT THEY COULD GET SUPPLIES TO MAKE THE REST OF THEIR JOURNEY AND WHAT THEY TRADED WERE 20 TO 30 AFRICANS.
POD1000000016_S0000054	AND THIS WOULD BE AT THIS PLACE, KIND OF IRONICALLY CALLED POINT COMFORT, WHERE SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES THAT WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE UNITED STATES BEGINS.
POD1000000016_S0000056	FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE, I'M NICOLE HANNAH JONES. THIS IS 1619.
POD1000000016_S0000059	THAT'S YOUR HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, NICOLE. THIS IS A TAPE FOR NICOLE.
POD1000000016_S0000060	HELLO, DARLING. HOW YOU DOING? EXCUSE ME WHILE I PARTAKE OF THIS KANSAS STEAK.
POD1000000016_S0000061	THAT'S OKAY.
POD1000000016_S0000062	WHEN I WAS A CHILD, MY DAD ALWAYS FLEW A FLAG IN OUR FRONT YARD. OUR HOUSE IS ON A CORNER LOT, AND IN THE FRONT YARD, RIGHT IN THE CORNER, WAS THIS.
POD1000000016_S0000063	I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TALL IT WAS, IT ALWAYS SEEMED REALLY GARISHLY TALL TO ME AT THE TIME. THERE WAS THIS VERY TALL ALUMINUM FLAGPOLE. MY PARENTS DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, SO OUR HOUSE ALWAYS HAD PAINT CHIPPING.
POD1000000016_S0000064	AND THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT WAS IN DISARRAY. YOU KNOW, THE GRASS WAS LOOKING DISHEVELED OR THE RAILING ON THE STAIRS WAS FALLING OFF, BUT THE FLAG WAS ALWAYS PRISTINE.
POD1000000016_S0000065	AS SOON AS IT STARTED TO SHOW EVEN THE SLIGHTEST TATTER, MY DAD WOULD REPLACE THE FLAG WITH A FRESH NEW FLAG.
POD1000000016_S0000066	HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW A TATTER FLAG TO FLY. AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. I DIDN'T KNOW OTHER BLACK KIDS WHOSE PARENTS WERE FLYING A FLAG IN THEIR FRONT YARD.
POD1000000016_S0000067	I KNEW LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE WHO FLEW FLAGS. LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE WHO FLEW FLAGS.
POD1000000016_S0000069	MY DAD WAS BORN ON A SHARECROPPING FARM IN GREENWOOD, MISSISSIPPI, WHERE HIS FAMILY PICKED COTTON IN THE SAME COTTON FIELDS THAT ENSLAVED PEOPLE HAD PICKED COTTON NOT TOO LONG BEFORE.
POD1000000016_S0000070	THAT COUNTY, LEFLORE COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI, LYNCHED MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI, AND MISSISSIPPI LYNCHED MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY.
POD1000000016_S0000071	SO IT WAS A PRETTY DEVASTATINGLY VIOLENT AND HARD PLACE TO LIVE.
POD1000000016_S0000073	MY DAD'S MOM FLED THE SOUTH LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER BLACK PEOPLE DURING THE GREAT MIGRATION AND CAME NORTH TO WATERLOO AND FOUND MANY OF THE SAME BARRIERS THAT SHE HAD SOUGHT TO ESCAPE.
POD1000000016_S0000074	SHE WAS FORCED TO BUY A HOUSE ON THE BLACK SIDE OF TOWN. MOST JOBS WERE UNAVAILABLE TO HER, SO SHE CLEANED WHITE PEOPLE'S HOUSES. MY FATHER WENT TO SEGREGATED SCHOOLS.
POD1000000016_S0000075	AND AT A YOUNG AGE, MY FATHER JOINED THE MILITARY SO THAT HE COULD GET HIS WAY OUT OF POVERTY, BUT ALSO FOR THE REASONS THAT SO MANY BLACK PEOPLE JOINED THE MILITARY.
POD1000000016_S0000076	WHICH IS HE HOPED THAT IF HE SERVED HIS COUNTRY, HIS COUNTRY MIGHT FINALLY SEE HIM AS AN AMERICAN.
POD1000000016_S0000077	HE LOVED BEING IN THE ARMY. HE WAS STATIONED IN GERMANY, PICKED UP GERMAN VERY QUICKLY. HE WAS SO SMART.
POD1000000016_S0000078	HE LOVED TALKING ABOUT THAT TIME. IT WAS A PERIOD WHERE HE GOT TO SEE THINGS THAT POOR BLACK CHILD BORN IN MISSISSIPPI WOULD NOT NORMALLY GET TO SEE.
POD1000000016_S0000079	BUT THE MILITARY DIDN'T END UP BEING A WAY OUT FOR MY DAD FOR LONG. HE WAS PASSED UP FOR OPPORTUNITIES.
POD1000000016_S0000080	AND THE ONLY JOBS MY DAD EVER WORKED WERE SERVICE JOBS. HE WORKED AS A CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK OR A BUS DRIVER. AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
POD1000000016_S0000081	THIS BIG, PRISTINE AMERICAN FLAG FLYING IN THE FRONT OF OUR YARD WAS DEEPLY EMBARRASSING TO ME.
POD1000000016_S0000082	AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD FEEL THAT MUCH LOVE FOR A COUNTRY THAT CLEARLY DID NOT LOVE HIM.
POD1000000016_S0000084	I FELT THIS WAY ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS NO LONGER STANDING FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. I HAD STOPPED SAYING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. AND REALLY,
POD1000000016_S0000085	THROUGHOUT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE, I MEAN, CLEARLY I KNOW I'M AN AMERICAN.
POD1000000016_S0000086	I WAS BORN HERE. EVERY FAMILY MEMBER FOR GENERATIONS BACK THAT I KNOW WERE ALL BORN HERE. BUT I NEVER FELT LIKE I COULD CLAIM FULLY THAT I WAS AN AMERICAN.
POD1000000016_S0000088	BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I REALLY STARTED RESEARCHING AND READING AND THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT THAT MY OWN THINKING STARTED TO SHIFT.
POD1000000016_S0000089	THAT I REALIZED MY DAD UNDERSTOOD THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW.
POD1000000016_S0000090	I NOW UNDERSTAND FOR THE FIRST TIME WHY MY DAD WAS SO PROUD TO FLY THAT FLAG.
POD1000000016_S0000093	MY NAME IS FOUNTAIN HUGHES. I WAS BORN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA.
POD1000000016_S0000094	MY GRANDFATHER BELONGED TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. MY GRANDFATHER WAS 115 YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED. AND NOW I AM 101 YEARS OLD.
POD1000000016_S0000095	NOW IN MY BOY DAYS, WE WERE SLAVES, WE BELONGED TO PEOPLE. THEY'D SELL US, LIKE THEY SELL HORSES AND COWS AND HOGS AND ALL LIKE THAT, HAVE AN AUCTION BENCH.
POD1000000016_S0000096	PUT YOU UP ON THE BENCH AND BEAT ON YOU, THE SAME AS YOU'RE BEATING ON A CAT, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000016_S0000097	BUT STILL I DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL BAD.
POD1000000016_S0000099	SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE SCENE. IT IS JUNE OF 1776 AND THOMAS JEFFERSON
POD1000000016_S0000100	AT THE VERY YOUNG AGE OF 33 YEARS OLD, HAS BEEN TASKED WITH DRAFTING THE DOCUMENT THAT IS GOING TO DECLARE TO THE WORLD WHY THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES, THE 13 COLONIES, WANT TO BREAK OFF FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
POD1000000016_S0000101	HE GOES TO PHILADELPHIA AND RENTS TWO ROOMS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ALONG THE RIVER AND SITS DOWN TO DRAFT WHAT WE ALL KNOW NOW AS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
POD1000000016_S0000102	WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR ONE PEOPLE TO DISSOLVE THE POLITICAL BANDS WHICH HAVE CONNECTED THEM WITH ANOTHER.
POD1000000016_S0000104	SO HE'S SITTING AT THIS PORTABLE MAHOGANY WRITING DESK THAT HE CARRIES WITH HIM, AND HE PULLS OUT SOME PAPER AND A VERY NICE QUILL PEN.
POD1000000016_S0000105	AND HE STARTS TO WRITE THESE WORDS THAT ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN CAN RECITE BY HEART.
POD1000000016_S0000106	DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT.
POD1000000016_S0000108	THEY BECOME SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
POD1000000016_S0000109	THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN
POD1000000016_S0000111	LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONG. THE SHARED VALUES THAT WE ALL HOLD SO DEAR.
POD1000000016_S0000113	BUT WHAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T KNOW IS THAT WHILE HE'S WRITING THESE LOFTY WORDS FOR LIBERATION,
POD1000000016_S0000114	HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM ONE OF THE MANY ENSLAVED PEOPLE WHOM HE OWNED IN ORDER TO SERVE HIM AND TO KEEP HIM COMFORTABLE. NOW THAT ENSLAVED PERSON WAS A TEENAGER.
POD1000000016_S0000115	AND THAT TEENAGER WAS THE HALF BROTHER OF THOMAS JEFFERSON'S WIFE. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THOMAS JEFFERSON'S FATHER IN LAW HAD CHILDREN WITH ONE OF THE WOMEN THAT HE ENSLAVED.
POD1000000016_S0000116	SO ACTUALLY, HE WAS THOMAS JEFFERSON'S BROTHER IN LAW. AND SO AS HE'S WRITING THESE IDEALS, HE KNOWS THAT THEY WILL NOT APPLY EVEN TO HIS OWN FAMILY MEMBERS.
POD1000000016_S0000118	AT THE TIME THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON IS DRAFTING THE DECLARATION, 150 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THOSE FIRST AFRICANS WERE SOLD INTO VIRGINIA.
POD1000000016_S0000119	THE ENSLAVED POPULATION HAS GROWN FROM 20 TO NOW 500,000 PEOPLE. FULLY ONE FIFTH OF THE POPULATION IS NOW ENSLAVED.
POD1000000016_S0000120	IT HAS GROWN FROM A CONDITIONAL INSTITUTION WHERE SOME OF THOSE FIRST 20 WERE ABLE TO BECOME FREE AFTER A TERM OF TIME TO ONE WHERE BLACK PEOPLE ARE BORN INTO IT.
POD1000000016_S0000121	THEY DIE INTO IT AND THEY PASS THAT STATUS ON TO THEIR CHILDREN. YOU NOW HAVE GENERATIONS OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN A DAY OF FREEDOM AND WHO WILL NEVER KNOW A DAY OF FREEDOM.
POD1000000016_S0000122	AND YET, WHEN THOMAS JEFFERSON'S CONTEMPORARIES TALK IN PUBLIC ABOUT WHY THE COLONISTS NEED TO BE FREE FROM ENGLAND, THEY REFER TO THEMSELVES AS SLAVES.
POD1000000016_S0000123	AS SLAVES TO THE KING OF ENGLAND. AND SO THE COLONISTS ARE BEING CRITICIZED IN NEWSPAPERS FOR THIS OBVIOUS DUPLICITY BY THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BREAK OFF FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
POD1000000016_S0000124	ONE OF THEM WRITES, HOW IS IT THAT WE HEAR THE LOUDEST YELPS FOR FREEDOM FROM THE DRIVERS OF NEGROES? ANOTHER WRITES TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND SAYS, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ENSLAVED WHAT SLAVERY IS LIKE.
POD1000000016_S0000125	THOMAS JEFFERSON, OF COURSE, IS DEEPLY AWARE OF THE HYPOCRISY AND AWARE OF THE CRITICISM OF THE HYPOCRISY. SO AS HE'S DRAFTING THE DECLARATION,
POD1000000016_S0000126	HE INCLUDES A PASSAGE IN THERE WHERE HE ACTUALLY BLAMES THE KING OF ENGLAND FOR INTRODUCING SLAVERY INTO THE COLONIES. HE CALLS SLAVERY A CRIME, AND HE SAYS THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND COMMITTED THIS CRIME
POD1000000016_S0000127	BUT THAT'S NOT OUR FAULT. IT WAS NOT OUR DOING. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT THE KING OF ENGLAND DID TO WRONG US. SO HE BRINGS THIS DOCUMENT TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS
POD1000000016_S0000128	AND IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE DELEGATES FROM THE CAROLINAS AND FROM GEORGIA LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE ABOUT SLAVERY AND ONE CAN IMAGINE THEY SAID, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
POD1000000016_S0000129	AND THEY SAY THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT AS LONG AS THAT PASSAGE ABOUT SLAVERY REMAINS. AND SO IT IS STRUCK. AND THE 13 COLONIES SIGN THE DECLARATION.
POD1000000016_S0000130	AND THE DECLARATION GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD WITHOUT MENTIONING SLAVERY AT ALL, AND WE START THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
POD1000000016_S0000132	SOMEHOW, MIRACULOUSLY, THESE 13 SCRAPPY COLONIES MANAGED TO DEFEAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL EMPIRES IN THE WORLD, AND WE BECOME A NEW NATION.
POD1000000016_S0000133	AND SO THE COLONISTS GATHER AND THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE IN THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT THAT WE OF COURSE COME TO KNOW AS THE CONSTITUTION. BUT NOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.
POD1000000016_S0000134	THEY WERE TRYING TO LEAVE BEHIND AN OLD COUNTRY THAT THEY BELIEVED WAS ANTITHETICAL TO FREEDOM AND CREATE A NEW ONE THAT THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE DEFINED BY FREEDOM.
POD1000000016_S0000135	THIS WAS A COUNTRY THAT WAS GOING TO BE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, ON A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE, AND BY THE PEOPLE.
POD1000000016_S0000136	BUT THIS WAS ALSO A PLACE THAT AT THIS TIME WAS STILL PRACTICING THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY.
POD1000000016_S0000137	AND SO THE COLONISTS HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. ARE THEY GOING TO BE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR IDEALS, THE IDEALS THAT THEY WERE PUTTING TO PAPER, A COUNTRY BASED ON THE IDEA THAT ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL?
POD1000000016_S0000138	AND IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE THAT COUNTRY, THEN THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO ABOLISH THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY. OR WERE THEY GOING TO BE WEDDED TO THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO HEAVILY ON THE WEALTH THAT WAS BEING GENERATED FROM IT?
POD1000000016_S0000139	AND IN THAT CASE, THEY CAN'T REALLY WRITE THE DOCUMENT THAT THEY WANT TO WRITE. AND SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
POD1000000016_S0000140	AND THEY BAKE THAT CONTRADICTION RIGHT INTO THE CONSTITUTION, BOTH CODIFYING AND PROTECTING THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY, BUT NEVER ACTUALLY MENTIONING THE WORD.
POD1000000016_S0000141	AND SO THEY HAVE WRITTEN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST RADICAL CONSTITUTION IN THE WORLD. AND FROM THE BEGINNING, THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO VIOLATE ITS MOST ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES.
POD1000000016_S0000143	THEY CALL THIS NEW COUNTRY A DEMOCRACY. BUT IT WASN'T ONE. NOT YET.
POD1000000016_S0000145	ON AUGUST 14, 1862, ABRAHAM LINCOLN INVITES FIVE FREE BLACK MEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MEETING.
POD1000000016_S0000146	THEY ARE PART OF THE BLACK ELITE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND HE WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM.
POD1000000016_S0000147	THE CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT A YEAR, AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS WORRIED BECAUSE THE WAR IS NOT GOING WELL. AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING WELL, HE'S FEELING LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC.
POD1000000016_S0000148	HE'S CONSIDERING TAKING THIS VERY RADICAL STEP OF LIBERATING ALL OF THE ENSLAVED PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE CONFEDERATE STATES.
POD1000000016_S0000149	AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS AS A WAR TACTIC, UNDERSTANDING THAT IF HE TAKES AWAY THE SOUTH'S LABOR FORCE, THAT MIGHT CRIPPLE THEM, OR AT LEAST THE THREAT OF IT WOULD FORCE THEM TO REMAIN IN THE UNION.
POD1000000016_S0000150	BUT HE'S ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN TO SUDDENLY FREE 4 MILLION ENSLAVED PEOPLE, AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT MIGHT BE.
POD1000000016_S0000152	I CAN IMAGINE THESE FIVE DISTINGUISHED MEN ARE VERY EXCITED TO GET LINCOLN'S INVITATION. THEY ARE ABOLITIONISTS. THEY HAVE BEEN PRESSURING LINCOLN TO ABOLISH SLAVERY.
POD1000000016_S0000153	BUT WHEN THEY GET THERE, THEY ARE GREETED BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN AND ANOTHER MAN. HIS NAME IS JAMES MITCHELL. NOW, JAMES MITCHELL IS A NEW EMPLOYEE. HE'S ONLY BEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
POD1000000016_S0000154	AND HIS JOB IS A NEW JOB, AND IT'S CALLED COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION. NOW THAT'S IMMIGRATION WITH AN E, MEANING HIS JOB WAS NOT TO HELP PEOPLE TO ENTER THE COUNTRY, BUT TO HELP PEOPLE TO EXIT IT.
POD1000000016_S0000156	LINCOLN DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME, ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS THAT RECOUNT WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY.
POD1000000016_S0000158	HE TELLS THE MEN THAT HE HAD GOTTEN FUNDS FROM CONGRESS TO SHIP BLACK PEOPLE, ONCE THEY HAD BEEN FREED, TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY.
POD1000000016_S0000160	AND THEN LINCOLN SAID, YOU AND WE ARE DIFFERENT RACES. YOUR RACE SUFFER VERY GREATLY, MANY OF THEM, BY LIVING AMONGST US, WHILE OURS SUFFER FROM YOUR PRESENCE.
POD1000000016_S0000161	IN A WORD, HE SAID, WE SUFFER ON EACH SIDE.
POD1000000016_S0000163	WE ARE TAUGHT TO THINK OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR, AND HE WAS. BUT THE TRUTH IS, LIKE MANY WHITE AMERICANS, HE WAS OPPOSED TO SLAVERY BECAUSE IT WAS A CRUEL AND UNJUST INSTITUTION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS NATION'S IDEALS.
POD1000000016_S0000164	BUT HE WAS ALSO OPPOSED TO BLACK POLITICAL AND SOCIAL EQUALITY. AS HE SAID IN A SPEECH THAT HE GAVE IN 1853, HE CONSIDERED BLACK PEOPLE A, QUOTE, TROUBLESOME PRESENCE,
POD1000000016_S0000165	AND THAT THEY WERE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A DEMOCRACY THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR WHITE PEOPLE. AS HE SAID IN THAT SPEECH,
POD1000000016_S0000166	WE WELL KNOW THAT THOSE OF THE GREAT MASS OF WHITE PEOPLE WILL NOT.
POD1000000016_S0000168	AS THOSE FIVE BLACK MEN STOOD IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I WONDER WHAT IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE.
POD1000000016_S0000170	THESE MEN HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE LIBERATIONS OF MILLIONS AND HAD WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT, ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT ONCE THEY WERE GRANTED THEIR FREEDOM, THEY WERE GOING TO BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH.
POD1000000016_S0000172	AND TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE, LINCOLN THEN TELLS THEM THAT IT'S THEIR FAULT THAT THE COUNTRY IS FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR AT ALL.
POD1000000016_S0000173	HE SAYS,
POD1000000016_S0000174	THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT SAID, IT IS BETTER FOR US BOTH, THEREFORE, TO BE SEPARATED.
POD1000000016_S0000176	SO LINCOLN ENDS THE MEETING AND ONE OF THE MEN TELLS HIM THAT THEY WILL GO BACK AND CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL. LINCOLN THEN TELLS THEM, TAKE YOUR FULL TIME, NO HURRY AT ALL.
POD1000000016_S0000178	AFTER THAT MEETING, THOSE MEN MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN TAKING LINCOLN UP ON HIS OFFER TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH.
POD1000000016_S0000180	THERE'S A QUOTE BY A DIFFERENT GROUP OF BLACK ABOLITIONISTS THAT REALLY SUMS UP THE WAY THAT MOST BLACK AMERICANS FELT. AND THAT QUOTE SAID, THIS IS OUR HOME AND THIS IS OUR COUNTRY.
POD1000000016_S0000181	BENEATH ITS SIDE LIE THE BONES OF OUR FATHERS. HERE WE WERE BORN, AND HERE WE WILL DIE.
POD1000000016_S0000183	AFTER EVERYTHING THAT BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT THEY DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE UP LINCOLN'S OFFER AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START OVER, IS REALLY AN ASTOUNDING TESTIMONY TO THEIR BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN IDEALS.
POD1000000016_S0000185	BY CHOOSING TO STAY, BLACK PEOPLE WERE SAYING, THIS IS OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE AMERICAN. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK TO MAKE THESE FOUNDING IDEALS A REALITY.
POD1000000016_S0000187	AND IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED, AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDS, A VERY SHORT PERIOD CALLED RECONSTRUCTION BEGAN.
POD1000000016_S0000189	AND SO YOU SEE THE FORMERLY ENSLAVED PUSHING THEIR WHITE ALLIES IN CONGRESS TO START TO CHANGE OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENT AND TO ACTUALLY RESOLVE THOSE CONTRADICTIONS THAT WERE BAKED IN.
POD1000000016_S0000190	THEY DO THIS THROUGH GETTING AMENDMENTS PASSED. AND OF COURSE, AMENDMENTS ARE THE WAY THAT WE CHANGE OUR CONSTITUTION.
POD1000000016_S0000192	SO, OF COURSE, THE VERY FIRST AMENDMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO PASS IS THE 13TH AMENDMENT, WHICH ABOLISHES THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY.
POD1000000016_S0000193	AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT THE WORD SLAVERY IS MENTIONED IN THE CONSTITUTION, IS IN THE AMENDMENT THAT FINALLY ABOLISHES IT.
POD1000000016_S0000195	IT ALSO ENSURES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE LAWS CANNOT TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR RACE. THIS IS CALLED THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE.
POD1000000016_S0000196	AND THIS CLAUSE WILL BE USED AGAIN AND AGAIN, REALLY ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL NOW, TO GUARANTEE THAT ALL AMERICANS ARE TREATED AS EQUAL CITIZENS.
POD1000000016_S0000198	AND FINALLY, THEY PASSED THE 15TH AMENDMENT, WHICH PROBABLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AMENDMENT WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING WHAT A DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE. THE 15TH AMENDMENT GUARANTEED THE RIGHT TO VOTE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE IS.
POD1000000016_S0000199	NOW, IT DIDN'T INCLUDE WOMEN AT THAT TIME, BUT IT CERTAINLY SET THE STAGE. AND IT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, GUARANTEED THAT WHETHER YOU WERE BORN A PERSON WHO WAS ENSLAVED, WHETHER YOU'RE WHITE OR YOU WERE BLACK, YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE YOUR VOTE IN THIS DEMOCRACY.
POD1000000016_S0000201	THE ONLY REASON WE SAW ALL OF THESE GAINS IN THE SOUTH WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE FEDERAL TROOPS THERE, AND THOSE FEDERAL TROOPS WERE HOLDING BACK THE VIOLENCE OF WHITE SOUTHERNERS WHO WERE NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING THESE GAINS.
POD1000000016_S0000202	THIS ALL CHANGES WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1876.
POD1000000016_S0000204	IT WAS A CONTESTED ELECTION, AND RUTHERFORD B. HAYES IS THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. AND REMEMBER, BACK THEN, IT WAS REPUBLICANS WHO WERE THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY, AND THEY WERE THE PARTY OF LINCOLN THAT WAS WORKING TO PASS ALL OF THIS PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION.
POD1000000016_S0000206	BUT RUTHERFORD B. HAYES REALLY WANTS TO WIN THIS ELECTION.
POD1000000016_S0000207	AND SO HE MAKES A DEAL WITH THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS THAT IF THEY GIVE HIM THEIR ELECTORAL VOTES, HE WILL WITHDRAW THE FEDERAL TROOPS FROM THE SOUTH AND END RECONSTRUCTION.
POD1000000016_S0000209	SO HE MAKES THE DEAL AND THE TROOPS LEAVE AND WE IMMEDIATELY SEE WHITE SOUTHERNERS IMPLEMENT A CAMPAIGN TO FORCE BLACK PEOPLE BACK INTO THE POSITION THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN BEFORE RECONSTRUCTION.
POD1000000016_S0000211	THE SUPPRESSION OF BLACK LIFE OVER THE NEXT FIVE DECADES WOULD BE SO DEVASTATING THAT IT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE GREAT NADIR, THE SECOND SLAVERY.
POD1000000016_S0000213	TELL YOU THE TRUTH, WHEN I THINK OF IT TODAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW I AM LIVING. I AM THE OLDEST ONE THAT I KNOW THAT'S LIVING. BUT STILL I AM THANKFUL TO THE LORD.
POD1000000016_S0000215	BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FREE, THEY ARE ALL FOR THANKS.
POD1000000016_S0000217	IF I THOUGHT THAT I'D EVER BE A SLAVE AGAIN, I'D TAKE A GUN AND JUST END IT ALL RIGHT AWAY. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A DOG.
POD1000000016_S0000219	NARA SAMBHARBHA.
POD1000000016_S0000221	THE DAY OF DAYS FOR AMERICA AND HER ALLIES. CROWDS BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE AWAIT THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
POD1000000016_S0000222	I HAVE RECEIVED THIS AFTERNOON A MESSAGE FROM THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH SPECIFIES THE UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER OF JAPAN.
POD1000000016_S0000223	REPORTERS RUSH OUT TO RELAY THE NEWS TO AN ANXIOUS WORLD AND TOUCH OFF CELEBRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. JOY IS UNCONFINED.
POD1000000016_S0000225	IT'S FEBRUARY OF 1946 AND A YOUNG BLACK MAN IS SITTING ON A BUS WATCHING THE GEORGIA PINES FLY PAST THE WINDOWS. HE'S ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS WIFE AND HE'S PROBABLY VERY EXCITED BECAUSE HE'S BEEN AWAY AT WAR AND HE HASN'T SEEN HER IN A VERY LONG TIME.
POD1000000016_S0000226	HE'D BEEN FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY IN WORLD WAR II, AND JUST THAT DAY, HE'D BEEN HONORABLY DISCHARGED FOR HIS SERVICE. BUT HE IS A BLACK MAN WHO IS RETURNING TO THE JIM CROW SOUTH.
POD1000000016_S0000228	WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY IS A STORY THAT WILL BE TOLD ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
POD1000000016_S0000229	GOOD MORNING, THIS IS ORSON WELLES SPEAKING. I'D LIKE TO READ YOU AN AFFIDAVIT.
POD1000000016_S0000230	IT WAS A STORY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY.
POD1000000016_S0000232	HE'S RIDING THE BUS THROUGH GEORGIA.
POD1000000016_S0000234	HE WANTS TO GET OFF AND USE THE RESTROOM.
POD1000000016_S0000236	THE BUS DRIVER GETS UPSET WITH HIM AND THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ARGUMENT. PORTER DOESN'T THINK MUCH OF IT. HE GOES TO THE BATHROOM, RUNS BACK TO THE BUS, AND THE BUS KEEPS GOING. BUT THEN A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD, THE BUS STOPS.
POD1000000016_S0000237	AND THE BUS DRIVER GETS OFF THE BUS AND THEN CALLS AND TELLS WOODARD THAT HE NEEDS TO GET OFF THE BUS AS WELL. SO WOODARD GETS OFF THE BUS AND BEFORE HE CAN EVEN UTTER A WORD,
POD1000000016_S0000239	HE'S STRUCK IN THE HEAD BY A POLICE OFFICER.
POD1000000016_S0000241	AND THE BLOWS KEEP COMING, AND THEY KEEP COMING TO THE POINT THAT WATER LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS.
POD1000000016_S0000243	WOODARD IS STILL WEARING HIS CRISP ARMY UNIFORM. HE'S BEEN DISCHARGED JUST A FEW HOURS EARLIER. WHEN HE COMES TO, HE'S IN A JAIL.
POD1000000016_S0000245	I WOKE UP NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT SEE.
POD1000000016_S0000246	HE WAS BEATEN SO SEVERELY BY THAT POLICE OFFICER THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN.
POD1000000016_S0000248	SO WATERS BEATING WAS NOT AT ALL UNUSUAL. WORLD WAR II HAD DONE EXACTLY WHAT MANY WHITE PEOPLE HAD FEARED.
POD1000000016_S0000249	THAT ONCE BLACK PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO FIGHT IN THE MILITARY AND WHEN THEY TRAVELED ABROAD AND THEY EXPERIENCED WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOT TO LIVE UNDER A SYSTEM OF RACIAL APARTHEID, THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER TO CONTROL THEM WHEN THEY CAME BACK.
POD1000000016_S0000250	BLACK MEN IN THEIR UNIFORMS WERE SEEN AS BEING UNDULY PROUD. SO THESE MEN WHO HAD SERVED THEIR COUNTRY, WHO WOULD COME HOME PROUDLY WEARING THE UNIFORM TO SHOW THEIR SERVICE FOR THEIR COUNTRY.
POD1000000016_S0000251	WOULD FIND THAT THIS ACTUALLY MADE THEM A TARGET OF SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE VIOLENCE. BUT WHAT WAS UNUSUAL WAS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER. WODARD'S CASE WAS PICKED UP BY THE NAACP, AND THEY TAKE HIM ON A BIT OF A TOUR.
POD1000000016_S0000252	WHERE THEY'RE SAYING, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS MAN WHO SERVED HIS COUNTRY.
POD1000000016_S0000254	AND THAT'S LARGELY SEEN AS ONE OF THE SPARKS OF THE MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
POD1000000016_S0000256	THE SECOND SUSTAINED MOVEMENT OF BLACK PEOPLE TRYING TO SECURE EQUAL RIGHTS BEFORE THE LAW AND AN EQUAL PLACE IN THIS DEMOCRACY.
POD1000000016_S0000258	AND IN 1968, 350 YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FIRST ENSLAVED AFRICANS INTO THE COLONIES,
POD1000000016_S0000260	CONGRESS PASSES THE LAST OF THE GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION.
POD1000000016_S0000262	IT ENDS LEGAL DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE FROM ALL ASPECTS OF AMERICAN LIFE.
POD1000000016_S0000264	WE OFTEN THINK OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS BEING ABOUT BLACK RIGHTS. BUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS NEVER JUST ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF BLACK PEOPLE. IT WAS ABOUT MAKING THE IDEALS OF THE CONSTITUTION WHOLE.
POD1000000016_S0000265	AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAWS BORN OUT OF BLACK RESISTANCE, THESE LAWS ARE GUARANTEEING RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS.
POD1000000016_S0000266	THIS EXPERIENCE, WHICH BLACK AMERICANS WERE HAVING, DID NOT GO UNNOTICED BY THE REST OF AMERICA.
POD1000000016_S0000267	I MEAN, BASICALLY EVERY OTHER RIGHTS STRUGGLE THAT WE HAVE SEEN.
POD1000000016_S0000269	DISABILITY RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
POD1000000016_S0000270	THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WERE STILL VICTIMS OF SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION.
POD1000000016_S0000271	ALL COME FROM THE EFFORTS OF THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLES.
POD1000000016_S0000274	SO WE ARE RAISED TO THINK ABOUT 1776 AS THE BEGINNING OF OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT WHEN THAT SHIP ARRIVES ON THE HORIZON AT POINT COMFORT IN 1619,
POD1000000016_S0000275	THAT DECISION MADE BY THE COLONISTS TO PURCHASE THAT GROUP OF 20 TO 30 HUMAN BEINGS, THAT WAS A BEGINNING TOO.
POD1000000016_S0000276	AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THOSE VERY PEOPLE WHO WERE DENIED CITIZENSHIP IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY, WHO WERE DENIED THE PROTECTIONS OF OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS, WHO WOULD FIGHT THE HARDEST AND MOST SUCCESSFULLY TO MAKE THOSE IDEALS REAL.
POD1000000016_S0000277	NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES, BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS. IT IS BLACK PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THE PERFECTORS OF THIS DEMOCRACY.
POD1000000016_S0000279	WHEN I WAS A KID, I MUST HAVE BEEN IN FIFTH OR SIXTH GRADE, OUR TEACHER GAVE US AN ASSIGNMENT. IT WAS A SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS AND WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT PLACES THAT PEOPLE CAME FROM.
POD1000000016_S0000280	AND THIS WAS HER WAY OF KIND OF TELLING THE STORY OF THE GREAT AMERICAN MELTING POT. SO SHE TOLD US ALL TO RESEARCH OUR ANCESTRAL LAND AND TO WRITE A SMALL REPORT ABOUT IT AND THEN TO DRAW A FLAG.
POD1000000016_S0000281	I REMEMBER KIND OF LOOKING UP AND MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH THE OTHER BLACK GIRL WHO WAS IN THE CLASS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE AN ANCESTRAL LAND THAT WE KNEW OF.
POD1000000016_S0000282	SLAVERY HAD MADE IT SO THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE CAME FROM IN AFRICA. WE DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC COUNTRY, AND WE COULD SAY THAT WE WERE FROM THE WHOLE CONTINENT.
POD1000000016_S0000283	BUT EVEN SO, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN AFRICAN FLAG. AND SO I REMEMBER GOING TO THE GLOBE BY MY TEACHER'S DESK. IT WAS ON THE WINDOW PANE ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CLASSROOM.
POD1000000016_S0000284	AND SPINNING IT TO THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA AND JUST PICKING A RANDOM AFRICAN COUNTRY.
POD1000000016_S0000285	SO I WENT BACK TO MY DESK AND I DREW THAT RANDOM AFRICAN COUNTRIES FLAG AND I WROTE A REPORT ABOUT IT. AND I FELT ASHAMED. I FELT ASHAMED, ONE, BECAUSE I WAS LYING.
POD1000000016_S0000286	BUT I ALSO FELT ASHAMED BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I SHOULD HAVE SOME OTHER COUNTRY AND THAT ALL THE OTHER KIDS COULD TRACE THEIR ROOTS ELSEWHERE AND I COULD ONLY TRACE MY ROOTS TO THE COUNTRY THAT HAD ENSLAVED US.
POD1000000016_S0000287	I WISH NOW THAT I COULD GO BACK AND TALK TO MY YOUNGER SELF AND TELL HER THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED.
POD1000000016_S0000288	THAT THIS IS HER ANCESTRAL HOME. THAT SHE SHOULD BE AS PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN AS HER DAD WAS.
POD1000000016_S0000289	AND THAT SHE SHOULD BOLDLY AND PROUDLY DRAW THOSE STARS AND STRIPES AND CLAIM THIS COUNTRY AS HER OWN.
POD1000000019_S0000000	THIS EPISODE OF COCAINE AND RHINESTONES IS THE SECOND EPISODE IN A THREE PART SERIES ON HARPER VALLEY PTA.
POD1000000019_S0000001	IF THIS IS THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE PODCAST YOU ARE LISTENING TO, I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING BACK AND AT LEAST LISTENING TO LAST WEEK'S EPISODE BEFORE THIS ONE, EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST A HUGE GENIE C. REILLY FAN AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO SHELBY SINGLETON IS.
POD1000000019_S0000002	IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD LAST WEEK'S EPISODE, YOU'LL BE MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF CONTEXT, AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE DOING VERY MUCH RECAPPING.
POD1000000019_S0000004	LAST WEEK WE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING AT HOW FAR OUTSIDE OF THE BOX SHELBY SINGLETON WAS WILLING TO GO FOR A HIT SONG. NOW ARE WE SURE WE KNOW WHAT A HIT SONG IS? HOW TO DEFINE IT?
POD1000000019_S0000006	IT'S SAFE TO SAY ANY SONG THAT HITS THE TOP 10 COULD BE CALLED A HIT, RIGHT? OKAY, THIS PAST MAY, WHEN I BEGAN WORKING ON THIS PODCAST, I SPENT ABOUT A WEEK LISTENING TO EVERY SONG TO EVER GO NUMBER ONE ON THE BILLBOARD COUNTRY CHART.
POD1000000019_S0000007	IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER FROM THE FIRST YEAR THE CHART EXISTED IN 1944 UNTIL THIS SHOW'S CUTOFF POINT IN THE YEAR 2000.
POD1000000019_S0000008	I NEEDED TO MAKE SURE I'D HEARD THEM ALL TO BUILD A TIMELINE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MAINSTREAM OF COUNTRY MUSIC IN THE 1900S. THERE WERE QUITE A FEW SONGS I'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE.
POD1000000019_S0000009	UNLESS YOU'VE PURPOSEFULLY SAT DOWN TO GIVE YOURSELF THE SAME EXPERIENCE OR SPENT THE PAST 70 SOMETHING YEARS OF YOUR LIFE GLUED TO COUNTRY RADIO, THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR YOU. NUMBER 1 SONGS, HIT SONGS, COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF COUNTRY MUSIC.
POD1000000019_S0000010	EVEN WHEN THE SONG AT NUMBER ONE THE WEEK BEFORE OR THE WEEK AFTER IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE SONGS OF ALL TIME. NOW IMAGINE HOW MANY TOP 10 HITS BETWEEN 1944 AND THE YEAR 2000 WE HAVEN'T HEARD.
POD1000000019_S0000011	PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF HIT COUNTRY SONGS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE I'VE NEVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. SO WE CAN SAY ALL HITS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL. NOT IN THE MIND OF THE AUDIENCE AND DEFINITELY NOT IN THE MIND OF THE RECORD INDUSTRY.
POD1000000019_S0000012	I SHOULD GIVE A DISCLAIMER HERE THAT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERYTHING. OBVIOUSLY NOT A GAUGE OF ARTISTIC MERIT.
POD1000000019_S0000013	THERE ARE BRILLIANT COUNTRY ARTISTS WHO'VE NEVER HAD A HIT IN THEIR LIVES. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.
POD1000000019_S0000014	BUT IF WE'RE SAYING TOP 10 SINGLES ARE HITS, AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SAY THAT, THEN JUST HAVING HITS WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THIS INDUSTRY. YOU HAD TO HAVE MORE HITS. BIGGER HITS. IT WAS CALLED THE RECORD INDUSTRY.
POD1000000019_S0000015	MOVE UNITS, MAKE MONEY, OR GET OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE NEXT ARTIST WHO WILL. ALWAYS BE SCALING UP. ANYTHING THAT ISN'T AS GOOD AS OR BETTER THAN THE LAST THING YOU DID
POD1000000019_S0000016	YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE NOT DONE IT. AND YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP WISHING YOU HADN'T.
POD1000000019_S0000017	I THINK THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO A COUNTRY RECORDING ARTIST IN THIS CLIMATE IS FOR THEIR VERY FIRST SINGLE TO BECOME A NUMBER ONE HIT. YOU CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THAT. THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE ON THAT IS TO STAY NUMBER ONE FOR MORE WEEKS.
POD1000000019_S0000018	SELL MORE COPIES. EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO DO THAT, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL YOU PUT OUT A SONG THAT ONLY GOES TO NUMBER TWO OR NUMBER FIVE.
POD1000000019_S0000019	BUT THAT'S STILL A HIT. OH SURE, SURE IT IS. OR MAYBE IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END. MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE STUFF ANYMORE, KIDDO. WE GOTTA GET THOSE NUMBERS BACK UP TO WHERE THEY WERE OR WELL, IT AIN'T GONNA BE GOOD.
POD1000000019_S0000020	IMAGINE YOU'RE A NEW COUNTRY ARTIST AND YOUR VERY FIRST SINGLE GOES NUMBER ONE COUNTRY AND POP. HOW SCREWED DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? THERE AREN'T MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN ASK ABOUT THIS.
POD1000000019_S0000021	BILLY SWAN IS ONE. GENIE C. REILLY, THE SINGER OF HARPER VALLEY PTA, IS THE OTHER ONE. THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE ALIVE WHO'VE HAD THEIR FIRST SINGLE GO NUMBER ONE COUNTRY AND POP.
POD1000000019_S0000022	NEITHER ONE OF THEM EVER HAD ANOTHER NUMBER ONE SONG.
POD1000000019_S0000024	I'VE HEARD THEM BOTH CALLED ONE HIT WONDERS.
POD1000000019_S0000025	BILLY SWAN NEVER EVEN GOT BACK IN THE TOP 10. ALTHOUGH HE DID ALSO WRITE HIS ONE HIT, I CAN HELP, AND ELVIS PRESLEY RECORDED THAT, SO I ASSUME BILLY'S DOING FINE.
POD1000000019_S0000027	GENIE C. RILEY PUT OUT 5 MORE TOP 10 HITS, 4 OF WHICH CROSSED OVER INTO THE BILLBOARD HOT 100. THESE ARE COUNTRY SONGS BY THE WAY.
POD1000000019_S0000028	NONE OF THAT STRIPPED DOWN NASHVILLE SOUND STUFF THE INDUSTRY BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO PUSH IT POP AUDIENCES. GENIE WAS ACHIEVING CROSSOVER SUCCESS WITH ONE OF THE MOST UNSOPHISTICATED TEXAS TWANGS YOU'VE EVER HEARD.
POD1000000019_S0000029	AND A HARDCORE COUNTRY SOUND BEHIND IT. THAT'S NOT WHAT ONE HIT WONDERS DO.
POD1000000019_S0000031	BUT BECAUSE HER FIRST SINGLE SOLD MAYBE 6 MILLION RECORDS
POD1000000019_S0000032	NOTHING SHE DID AFTER THAT MATTERED.
POD1000000019_S0000034	JEANNIE CAROLYN STEVENSON WAS BORN IN A SMALL TEXAS TOWN IN 1945. IN 1962, WHILE STILL A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, SHE MARRIED HER BOYFRIEND, MICKEY RILEY, AND BECAME JEANNIE CAROLYN RILEY. SO, C STANDS FOR CAROLYN.
POD1000000019_S0000035	HER UNCLE WAS A COUNTRY GUITAR PLAYER AND SONGWRITER. NOBODY YOU'D KNOW, BUT IN THE TINY TOWN OF ANSON, TEXAS, JUST THE FACT THAT HE'D GONE TO NASHVILLE TO RECORD IN A REAL STUDIO WAS A BIG DEAL.
POD1000000019_S0000036	OR AT LEAST JEANNIE SEEMS TO THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT SO. HER HUSBAND MICKEY KNEW IT WAS JEANNIE'S DREAM TO MOVE TO NASHVILLE AND BECOME A FAMOUS SINGER. HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.
POD1000000019_S0000037	BUT THEY DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL JEANNIE FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL AND SAVE SOME MONEY FOR THE MOVE. THEN JEANNIE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT AND THEY HAD A BABY. IN 1966.
POD1000000019_S0000038	YES, THAT IS FOUR YEARS AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED. AND UNLESS IT TOOK JEANNIE FOUR YEARS TO PASS 12TH GRADE, THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP AT ALL FOR HER TO USE THE BABY AS AN EXCUSE FOR WHY THEY STAYED IN TEXAS. I'LL GET TO IT IN A SECOND.
POD1000000019_S0000040	ONE DAY, JEANNIE SAYS, SHE GETS A LETTER FROM THE GREAT PEDAL STEEL PLAYER WELDON MYRICK, WHO'D SEEN HER SING AT A LOCAL JAMBOREE AND JUST HAD TO WRITE HER TO SAY THAT HE THOUGHT OF JEANNIE'S SINGING EVERY TIME HE HEARD CONNIE SMITH SING.
POD1000000019_S0000041	ONCE A DAY.
POD1000000019_S0000043	NOW, IN JUST A MINUTE, YOU MAY DECIDE JEANNIE'S MAKING THIS PART UP, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT'S TRUE. LATER, YOU'LL HEAR SHE WAS ABLE TO SING IN A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR STYLE TO CONNIE SMITH. SO WELDON'S LETTER GIVES HER A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT.
POD1000000019_S0000044	THE NEXT TIME UNCLE JOHNNY GOES TO NASHVILLE, HE INVITES THE ENTIRE FAMILY ON THE TRIP AND THEY GO. STILL IN 1966 HERE, 13 PEOPLE PILE INTO TWO CARS TO MAKE THE TRIP.
POD1000000019_S0000045	UP IN NASHVILLE, THEY DRIVE AROUND LOWER BROADWAY TO LOOK AT TOOTSIE'S ORCHID LOUNGE, ERNEST HUBS RECORD SHOP, AND THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM. ALL THAT COUNTRY MUSIC TOURIST STUFF.
POD1000000019_S0000046	UNCLE JOHNNY GETS THEM BACKSTAGE AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY AND JEANNIE'S ALL STARSTRUCK. SHE GETS AN AUTOGRAPH FROM CONNIE SMITH. JACKIE PHELPS, THE GUY YOU'D LATER SEE PLAYING GUITAR ON HAW, TAKES UNCLE JOHNNY ASIDE TO GIVE HIM SOME ADVICE.
POD1000000019_S0000047	YOUR LITTLE NIECE IS A PRETTY COUNTRY GIRL AND I'D LIKE TO SAVE HER AND HER HUSBAND SOME HEARTACHE. IF SHE'S GOT TALENT, TELL HER SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SELL HER BODY TO MAKE IT TO THE TOP. SHE CAN MAKE IT IF SHE KNOWS THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
POD1000000019_S0000048	BUT IF SHE GETS IN WITH THE WRONG CROWD, THEY'LL DESTROY HER AND HER HOME TOO.
POD1000000019_S0000049	YOU'RE LISTENING TO COCAINE AND RHINESTONES, THE PODCAST ABOUT 20TH CENTURY COUNTRY MUSIC AND THE LIES OF THOSE WHO GAVE IT TO US.
POD1000000019_S0000050	MY NAME IS TYLER MAHAN CO. I'VE HEARD THESE STORIES MY WHOLE LIFE, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. OKAY, FREEZE.
POD1000000019_S0000051	GENIE C. REILLY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS REALLY THE ONLY SOURCE I CAN USE FOR THIS STUFF, AND IT'S SUPER SKETCHY TO SAY THE LEAST.
POD1000000019_S0000052	THIS IS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL OUTLANDISH SCENARIOS WHERE FAMOUS PEOPLE GIVE HER INCREDIBLY PERSONAL ADVICE THAT IS ALSO SO EXTREMELY SPECIFIC.
POD1000000019_S0000053	IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY CAN SEE INTO JEANNIE'S ACTUAL FUTURE MERE MOMENTS AFTER MEETING HER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000054	YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN. A COLLEAGUE OF YOURS BRINGS HIS NIECE TO SEE A SHOW. YOU TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO CALL THE GUY ASIDE AND TELL HIM TO MAKE SURE TO LET HIS NIECE KNOW NOT TO BE A HOOKER? NOT LIKELY.
POD1000000019_S0000055	JEANNIE DOES GO ON TO FIND HERSELF IN SOME BAD SITUATIONS AND I DON'T DOUBT FOR A SECOND THAT THEY REALLY HAPPENED. BUT BELIEVING HER ABOUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING ELSE SHE SAYS.
POD1000000019_S0000056	THERE'S ALL THESE RUN INS WITH CELEBRITIES WHO SEEM TO HAVE PSYCHIC POWERS. THE TIMELINE SHE PRESENTS OFTEN MAKES NO SENSE. FINE, BUT AT LEAST ONE MAJOR PART OF HER STORY IS DELIBERATELY MISREPRESENTED.
POD1000000019_S0000057	SHE IS BLATANTLY LYING ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS. THERE'S EVEN A NOTE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK ABOUT HOW SEVERAL NAMES AND SOME DETAILS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO PROTECT PEOPLE
POD1000000019_S0000059	BASICALLY, IT COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR THAT THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS MORE LIKE WHAT YOU'D CALL AN AUTOHAGIOGRAPHY, THE HOLLYWOOD MOVIE VERSION OF THESE EVENTS.
POD1000000019_S0000060	THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PRINTED BASED ON A TRUE STORY ON THE TITLE PAGE. I SHOULD SAY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CELEBRITY AUTOBIOGRAPHIES THAT'S WRITTEN WITH THE HELP OF AN AUTHOR. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE THIS GUY HAD A HAND IN THESE EMBELLISHMENTS.
POD1000000019_S0000061	YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND, THAT'S WHAT I'LL SAY, BUT THIS IS GONNA GET REAL CRAZY, SO JUST PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER THIS.
POD1000000019_S0000062	BUT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A SMALL TYPE OF THING THAT I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN MENTION IF I ONLY NOTICED IT ONCE OR TWICE. THE BOOK OPENS WITH HER LOCKING UP THE OFFICE BUILDING IN NASHVILLE WHERE SHE WORKED AS A SECRETARY.
POD1000000019_S0000063	WALKING OVER TO A RECORDING STUDIO AND BEING GREETED BY SHELBY SINGLETON HANDING HER THE LYRICS OF HARBOR VALLEY PTA. WE'VE GOT SHELBY SAYING, IT'S JUST RIGHT FOR YOUR VOICE. TOM HALL HAS CAUGHT THE ANGRY MOOD OF THE COUNTRY. LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE IT SING.
POD1000000019_S0000064	THE PROBLEM IS, AS YOU'LL HEAR IN A FEW MINUTES, THE ENTIRE WEEK BEFORE THIS, JEANNIE HAD BEEN ARGUING WITH EVERYONE ABOUT NOT LIKING THIS SONG AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE RELEASED UNDER HER OWN NAME OR A PSEUDONYM.
POD1000000019_S0000065	IN THE VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH, SHE SAYS SHE'D ALREADY STUDIED THE LYRICS, WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM SHELBY. WHY DOES SHE HAVE SHELBY PRESENTING THE LYRICS TO HER HERE WITH SUCH POMP, AS IF FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME?
POD1000000019_S0000066	AS IF SHE'S NEVER HEARD THIS SONG BEFORE. LIKE I SAID, SMALL THING, I WOULD LET IT SLIDE, BUT THIS IS A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS SITUATION.
POD1000000019_S0000067	THERE'S AT LEAST ONE SCENE WHERE TWO PEOPLE GO BACK AND FORTH WITH LINES OF QUOTED DIALOGUE IN A CONVERSATION THAT JEANNIE WAS NOT THERE FOR AND COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMEMBER WITH SUCH DETAIL EVEN IF SHE WAS BLESSED WITH TOTAL RECALL OVER A DECADE AFTER THE FACT.
POD1000000019_S0000069	THERE'S ONE MORE SCENE WHERE SHE'S DRIVING HER CAR WHILE UPSET, QUOTE, HALF BLIND FROM THE TEARS. SHE ACCIDENTALLY SPEEDS OVER SOME RAILROAD TRACKS JUST AHEAD OF A CROSSING TRAIN, AND I'M QUOTING HERE.
POD1000000019_S0000070	THE TRAIN LOOMED OVER ME AS I ROARED ACROSS THE TRACKS, MISSING MY BACK BUMPER BY LESS THAN A FOOT. THE VACUUM CREATED BY THE RUSHING LOCOMOTIVE AND THE RUMBLING WHEELS ALMOST FLIPPED MY CAR OVER. THE SCREECHING
POD1000000019_S0000072	HALF BLIND FROM TEARS, YET SHE KNOWS WITHIN A 12 INCH MARGIN OF ERROR HOW CLOSE A TRAIN PASSED TO THE BACK BUMPER OF HER CAR. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M WORKING WITH HERE. AND WHATEVER, YOU'LL SEE.
POD1000000019_S0000073	OKAY, WE'RE STILL IN NASHVILLE THE NIGHT JEANNIE'S UNCLE TAKES HER BACKSTAGE AT THE OPRY. WHEN THEY LEAVE THE OPRY THAT NIGHT, DOYLE WILBURN OF THE WILBURN BROTHERS HAS AGREED TO LISTEN TO JEANNIE SING
POD1000000019_S0000074	IF THEY'LL COME BY THE OFFICE OF SUREFIRE, HIS PUBLISHING COMPANY. A FEW DAYS LATER, THEY DROP IN TO THE SUREFIRE OFFICE AND MEET JOHNNY RUSSELL, WHO IS A STAFF SONGWRITER THERE. JOHNNY RUSSELL LISTENS TO HER SING,
POD1000000019_S0000075	THEY DECIDE TO HAVE HER GO IN THE STUDIO THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT TO RECORD A 4 SONG DEMO TAPE. THEY HAVE A PHOTOGRAPHER TAKE SOME PICTURES OF HER. JEANNIE THINKS ALL OF THIS MEANS SHE'S ON HER WAY TO BECOMING A STAR.
POD1000000019_S0000076	THE SECOND NIGHT OF RECORDING, WITHIN 48 HOURS OF MEETING HER, JOHNNY RUSSELL PULLS JEANNIE AND HER HUSBAND MICKEY ASIDE TO TELL THEM, QUOTE, I'VE WATCHED YOU KIDS EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE, AND I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU.
POD1000000019_S0000077	NASHVILLE IS GOOD TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE ON TOP, BUT IT'S A MEAN CITY TOO. THIS BUSINESS OF WANTING TO BE NUMBER ONE GETS IN YOUR BLOOD. IT CONSUMES YOU UNTIL YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE. IT'S LIKE DRUGS, ONLY WORSE.
POD1000000019_S0000078	BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO GET RID OF IT. YOU'LL LEAVE YOUR FAMILY. YOU'LL LEAVE YOUR SELF RESPECT. YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO REACH THE TOP AND ANYTHING TO STAY THERE.
POD1000000019_S0000079	I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN TOO MANY TIMES. MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE THE EXCEPTION. THEY COME IN HERE WITH HIGH MORALS AND HIGH IDEALS AND LOSE THEM OVERNIGHT. THE PRESSURES ARE TOO MUCH. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THIS.
POD1000000019_S0000080	I DON'T THINK JEANNIE CAN MAKE IT HERE. SHE'S GOT A GOOD VOICE AND YOU'RE A FINE YOUNG COUPLE. BUT THIS CITY WILL CHEW YOU UP, SWALLOW THE JUICE, AND SPIT YOU OUT LIKE A DRY HOLE ON THE STREET. GO BACK TO TEXAS AND STAY THERE.
POD1000000019_S0000081	WOW! THAT IS ONE HELL OF A MONOLOGUE, HUH? I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE GETS ANYTHING DONE IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS WHEN THEY'RE DELIVERING FULLY POLISHED, 150 WORD SPEECHES LIKE THAT TO EVERYONE THEY'VE KNOWN FOR 48 HOURS.
POD1000000019_S0000082	ANYWAY, AFTER A WEEK OR SO, THE TEXAS CREW HEADS BACK TO TEXAS. DOYLE WILBURN HAD TOLD THEM THE WILBURNS WOULD BE NEEDING A FEMALE VOCALIST FOR THEIR UPCOMING SEPTEMBER TOUR OF GERMANY. JEANNIE SHOULD EXPECT THEIR CALL.
POD1000000019_S0000083	ALL THROUGH JULY, SHE EXPECTS THE CALL. ALL THROUGH AUGUST, SHE EXPECTS THE CALL. OF COURSE, IT NEVER COMES. SO SHE GETS ALL BUMMED OUT UNTIL MICKEY COMES HOME FROM WORK ONE DAY AND TELLS HER TO START PACKING. HE'S SICK OF SEEING HER MOPE AROUND THE HOUSE. THEY'RE MOVING TO NASHVILLE.
POD1000000019_S0000084	AS THEY CROSS THE CITY LIMIT SIGN INTO NASHVILLE, SHE AND MICKEY MAKE A PACT THAT THEY'LL ALWAYS TRAVEL TOGETHER AS A FAMILY, THE BABY TWO. QUOTE, SHOW BUSINESS MIGHT CHEW UP OTHER FOLKS AND SPIT THEM ONTO THE SIDEWALK, BUT NOT US. WE'D SHOW THEM.
POD1000000019_S0000085	WE WERE GONNA MAKE IT TOGETHER.
POD1000000019_S0000087	THIS IS THE END OF 1966. BECAUSE OF EVERYONE JEANNIE STARTS HAVING SEX WITH AND THE FACT THAT SHE CHANGES THEIR NAMES,
POD1000000019_S0000088	AND THE NAMES OF THE COMPANIES THEY WORK FOR. IT GETS REALLY CONFUSING TO WORK OUT THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AND WHERE FOR THE NEXT YEAR.
POD1000000019_S0000089	FOR INSTANCE, SHE REFERS TO HER FIRST MANAGER, PAUL PERRY, AS PETE TERRY THROUGH HER ENTIRE BOOK BECAUSE OF THE AFFAIR SHE LATER HAS WITH HIM. THIS OTHER GUY GETS NAMED PHIL BLACKMAN, AND HE'S A BIG SHOT AT BLACK ROSE RECORDS.
POD1000000019_S0000090	BASED OUT OF NEW YORK. PHIL BLACKMAN IS OUR BIG BAD WOLF. UNCLE JOHNNY BOUGHT A GAS STATION RIGHT BEFORE JEANNIE AND MICKEY MOVED TO NASHVILLE. SO THAT'S WHERE MICKEY STARTS WORKING.
POD1000000019_S0000091	THEY LIVE IN A MOTEL ROOM, THEN A SMALL APARTMENT. JEANNIE KEEPS CALLING SUREFIRE MUSIC TO FIND OUT WHY THEY DIDN'T HIRE HER FOR THAT WILBURN BROTHERS TOUR. SHE EVENTUALLY FINDS OUT THAT TOUR WAS CANCELLED AND THEN GETS TO WORK FURTHERING HER CAREER BY CHECKING THE MAILBOX.
POD1000000019_S0000092	AND WAITING FOR THE PHONE TO RING. SHE WRITES THAT SHE SPENDS WEEKS WAITING FOR THE WORLD TO NOTICE HER, RESENTING HER HUSBAND FOR WORKING 12 HOUR DAYS AT A GAS STATION TO SUPPORT HER AND THE BABY, WHILE ALSO BEGGING HIM TO MOVE THEM TO A BIGGER APARTMENT CLOSER TO HIS WORK.
POD1000000019_S0000094	ONE DAY, SHE FINALLY REALIZES SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO ACTUALLY TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO CARE THAT SHE EXISTS. SHE GETS ALL DOLLED UP AND DRIVES WITH HER BABY DOWN TO MUSIC ROW TO LOOK FOR THIS POWERFUL WOMAN SHE'D HEARD OF WHO WAS FROM A TOWN IN TEXAS.
POD1000000019_S0000095	25 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE JEANNIE WAS FROM. SHE APPARENTLY THINKS SHE CAN MEET THIS LADY, SAY, HEY, I'M FROM TEXAS TOO, AND GET A RECORD DEAL OR SOMETHING.
POD1000000019_S0000096	SHE HAS NO IDEA WHERE THIS LADY'S OFFICE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. SHE JUST STARTS WALKING INTO PUBLISHING COMPANIES TO FIND OUT IF THAT LADY WORKS THERE OR NOT. WHEN SOME KID ASKS IF SHE'S TRYING TO GET A DEMO TAPE HEARD, JEANNIE PULLS OUT HER TAPE AND THE KID TAKES A LISTEN.
POD1000000019_S0000097	HE SEEMS TO LIKE IT, PLAYS IT FOR HIS BOSS, WHO SAYS IT SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE LORETTA LYNN, AND THEY TELL JEANNIE TO KICK ROCKS. SHE GOES BACK TO HER CAR WITH THE BABY AND CRIES, THEN DECIDES TO DRIVE OVER TO THE GAS STATION WHERE MICKEY WORKS.
POD1000000019_S0000098	WHEN SHE GETS THERE, MICKEY'S TALKING TO A GUY NAMED JERRY CHESTNUT, A RICH GUY WHO OWNS A VACUUM CLEANER BUSINESS BUT ALSO WANTS TO BE A SONGWRITER.
POD1000000019_S0000099	YOU'VE HEARD THE SONG HE'D WRITE A FEW YEARS AFTER THIS CALLED A GOOD YEAR FOR THE ROSES
POD1000000019_S0000101	MICKEY HAS A COPY OF GENIE'S DEMO TAPE THAT HE PLAYS IN THE GAS STATION JUST IN CASE SOMEONE IMPORTANT HAPPENS TO COME IN AND HEAR IT AND CARE.
POD1000000019_S0000102	CHESTNUT ISN'T REALLY IMPORTANT YET, BUT HE DID STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION AND OFFER TO PLAY THE DEMO TAPE FOR HIS FRIENDS AT MONUMENT RECORDS. A FEW DAYS LATER, HE CALLS TO SAY MONUMENT IS INTERESTED.
POD1000000019_S0000103	BUT THEY WANT TO CHANGE GENIE'S NAME, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING WELL WITH GENIE SEELIE. AND LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THE GENIES OVER HERE, RIGHT? OUR GENIE'S NOT THRILLED ABOUT THIS, BUT
POD1000000019_S0000104	BUT JERRY THINKS THEY CAN GET MONUMENT TO BACK OFF THE NAME CHANGE IF THEY STAY ON IT. JEANNIE GETS SHOWN OFF AT A DJ CONVENTION, INTRODUCED TO EVERYONE IN TOWN AS TINA STEVENS, THE NEXT GIRL THEY'RE GONNA SIGN AND DO BIG THINGS WITH.
POD1000000019_S0000105	BUT THEN SHE GETS FORGOTTEN ABOUT BECAUSE APPARENTLY A MAJOR FEMALE ARTIST ON THE LABEL DOESN'T LIKE GENIE OR TINA OR WHOEVER. BACK TO SQUARE ONE.
POD1000000019_S0000106	JERRY CHESTNUT MEETS A RADIO DJ NAMED PAUL PERRY, WHO KNOWS PHIL BLACKMAN, A MADE UP NAME FOR A REAL IMPORTANT GUY AT BLACK ROSE, WHICH IS ALSO A MADE UP NAME FOR A REAL RECORD LABEL.
POD1000000019_S0000107	REMEMBER THIS SENTENCE, THAT DJ PAUL PERRY SENDS JEANNIE'S DEMO AND A PROMO PICTURE TO PHIL BLACKMAN IN NEW YORK CITY.
POD1000000019_S0000108	BLACKMAN EXPRESSES INTEREST IN RECORDING GENIE WHEN HE COMES TO NASHVILLE SOMETIME IN JANUARY. IT ENDS UP BEING EARLY FEBRUARY OF 1967 WHEN GENIE WALKS INTO BLACK ROSE'S OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000109	SHE WRITES LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT THE CONVERSATION, ONLY THAT SHE FINDS BILL BLACKMAN VERY ATTRACTIVE AND SHE LEAVES WITH A CONTRACT. THAT NIGHT, SHE BEGINS FANTASIZING THAT BLACKMAN WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH HER.
POD1000000019_S0000110	WITHIN A WEEK, IN REALITY, THEY'VE KISSED. BLACKMAN GOES BACK TO NEW YORK CITY FOR BUSINESS. WHEN HE RETURNS A FEW WEEKS LATER, HE AND JEANNIE START HAVING A FULL FLEDGED AFFAIR.
POD1000000019_S0000111	NOW, I DON'T LIKE DWELLING ON THIS SOAP OPERA STUFF UNLESS THE STORY CANNOT BE TOLD WITHOUT IT. SO HERE'S THE RELEVANT INFORMATION. THAT DJ NAMED PAUL PERRY BECOMES GENIE'S FIRST MANAGER.
POD1000000019_S0000112	SHE TECHNICALLY GETS A SINGLE RELEASED ON BLACK ROSE RECORDS, BUT IT'S ONLY TECHNICALLY RELEASED. NO MONEY IS PUT INTO PROMOTING IT, AND NOT EVEN GENIE THINKS IT'S ANY GOOD.
POD1000000019_S0000113	BUT SHE DOES THINK SHE AND THIS RICH POWERFUL MAN ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER, SO SHE'S NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT THAT RECORD.
POD1000000019_S0000115	THEN, ONE DAY IN BLACKMAN'S APARTMENT, JEANNIE'S LAYING NAKED ON THE COUCH AFTER HAVING SEX WITH HIM WHEN SHE'S SUDDENLY BLINDED BY FLASHES OF BRIGHT LIGHT. THERE'S BLACKMAN HOLDING A CAMERA WITH A STROBE FLASH ATTACHMENT.
POD1000000019_S0000116	GENIE FREAKS OUT. HE TELLS HER THERE'S NO FILM IN THE CAMERA. SHE ASKS IF HE REALLY LOVES HER. HE LAUGHS AT HER, SAYS MEAN THINGS TO HER ABOUT HOW STUPID SHE IS, AND SHE LEAVES CRYING.
POD1000000019_S0000117	FAST FORWARD TO SIX MONTHS LATER. IT'S EARLY IN THE FALL OF 1967. GENIE'S IN LAS VEGAS FOR A WEEK AS JOHNNY PAYCHECK'S OPENER. PAYCHECK IS ON HIS WAY UP AFTER HAVING HIS FIRST TOP 10 HIT THE YEAR BEFORE WITH THE LOVIN' MACHINE.
POD1000000019_S0000119	PHIL BLACKMAN IS ALSO IN LAS VEGAS, BUT GENIE MANAGES TO RESIST HIS ADVANCES.
POD1000000019_S0000120	FAST FORWARD AGAIN TO JANUARY OF 1968. JEANNIE GETS BLACKMAN TO RELEASE HER FROM HER CONTRACT SO SHE CAN GO RECORD FOR LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS.
POD1000000019_S0000121	THIS IS THE RECORD LABEL STARTED BY JOHNNY PAYCHECK AND HIS PRODUCER, AUBREY MAYHEW, WHO HAD HEARD JEANNIE SING IN VEGAS AND DECIDED HE'D LIKE TO RECORD HER.
POD1000000019_S0000122	AUBREY DOES RECORD HER, A SINGLE IS RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLIN, BUT LIKE THE BLACK ROSE SINGLE WITH PHIL BLACKMAN, IT'S ONLY TECHNICALLY RELEASED, NOT REALLY PROMOTED, BECAUSE THEY, QUOTE, WOUND UP IN CONTRACT DIFFICULTIES.
POD1000000019_S0000123	I WILL COME BACK TO THIS.
POD1000000019_S0000125	MEANWHILE, JERRY CHESTNUT HAS DECIDED TO GET OUT OF THE VACUUM CLEANER BUSINESS AND ALL THE WAY INTO THE MUSIC BUSINESS, OPENING UP A MUSIC ROW OFFICE FOR HIS PUBLISHING COMPANY.
POD1000000019_S0000126	HE HIRES JEANNIE AS A SECRETARY, WHICH IS WHERE SHE'S WORKING WHEN A SONGWRITER FRIEND ASKED HER TO SING ON THE DEMO OF HIS NEW SONG HE WANTS SHELBY SINGLETON AT PLANTATION RECORDS TO HEAR.
POD1000000019_S0000127	I COULDN'T FIND A RECORDING OF GENIE SINGING IT, BUT I FOUND THE SONGWRITER SINGING IT HIMSELF, SO YOU CAN TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT GENIE WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE ON THE DEMO.
POD1000000019_S0000128	CLARK BENTLEY'S OLD TOWN DRUNK COMES OUT ON PLANTATION RECORDS IN 1968.
POD1000000019_S0000130	WHEN SHELBY HEARS THE DEMO, HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THE VOICE OF THE SINGER THAN THE SONG. IF YOU LISTENED TO LAST WEEK'S EPISODE, THIS IS THE PART WHERE HE WANTS TO MEET THAT SINGER TO SEE IF SHE'S GOT THE IMAGE HE'S LOOKING FOR TO SING HARPER VALLEY PTA.
POD1000000019_S0000132	HERE ON JEANNIE'S SIDE, SHE WANTS TO LISTEN TO HARPER VALLEY PTA BEFORE SHE AGREES TO ANYTHING. HER MANAGER PAUL PERRY THINKS SHE'S CRAZY FOR NOT GETTING ON BOARD SIGHT UNSEEN, BUT HE BRINGS HER A TAPE. SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE SONG.
POD1000000019_S0000133	JUST DOESN'T LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SAYS IT SOUNDS LIKE A SOFT REDO OF ODE TO BILLY JOE. NOW PAUL PERRY AND ALL HER FRIENDS THINK SHE'S CRAZY. SHE AGREES TO MEET WITH SHELBY AND THERE'S SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T LIKE ABOUT HIM TOO.
POD1000000019_S0000134	SHELBY TELLS HER THEY CAN MAKE A POP HIT TOGETHER, BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO CHANGE HER NAME BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY GENIES IN NASHVILLE. SAME OLD STORY. HE WANTS TO CALL HER RHONDA RENEE.
POD1000000019_S0000135	SHE'S THINKING ABOUT THAT WHEN PERRY SAYS IF GENIE DOESN'T TAKE THIS DEAL, THEN HE CAN'T REPRESENT HER ANYMORE. IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. SHE SIGNS THE PAPERS, GOES HOME, AND CRIES ABOUT IT.
POD1000000019_S0000136	HER HUSBAND MICKEY COMES HOME TO FIND HER UPSET, HEARS THE STORY ABOUT THEM WANTING TO CHANGE HER NAME, CALLS PAUL PERRY, AND YELLS AT HIM TO TEAR UP THE CONTRACT. JEANNIE'S NOT DOING IT.
POD1000000019_S0000137	THE NEXT DAY, ALL THE BUSINESS PEOPLE CONVINCE HER THEY'LL LET HER KEEP HER OWN NAME IF SHE JUST COMES IN ON FRIDAY, AFTER WORK, TO RECORD THIS DAMN SONG. THE ENTIRE DAY FRIDAY, JEANNIE'S PISSED OFF AT THE WORLD.
POD1000000019_S0000138	SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S BEING BACKED INTO A CORNER AND TALKED INTO DOING SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO. ON TOP OF THAT, SHE'S SURE EVERYONE'S LYING TO HER ABOUT GETTING TO USE HER REAL NAME.
POD1000000019_S0000139	STILL, SHE GOES TO THE STUDIO, CHANNELS HER ANGER INTO THE SONG, AND NAILS IT ON THE SECOND TAKE.
POD1000000019_S0000141	SHELBY TELLS JEANNIE THEY'LL USE HER MIDDLE INITIAL TO MAKE HER STAND OUT MORE FROM THE OTHER JEANNIES AND ADD AN I TO HER FIRST NAME SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT PRONOUNCED JEAN
POD1000000019_S0000142	FINDING OUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RONDA RENE, PLUS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SEEMS CERTAIN SHE JUST CUT A MASSIVE HIT SONG, IMPROVES JEANNIE'S MOOD.
POD1000000019_S0000143	SHE CALLS HER MOTHER AT 1 IN THE MORNING TO TELL HER SHE JUST RECORDED A SONG THAT'S GONNA BE THE NUMBER ONE SONG IN THE COUNTRY.
POD1000000019_S0000144	THE MASTERS ARE MIXED AND SENT TO THE PRESSING PLANT ON SATURDAY MORNING. GENIE SPENDS MONDAY HANDWRITING HUNDREDS OF PERSONALIZED NOTES TO GO WITH PROMO COPIES TO DJS ALL OVER AMERICA.
POD1000000019_S0000145	ANY TIME SHE COMES TO HER OWN NAME OR THE NAME OF A SONG, SHE SWITCHES FROM BLACK INK TO RED SO IT STANDS OUT ON THE PAGE. A STATION IN OHIO PLAYS THE SINGLE 26 TIMES IN ONE DAY. OTHER STATIONS BAN IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HER UPPITY TONE.
POD1000000019_S0000146	LOVE IT OR HATE IT, EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT IT. ACCORDING TO JEANNIE, SHE AND MICKEY TAKE A COPY OVER TO RALPH EMERY AT WSM.
POD1000000019_S0000147	THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY CONFLICT WITH JERRY KENNEDY'S STORY ABOUT SHELBY TAKING OVER AN ACETATE THE NIGHT OF THE SESSION. GENIE WOULD WANT RALPH TO HAVE A REAL COPY OF THE RECORD. BUT THEN GENIE SAYS RALPH TELLS MICKEY, Y'ALL BE REALLY CAREFUL.
POD1000000019_S0000148	SO MANY FAMILIES BREAK UP AS SOON AS THE SINGER HITS THE BIG TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000149	THE NEXT FRIDAY, THEY'RE IN PHILADELPHIA FOR JEANNIE TO SING HER SONG ON TV, SATURDAY, NEW YORK CITY. JEANNIE'S WITH MICKEY, PAUL PERRY, AND HIS WIFE, SHELBY, AND A DOZEN OTHER BUSINESS PEOPLE FROM NASHVILLE.
POD1000000019_S0000150	A REAL ENTOURAGE. THEY STAY IN NICE HOTELS, DRINK CHAMPAGNE, ORDER ROOM SERVICE, AND LEAVE HUGE TIPS AT DINNERS. GENIE DOESN'T REALIZE HOW ALL THIS WORKS UNTIL LATER.
POD1000000019_S0000151	WHEN SHE FINDS OUT SHE'S THE ONE PAYING FOR ALL OF THAT. GENIE AND MICKEY DON'T NEED HELP SPENDING THE MONEY. THEY'RE THROWING DOWN MAJOR CASH ON CLOTHING, JEWELRY, HAIRSTYLES, CARS, ALL THE USUAL ROCK STAR STUFF.
POD1000000019_S0000152	A WEEK AFTER NEW YORK, THEY'RE IN FLORIDA DOING A SHOW WITH WAYLON JENNINGS. OUT OF NOWHERE, WAYLON TELLS JEANNIE THAT SHE WON'T STAY MARRIED TO MICKEY FOR LONG BECAUSE HE JUST DON'T FIT THE SCENE.
POD1000000019_S0000153	IF YOU EVER NEED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR LIFE, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO STAND BY A COUNTRY MUSICIAN FOR A FEW MINUTES. THEY'RE ALL PSYCHIC AND CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO GIVE YOU ADVICE.
POD1000000019_S0000155	ANYWAY, PRETTY SOON, JEANNIE STARTS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH HER MANAGER, PAUL PERRY. ONE NIGHT, THEY'RE SITTING AROUND HOLDING HANDS, AND PERRY'S TALKING ABOUT HOW CAREFUL JEANNIE HAS TO BE NOW THAT SHE'S ON TOP.
POD1000000019_S0000156	HE SURE HOPES SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN HER PAST THAT COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT HER. YOU KNOW, LIKE NUDIE PICTURES TAKEN BY PHIL BLACKMAN?
POD1000000019_S0000158	BACK IN NASHVILLE, FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING, GENIE HEADS OVER TO BLACK ROSE RECORDS. THERE'S BLACKMAN IN HIS OFFICE, PACKING UP A STACK OF BRAND NEW GENIE C. REILLY RECORDS.
POD1000000019_S0000159	MADE FROM HER OLD SESSIONS WITH HIM. NOW THAT JEANIE'S GOT THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE NATION, THESE RECORDS WILL SELL.
POD1000000019_S0000160	THEY ARGUE. SHE DEMANDS THE NAKED PICTURES. HE PLAYS STUPID AT FIRST, BUT THEN SAYS, IT'LL TAKE HIM A COUPLE DAYS TO GET THEM. COME BACK WEDNESDAY. SKIP TO WEDNESDAY.
POD1000000019_S0000161	BLACKMAN'S GOT A MANILA ENVELOPE LIKE YOU SEE IN EVERY MOVIE ABOUT A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND HE WANTS TO GIVE IT TO JEANNIE BUT FIRST SHE'S GOT TO SIGN A NEW PIECE OF PAPER SAYING SHE WON'T SUE HIM FOR RELEASING HER OLD RECORDINGS
POD1000000019_S0000162	SEE, HE'S LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT, AND SHE'LL EVEN GET PAID ROYALTIES AND EVERYTHING. IT'S JUST THAT HE LOST THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACT. SO SIGN HERE AND HERE, AND YOU CAN HAVE THOSE PICTURES.
POD1000000019_S0000163	OF COURSE SHE SIGNS THE THING. THEN, WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING IN THE MANILA ENVELOPE, SHE ASKS HIM TO BURN IT, WHICH HE DOES IN FRONT OF HER. BY THE TIME SHE GETS HOME,
POD1000000019_S0000164	HALF AN HOUR LATER, THE NEWS IS REPORTING THAT BLACK ROSE RECORDS HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST HARPER VALLEY PTA'S SINGER AND RECORD LABEL FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT.
POD1000000019_S0000165	OKAY, HERE'S THE THING. PHIL BLACKMAN AND AUBREY MAYHEW ARE AT LEAST PARTIALLY THE SAME PERSON.
POD1000000019_S0000166	YOU DO REMEMBER AUBREY, RIGHT? JOHNNY PAYCHECK'S PRODUCER THAT HEARD JEANNIE SING IN VEGAS WANTED TO RECORD HER AND THAT'S WHY SHE GOT BLACKMAN TO LET HER OUT OF HER CONTRACT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
POD1000000019_S0000167	YEAH, THAT'S ALL BULLSHIT.
POD1000000019_S0000168	PHIL BLACKMAN AND BLACK ROSE RECORDS ARE NOT FAKE NAMES FOR SOMEONE AND SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE GENIE GOT INVOLVED WITH AUBREY MAYHEW AND LITTLE DARLIN.
POD1000000019_S0000169	JEANNIE TELLS THE SAME STORY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS AS A RED HERRING. BLACK ROSE RECORDS IS LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS.
POD1000000019_S0000170	WHICH IS ALSO THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY JEANNIE WOULD BE IN LAS VEGAS OPENING UP FOR JOHNNY PAYCHECK WHEN ALL SHE'S SUPPOSEDLY DONE IS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE FOR BLACK ROSE RECORDS.
POD1000000019_S0000171	IF YOU WERE TO REWIND THIS EPISODE AND LISTEN TO THE PART ABOUT HOW PHIL BLACKMAN CAME INTO GENIE C. REILLY'S LIFE, YOU'D BE LISTENING TO THE STORY OF HOW AUBREY MAYHEW CAME INTO HER LIFE.
POD1000000019_S0000172	YOU'D BE LISTENING TO THE STORY OF HOW GENIE C. REILLY CAME TO BE SIGNED TO LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS.
POD1000000019_S0000173	I KNOW THIS BECAUSE IT'S DESCRIBED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IN COURT DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE LAWSUIT JEANNIE JUST TOLD US ABOUT.
POD1000000019_S0000174	QUOTE, AS TO LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS, THE AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL BILL ASSERTS THAT PRIOR TO THE TIME COMPLAINANT WAS INCORPORATED, ITS PRESIDENT, AUBREY MAYHEW, DID BUSINESS IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK,
POD1000000019_S0000175	AN INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE PROPRIETARY NAME OF LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS. THAT HIS FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF DEFENDANT RILEY WAS A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM ON THE DATE OF DECEMBER 8, 1966 BY PAUL PERRY.
POD1000000019_S0000176	AND CLOSING THE TAPE AND PHOTO MENTIONED.
POD1000000019_S0000177	THERE WAS NO BARELY RELEASED BLACK ROSE SINGLE BEFORE THE BARELY RELEASED LITTLE DARLIN' SINGLE. THERE WAS ONE BARELY RELEASED SINGLE.
POD1000000019_S0000178	THE CONTRACT DIFFICULTIES JEANNIE MENTIONS TO EXPLAIN WHY HER LITTLE DARLIN' SINGLE SUFFERED THE SAME FATE AS HER BLACK ROSE SINGLE? THAT'S THIS LAWSUIT. THE COURT DOCUMENT SHEDS MORE LIGHT ON THIS.
POD1000000019_S0000179	IN RESPONSE TO MAYHEW'S LAWSUIT, GENIE TELLS THE COURT THAT MAYHEW WAS NEVER CONVINCED SHE HAD ENOUGH TALENT TO SUCCEED AS A RECORDING ARTIST.
POD1000000019_S0000180	AND DID NOT UNDERTAKE TO PRODUCE ANY RECORDS OF HER VOICE FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION.
POD1000000019_S0000181	IN OTHER WORDS, AUBREY MAYHEW DIDN'T THINK JEANNIE WAS THAT GOOD OF A SINGER. HE WAS USING HER AS LITTLE MORE THAN A SESSION VOCALIST FOR DEMO TAPES HE NEEDED DONE ANYWAY, WHILE LETTING HER BELIEVE SHE WAS A REAL RECORDING ARTIST.
POD1000000019_S0000182	GENIE SEEMS TO THINK THAT ONE SINGLE WAS JUST HIM GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS TO STRING HER ALONG, AND SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.
POD1000000019_S0000183	SPEAKING VERY STRICTLY, HARPER VALLEY PTA IS NOT HER DEBUT SINGLE, AS I SAID IT WAS IN THE INTRO OF THIS EPISODE. BUT HER FIRST SINGLE MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR AN AUDIENCE LARGER THAN HER IMMEDIATE CIRCLE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
POD1000000019_S0000184	SOMETHING PHYSICAL FOR GENIE TO PLAY PRETEND WITH TO KEEP THE WHOLE CHARADE GOING. IT WAS CALLED YOU WRITE THE MUSIC, CREDITED TO GENE REILLY, QUOTE UNQUOTE, RELEASED ON LITTLE DARLIN RECORDS IN 1967.
POD1000000019_S0000186	AUBREY'S FIRST MISTAKE WAS SIGNING JEANNIE TO A REAL RECORDING CONTRACT, WHICH STIPULATED THAT SHE BE RECORDED FOUR TIMES A YEAR. A STIPULATION NOT MET BY USING HER FOR DEMO SESSIONS.
POD1000000019_S0000187	HIS SECOND MISTAKE WAS RELEASING HER FROM HER CONTRACT ON APRIL 3RD OF 1968, FOUR MONTHS BEFORE SHE RECORDED HARPER VALLEY PTA.
POD1000000019_S0000188	NOW HERE ARE THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK I CAN OR SHOULD EVEN TRY TO ANSWER. DID AUBREY MAYHEW AND GENIE C. REILLY HAVE AN AFFAIR?
POD1000000019_S0000189	AND DID AUBREY MAYHEW TAKE NAKED PHOTOGRAPHS OF GENIE C. REILLY WITHOUT HER CONSENT AND THEN BLACKMAIL HER?
POD1000000019_S0000190	TECHNICALLY, GENIE HAS NEVER ALLEGED EITHER OF THESE THINGS AGAINST AUBREY MAYHEW.
POD1000000019_S0000191	THAT WAS PHIL BLACKMAN. I'M GONNA PLAY IT SAFE AND POINT OUT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE PHIL BLACKMAN IS MEANT AS AN AMALGAMATION OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON.
POD1000000019_S0000192	I'M NOT IN ANY WAY A PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATOR. ALL I DID WAS READ A BUNCH OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND MATCH IT TO WHAT JEANNIE WROTE IN HER BOOK.
POD1000000019_S0000193	AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, I'M THE FIRST READER OF GENIE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHO CARED ENOUGH TO TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS. OR AT LEAST I'M THE FIRST ONE TO TALK ABOUT IT.
POD1000000019_S0000194	SEARCHING JEANNIE AND AUBREY'S NAMES TOGETHER ONLY BRINGS UP INFORMATION ABOUT THEM HAVING WORKED TOGETHER AND INFORMATION ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT. BUT LISTEN, EVEN IF PHIL BLACKMAN IS 100% AUBREY MAYHEW,
POD1000000019_S0000195	AND EVEN IF WE CHOOSE TO 100% BELIEVE EVERYTHING JEANNIE SAYS ABOUT HIM, THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN AUBREY MAYHEW TOOK THOSE PICTURES. JEANNIE SAYS SHE HAD HIM BURN THE ENVELOPE WITHOUT LOOKING INSIDE.
POD1000000019_S0000196	SHE EVEN BRINGS UP THE POSSIBILITY HERSELF THAT THE ENVELOPE COULD HAVE BEEN EMPTY.
POD1000000019_S0000197	IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY PORNOGRAPHIC PHOTOGRAPHS WERE MENTIONED IN THE COURTROOM AT ALL.
POD1000000019_S0000198	THE CASE WAS RULED IN FAVOR OF SHELBY SINGLETON AND JEANNIE C. RILEY.
POD1000000019_S0000199	BACK IN THE BUSINESS OF PROMOTING THEIR HIT SINGLE, GENIE GETS SENT TO CHARM SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO WALK, TALK, AND ACT ON STAGE.
POD1000000019_S0000200	THEN SHE'S SENT ON TOUR. CONCERTS, TALK SHOWS, RADIO SHOWS, LIVE TV APPEARANCES. HER HOMETOWN NAMES A DAY IN APRIL, GENIE C. RILEY DAY, AND THERE'S A BIG CEREMONY FOR THAT.
POD1000000019_S0000201	SHE GETS TO PICK WILD MOUNTAIN BERRIES WITH GLEN CAMPBELL ON TV.
POD1000000019_S0000203	SHE GETS TO LIVE HER DREAM OF PERFORMING ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY.
POD1000000019_S0000205	BUT THEN SHE GETS HER FIRST ROYALTY CHECK AND FINDS OUT HOW MUCH OF THE MONEY BEING SPENT IS HERS. BASICALLY ALL OF IT. SHE'S ALWAYS EXPECTED TO HANG OUT AND BE NICE TO INDUSTRY PEOPLE.
POD1000000019_S0000206	ONE NIGHT, THERE'S A SCENE WITH MICKEY, WHEN A RANDOM SUIT AT A PARTY IS TOO PERSISTENT IN TRYING TO GET GENIE TO DANCE WITH HIM. MICKEY GRABS THE GUY'S WRIST AND TELLS HIM TO BACK OFF.
POD1000000019_S0000207	LATER, SHELBY TELLS JEANNIE THAT MICKEY NEEDS TO STAY HOME IF HE CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF, AND MICKEY IS BANISHED FROM THE ROAD.
POD1000000019_S0000208	IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THE IDEA THAT JEANNIE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET FOR THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER CAREER, I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS ACCURATE.
POD1000000019_S0000210	NOW, ASIDE FROM THE SONG ITSELF, THE BIGGEST IMPACT GENIE C. RILEY HAD ON COUNTRY MUSIC WITH HARPER VALLEY PTA WAS IN FASHION.
POD1000000019_S0000212	IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS TODAY, BUT IN THE LATE 60S, THAT LINE IN THE SONG ABOUT THE SINGLE MOTHER WEARING MINISKIRTS? THAT IN ITSELF WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A LOT OF COUNTRY MUSIC FANS GASP AND TURN OFF THE RADIO.
POD1000000019_S0000213	AND WHILE THE SONG IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE DAUGHTER CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T DRESS THAT WAY, EVERY TIME YOU SEE GENIE SEE RILEY, SHE LOOKS LIKE MRS. JOHNSON.
POD1000000019_S0000215	HER STYLE, OR MORE ACCURATELY, THE STYLE SHE WAS MADE TO WEAR, WOULD BEST BE DESCRIBED AS MAUD, LIKE NANCY SINATRA IN HER BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING PHASE.
POD1000000019_S0000216	WAY BEFORE ANY OTHER WOMEN IN COUNTRY MUSIC WERE DRESSING THAT WAY. WE'RE TALKING MINISKIRTS, GO GO BOOTS, AND IN OCTOBER OF 1968, THE FIRST YEAR THE CMA AWARDS WERE TELEVISED,
POD1000000019_S0000217	A RIDICULOUS DRESS.
POD1000000019_S0000219	THE RUFFLES START HALFWAY UP HER RIBCAGE AND POOF WAY OUT LIKE THEY WOULD TO MAKE A BELL SHAPE DOWN TO THE GROUND, BUT THEN IT ALL JUST STOPS HALFWAY DOWN HER THIGHS, SHOWING OFF LEGS AND HIGH HEEL COWGIRL BOOTS.
POD1000000019_S0000221	AFTER SEEING THE DRESS BUT BEFORE THE SHOW, SHE CALLED SHELBY SINGLETON TO YELL AT HIM. IN THE MIDDLE OF HER TIRADE, AFTER SHE TELLS HIM SHE'S NOT MISS HARPER VALLEY PTA,
POD1000000019_S0000222	SHE'S AN ARTIST. SHELBY CUTS HER OFF TO SAY, YOU'RE NOT AN ARTIST, BABY. YOU'RE A COMMODITY. A MINI SKIRTED, SILVER BOOTED COMMODITY. NOW BE THERE EARLY. WE'VE GOT A SHOW TO REHEARSE.
POD1000000019_S0000223	THAT'S ONE EXCHANGE THAT I DON'T DOUBT FOR A SECOND HAPPENED JUST LIKE THAT.
POD1000000019_S0000225	THE REST OF JEANNIE'S BOOK IS ABOUT HER STRUGGLES WITH INFIDELITY AND CONVERSION TO RELIGION. MORE PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE MYSTICAL PSYCHIC POWERS.
POD1000000019_S0000226	LIKE AFTER A DIVORCE FROM MICKEY, A RANDOM SALES CLERK IN A DEPARTMENT STORE SOMEWHERE STOPS JEANNIE TO SAY, YOUR EX HUSBAND STILL LOVES YOU. GOD WANTS YOU TO GO BACK TO HIM. BULLSHIT LIKE THAT.
POD1000000019_S0000227	SHE TELLS THE STORY OF THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIES POT, HAVING AN INTENSELY SPIRITUAL VISION THAT SENDS HER INTO A FUGUE STATE FOR CLOSE TO 24 HOURS AND SOUNDS MORE LIKE AN AYAHUASCA TRIP THAN ANY WEED I'VE EVER SMOKED.
POD1000000019_S0000228	FROM THE NIGHTMARE SHE DESCRIBES, YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO BE THE ONLY TIME SHE EVER TOKED UP. BUT THIS VIDEO CLIP OF RALPH EMERY INTERVIEWING HER SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE.
POD1000000019_S0000230	SO I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY FOR THE REST OF THIS EPISODE AND TALK MORE ABOUT THE MUSIC GENIE MADE AFTER HER HIT. BECAUSE THAT LAST SENTENCE IS PRETTY TYPICAL OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT GENIE C. REILLY'S CAREER.
POD1000000019_S0000231	REFERENCE TO HER HIT AS IF SHE HAD ONLY ONE. A ONE HIT WONDER, IF YOU WILL.
POD1000000019_S0000233	WHILE IT'S TRUE SHE NEVER TOOK ANOTHER SONG TO NUMBER ONE ON BOTH POP AND COUNTRY CHARTS, NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER DONE THAT.
POD1000000019_S0000234	THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN TO DO THAT IN THE 1900S IS DOLLY PARTON WITH 9 TO 5 IN 1981, MAKING JEANNIE THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER DO IT. IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE FARCE WITH LITTLE DARLIN' RECORDS,
POD1000000019_S0000235	WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT, SHE'S THE ONLY WOMAN TO DO IT WITH HER DEBUT SINGLE. IT'S SO UNFAIR TO JUDGE THE REST OF HER OUTPUT AGAINST THAT. THAT'S LIKE MOCKING A ROOKIE BASKETBALL PLAYER FOR ONLY BREAKING A WORLD RECORD ONE TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000236	JEANNIE'S FOLLOW UP SINGLE TO HARPER VALLEY PTA WAS CALLED, THE GIRL MOST LIKELY.
POD1000000019_S0000237	STICKING WITH THE FORMULA, IT'S ANOTHER SONG ABOUT PREJUDICE IN A SMALL TOWN. THIS TIME IT'S THE GIRL WHO EVERYONE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO GET IN THAT SPECIAL KIND OF TROUBLE ONLY A TEENAGE GIRL CAN GET IN,
POD1000000019_S0000238	ONLY TURNS OUT IT'S THE MISS GOODY TWO SHOES OF THE TOWN WHO GETS KNOCKED UP BY THE TOWN DOCTOR'S SON INSTEAD.
POD1000000019_S0000240	IT WENT TO NUMBER 6 ON THE COUNTRY CHART AND NUMBER 55 ON THE BILLBOARD HOT 100. I WOULD CALL THAT A HIT SONG.
POD1000000019_S0000242	AFTER THAT, AUBREY MAYHEW PUT OUT AN ALBUM CONSISTING OF EVERYTHING HE HAD SUNG BY JEANNIE DURING HER TIME WITH LITTLE DARLIN'.
POD1000000019_S0000244	THE ALBUM IS CALLED SOCK SOUL. I'M GUESSING IN REFERENCE TO THE LINE IN HARPER VALLEY PTA ABOUT HOW MRS. JOHNSON SOCKED IT TO HIM.
POD1000000019_S0000245	BUT THIS STUFF WAS ALL RECORDED BEFORE ANYONE THOUGHT OF GENIE C. REILLY AS THE LOUDEST VOICE CALLING BS ON AMERICAN SOCIETY, SO NONE OF THE SONGS BIT THAT ALBUM TITLE OR HER IMAGE.
POD1000000019_S0000246	THE MATERIAL IS GOOD, IT'S JUST IN THE SAME VEIN BEING MINED BY EVERY OTHER FEMALE VOICE IN COUNTRY MUSIC.
POD1000000019_S0000248	THE PRICE I PAY TO STAY BARELY CRACKED THE COUNTRY TOP 40. FROM THERE, HER SINGLES WERE HIT OR MISS, IF YOU JUDGE THEM BY COMMERCIAL RESULTS.
POD1000000019_S0000249	BUT EVEN WHEN SHE RELEASED A LEGITIMATE HIT, NOBODY SAW IT THAT WAY BECAUSE IT WASN'T ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA.
POD1000000019_S0000251	HER FIRST PROPER SINGLE RELEASED AFTER THAT LITTLE DARLIN COMPILATION OF BASICALLY DEMO RECORDINGS WAS THERE NEVER WAS A TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000252	HERE'S HER DOING IT ON THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW
POD1000000019_S0000254	THAT SONG WAS A TOP 5 COUNTRY HIT THAT ALSO CRACKED THE POP HOT 100. NOW LISTEN TO HOW GREAT THIS OTHER SINGLE IS FROM THE SAME ALBUM AS THAT SONG. THE BACKSIDE OF DALLAS WASN'T A HIT, BUT IT'S A DAMN GOOD SONG.
POD1000000019_S0000256	UP UNTIL THE MID 70S THE QUALITY OF HER MUSIC REMAINED PRETTY CONSISTENT HERE'S HER NEXT TOP 10 COUNTRY GIRL
POD1000000019_S0000258	SHE WAS STARTING TO BRANCH AWAY FROM THE HARPER VALLEY PTA PROTOTYPE OF GETTING ON A MICROPHONE AND POINTING FINGERS AT
POD1000000019_S0000259	ALSO, LETTING JEANNIE MULTITRACK HER OWN HARMONY VOCALS WAS A GREAT WAY TO SHUT UP THE CRITICS WHO LIKED TO SAY SHE HAD NO RANGE AS A SINGER.
POD1000000019_S0000260	AND OF COURSE, MOST OF THESE CRITICS WERE POP WRITERS WHO WERE ONLY AWARE OF GENIE C. REILLY BECAUSE OF THE POP SUCCESS OF HARBOR VALLEY PTA, AND WHOSE ONLY OTHER FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR COUNTRY MUSIC IN THE 60S AND 70S WAS PROBABLY JOHNNY CASH.
POD1000000019_S0000261	LIKE THE LA TIMES POP CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN, WHO REVIEWED A GENIE C. REILLY CONCERT IN 1971 UNDER THE HEADLINE, LITTLE TALENT.
POD1000000019_S0000262	QUOTE, GENIE C. REILLY HAS ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, VERY LITTLE OF THE TALENT.
POD1000000019_S0000263	FIRST OF ALL, HER VOICE ISN'T ANY GOOD. SECOND, NEITHER IS HER MATERIAL. THAT'S TWO STRIKES AGAINST HER, AND AS SOON AS THE PUBLIC FORGETS HARPER VALLEY PTA, THAT'S THREE STRIKES AND SHE'S OUT.
POD1000000019_S0000264	NOW MAYBE THAT GUY WAS HAVING A BAD DAY OR SOMETHING, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT. HE'S WRONG ON EVERY SINGLE POINT. FROM EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN, GENIE C. REILLY WAS EVEN BETTER LIVE THAN ON RECORDING.
POD1000000019_S0000266	CHECK OUT THIS PERFORMANCE OF A SONG YOU HEARD JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO, BACKSIDE OF DALLAS.
POD1000000019_S0000268	SHE ALWAYS HAD A CRACK BAND BEHIND HER, THE HARPER VALLEY EXPRESS. THEY USUALLY MADE THE TEMPO OF EVERYTHING FASTER TO REALLY PUT SOME GAS IN THE TANK, AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY JEANNIE'S CHARISMA AS A PERFORMER.
POD1000000019_S0000270	THE SONG SHE'S SINGING IS ABOUT A WOMAN BECOMING A PROSTITUTE AND HER EXPRESSIONS ALTERNATE BETWEEN SASSY AND SERIOUS IN A WAY THAT KEEPS SHIFTING THE MEANING OF THE LYRICS.
POD1000000019_S0000272	THOSE CHARM SCHOOL CLASSES PAID OFF. SHE KNEW HOW TO WORK A CROWD, STRIKING POSES AND FLASHING 20 DIFFERENT KINDS OF SMILE IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES.
POD1000000019_S0000273	BUT THAT LA TIMES REVIEW OF HER CONCERT IS THE SORT OF DISMISSIVE ATTITUDE THE POP INTELLIGENTSIA HAD TOWARDS SOUTHERN CULTURE.
POD1000000019_S0000274	NOT ONLY WAS JEANNIE NOT A ONE HIT WONDER, SHE MADE GOOD ALBUMS WITH VERY LITTLE FILLER. CHECK OUT THIS ALBUM TRACK FROM 1972, NEVER EVEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE, CALLED WITHOUT YOU.
POD1000000019_S0000276	HER VOICE IS ON, THE MELODY IS THERE, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT FROM A COUNTRY LOVE SONG? THIS IS THE KIND OF TRACK YOU HOPE IS WAITING TO SURPRISE YOU WHEN YOU BUY SOMEONE'S ALBUM BASED ON ONE OR TWO OF THE SINGLES.
POD1000000019_S0000277	WITHOUT YOU IS BRUMGINI'S SECOND ALBUM ON MGM, AFTER LEAVING PLANTATION RECORDS IN 1972 IN WHAT SHELBY SINGLETON CALLED A BREACH OF CONTRACT.
POD1000000019_S0000278	JEANNIE'S LOCK IN THE COURTROOM HELD, WINNING THIS CASE AS WELL. THOUGH SHE MAINTAINED FOR THE REST OF HER CAREER THAT SHE WAS NEVER PAID WHAT SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS OWED FOR HARPER VALLEY PTA'S EARNINGS.
POD1000000019_S0000280	HER FULL COMMITMENT TO CHRISTIANITY SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE SOMETIME IN THE 70S
POD1000000019_S0000281	AND SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED AT LEAST SOME REGRET FOR HER PREVIOUS PERSONA AS COUNTRY MUSIC'S MOST BLATANT SEX SYMBOL TO DATE. THE CLOTHING CHANGED, THE MUSIC TOOK A TURN TO GOSPEL, AND
POD1000000019_S0000282	THIS IS PURELY SPECULATION ON MY PART, BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE MONEY COULD HAVE REALLY BECOME A PROBLEM FOR HER IN THE EARLY 1980S.
POD1000000019_S0000283	THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF HERS WAS PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1981, SHORTLY BEFORE THE RELEASE OF A GOSPEL ALBUM WITH THE SAME TITLE AS THE BOOK.
POD1000000019_S0000284	GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHEN A MUSICAL ARTIST QUOTE UNQUOTE PASSED THEIR PRIME, PUTS OUT AN ALBUM RIGHT AFTER THEY PUT OUT A BOOK,
POD1000000019_S0000285	IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT BOOK IS MEANT TO GENERATE NEW INTEREST IN THAT ARTIST'S MUSIC IN ADVANCE OF THE NEW ALBUM.
POD1000000019_S0000287	IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S OFTEN A PROMOTIONAL STRATEGY. IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE, THEN THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THIS BOOK WAS PRINTED BY A SMALL PUBLISHER OF CHRISTIAN BOOKS.
POD1000000019_S0000289	IT MAY NOT BE SAFE TO ASSUME THAT NO MAJOR PUBLISHERS WERE INTERESTED, AND THAT'S WHY GENIE WENT WITH THE SMALL CHRISTIAN PUBLISHER.
POD1000000019_S0000290	HOWEVER, IT DOES SEEM VERY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THIS SMALL CHRISTIAN PUBLISHING HOUSE WOULD MOSTLY, IF NOT EXCLUSIVELY, HAVE A PROMOTIONAL NETWORK MEANT TO GET THEIR PRODUCT IN FRONT OF CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS.
POD1000000019_S0000291	AKA THE EXACT OPPOSITE AUDIENCE OF THE ONLY REASON ANYONE KNOWS GENIE C. REILLY'S NAME, HARPER VALLEY PTA. A SONG HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HYPOCRISY IN SOCIAL GROUPS WITH HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES.
POD1000000019_S0000293	EVEN THE MUSIC FANS WHO DID FIND THE BOOK WOULDN'T BE LIKELY TO RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND BECAUSE OF HOW POORLY IT IS WRITTEN AND HOW MOST OF IT IS IRRELEVANT TO HER CAREER IN MUSIC.
POD1000000019_S0000295	PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE BOOK BECAUSE THEY HAPPENED TO SEE IT ON ONE OF THEIR REGULAR TRIPS TO THE CHRISTIAN BOOKSTORE WOULD NO DOUBT BE SCANDALIZED BY JEANNIE'S RAMPANT INFIDELITY AND THE POT SMOKING.
POD1000000019_S0000297	THE USED COPY THAT I HAVE ONCE BELONGED TO A LIBRARY IN NEW MEXICO. IT STILL HAS THE STAMP CARD IN THE BACK. I CAN SEE HERE THAT ONLY FOUR PEOPLE CHECKED IT OUT IN 1981.
POD1000000019_S0000298	THE YEAR IT WAS PUBLISHED. ONE PERSON IN 1982, NOBODY IN 1983, AND ONE OR TWO READERS A YEAR AT BEST FROM THERE. IT WAS DISCARDED IN 1995.
POD1000000019_S0000299	HAVING BEEN CHECKED OUT A GRAND TOTAL OF 13 TIMES. NOT GOOD, ESPECIALLY IF THAT WAS THE MAIN PLAN TO GET PEOPLE HYPED FOR THAT NEW GOSPEL ALBUM.
POD1000000019_S0000300	WHICH ENTIRELY FAILED TO CHART. IF SHE HAD HOPES OF GETTING OFF THE ROAD, WHERE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MAKING MOST OF HER INCOME, FROM HARPER VALLEY TO THE MOUNTAINTOP AS A BOOK ALBUM COMBO DID NOT DELIVER.
POD1000000019_S0000301	NEXT MOVE, ASK TOM T. HALL TO WRITE ANOTHER HARPER VALLEY PTA. A THING HE'D BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO DO, BUT ALSO HE'S A BIG SOFTIE.
POD1000000019_S0000302	IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE HIM HAVING A HARD TIME SAYING NO WHEN JEANNIE CAME TO HIM ABOUT IT IN 1984. TOM WROTE, HE EVEN MADE ALL THE LYRICS FIT JEANNIE'S NEW CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE.
POD1000000019_S0000304	WE'RE BACK AT HARPER VALLEY HIGH BECAUSE OUR NARRATOR'S GRANDCHILDREN GO TO THE SCHOOL NOW, AND SHE'S BOUGHT A TICKET TO THE RAFFLE AT A SCHOOL DANCE. SHE'S WEARING A DRESS THAT'S WELL BELOW HER KNEES,
POD1000000019_S0000305	BECAUSE JUST ABOUT EVERY CHARACTER FROM THE ORIGINAL SONG IS NOW ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.
POD1000000019_S0000307	BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, SHE SPOTS A MAN GIVING A CIGARETTE TO A SCHOOL KID. AND IT TURNS OUT HE'S SELLING DRUGS IN THE PARKING LOT. THERE'S THE DRUMMER OF THE BAND DOING COCAINE. AND THESE KIDS ARE ALL GETTING DRUNK AND TAKING PILLS AND TAKING OFF THEIR CLOTHES.
POD1000000019_S0000308	SHE THINKS ABOUT GOING HOME FOR HER GUN, BUT INSTEAD DECIDES TO GO HOME, PRAY WITH HER BIBLE, AND YOU GUESSED IT, BRING ALL THIS UP AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THE HARPER VALLEY PTA.
POD1000000019_S0000309	IN SHORT, THE SONG IS TERRIBLE. NOBODY CARED AT ALL.
POD1000000019_S0000310	EVEN WITH TOM JOINING GENIE FOR PROMO APPEARANCES ON ALL THE USUAL TV SHOWS LIKE NASHVILLE NOW.
POD1000000019_S0000313	AS YOU HEARD, THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE WRITING, RECORDING, AND RELEASE OF THIS SONG. WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE RUSH, AND EVEN IF FANS OF THE ORIGINAL SONG HAD GROWN TO DEVELOP MORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES,
POD1000000019_S0000314	THERE SIMPLY WASN'T ENOUGH INTEREST IN THIS RETURN TO GENERATE AIRPLAY OR SALES FIGURES.
POD1000000019_S0000316	SEVEN YEARS LATER, IN 1991, JEANNIE PUT OUT WHAT LOOKS LIKE WILL BE HER FINAL, FORMALLY RELEASED SINGLE. HERE'S TO THE COWBOYS.
POD1000000019_S0000318	THE ENTIRE REVIEW IN BILLBOARD IS ONE SENTENCE. RILEY GIVES A POIGNANT READING OF THIS TRIBUTE TO COWBOYS WHO ARE COMMITTED ENOUGH TO BE DOMESTICATED.
POD1000000019_S0000320	AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ON FOX NEWS IN 2002, SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE, SHE APPARENTLY FORGOT THAT SHE WORKED WITH THE GUY WHO WAS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE ELVIS IS STILL ALIVE RUMORS.
POD1000000019_S0000322	THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO COCAINE AND RHINESTONES. THIS AND EVERY OTHER EPISODE OF THE PODCAST IS WRITTEN AND PRODUCED BY ME, TYLER MAHAN CO.
POD1000000019_S0000323	GO TO COCAINEANDRINESTONES.COM TO SEE THIS EPISODE'S COMPANION BLOG POST. GO THERE AND YOU'LL FIND A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL THE SONGS YOU HEARD EXCERPTS OF, LINKS TO WHERE YOU CAN AND SHOULD BUY THAT MUSIC,
POD1000000019_S0000324	AS WELL AS PICTURES AND VIDEOS RELATED TO SOME THINGS I TALKED ABOUT.
POD1000000019_S0000325	IF YOU ENJOYED THIS EPISODE, OR EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST EXCITED ABOUT SOMEONE FINALLY MAKING A PODCAST DEDICATED TO THE HISTORY OF COUNTRY MUSIC, THEN PLEASE RATE AND REVIEW THE SHOW IN WHATEVER PODCAST DIRECTORIES YOU CAN FIND IT.
POD1000000019_S0000326	I WILL ALSO ASK THAT YOU PLEASE SHARE THIS EPISODE WITH ONE PERSON IN YOUR LIFE. IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD LIKE THIS STORY BUT YOU KNOW THEY HATE PODCASTS OR THEY CAN'T FIGURE THEM OUT OR WHATEVER,
POD1000000019_S0000327	REMEMBER THAT EVERY EPISODE IS CONVERTED INTO A FULL BLOG POST ON COCAINEANDRINESTONES.COM. YOU CAN SEND YOUR FRIEND THERE TO READ THE STORY AND HEY, MAYBE SOMEDAY THEY'LL GIVE THE PODCAST A CHANCE. BUT YOU'RE STILL LISTENING TO ME TALK RIGHT NOW,
POD1000000019_S0000328	SO I HOPE THAT MEANS YOU DID ENJOY THIS ONE. AND I HOPE YOU'RE SUBSCRIBED TO THE SHOW WHEREVER YOU LISTEN TO PODCASTS BECAUSE NEXT WEEK, THE HARPER VALLEY PTA SERIES IS WRAPPING UP WITH TOM T. HALL.
POD1000000019_S0000329	I LOVE TOM T. HALL. BASED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE REQUESTED A TOM T. HALL EPISODE AS SOON AS I WENT PUBLIC WITH THIS SHOW, IT'S SAFE TO SAY A LOT OF YOU DO TOO.
POD1000000019_S0000330	OF COURSE, I HAD THE WHOLE FIRST SEASON WRITTEN BEFORE I RELEASED AN EPISODE, BUT I'VE GOTTA SAY, I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED THAT TOM T WAS SUCH AN INSTANT DEMAND FROM EVERYONE. I THOUGHT I WAS JUST MAKING AN EPISODE ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGWRITERS.
POD1000000019_S0000331	SO I'M EXCITED FOR ALL YOU OTHER TOM T. HALL FANS OUT THERE TO GET YOUR EARS ON THIS ONE.
POD1000000019_S0000332	I DON'T THINK I SHOULD PUT AN AD IN THIS EPISODE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS TELL YOU ABOUT THE OTHER PODCAST I'M DOING.
POD1000000019_S0000333	THE OTHER PODCAST IS CALLED YOUR FAVORITE BAND SUCKS. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS, YOU KNOW? IT'S A COMEDY PODCAST. IT'S MORE LIKE OTHER PODCASTS THAN THIS ONE.
POD1000000019_S0000334	COCAINE AND RHINESTONES IS VERY SCRIPTED, VERY PRODUCED. IT TAKES ME A LONG TIME TO MAKE THESE EPISODES. YOUR FAVORITE BAND SUCKS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE. IT'S JUST MY FRIEND MARK AND I SIT DOWN AND SAY SOME OF THE WORST THINGS YOU WILL EVER HEAR ABOUT BANDS THAT YOU PROBABLY LOVE.
POD1000000019_S0000335	IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ITUNES AND EVERYWHERE BY NOW, OR YOU CAN GO LISTEN TO IT AT YFBSPOD.COM.
POD1000000019_S0000336	OUR FIRST THREE EPISODES ARE OUT NOW. WE DID AN EPISODE ON THE BEATLES, AN EPISODE ON THE ROLLING STONES.
POD1000000019_S0000337	AND AN EPISODE ON CHRISTMAS MUSIC.
POD1000000019_S0000338	UH, YEAH. ENJOY.
POD1000000019_S0000339	ALRIGHT, HERE ARE THE LINER NOTES FOR GENIE C. REILLY.
POD1000000019_S0000340	I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS IN FOR WHEN I BEGAN THIS EPISODE, AND I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE TRUTH IS HERE.
POD1000000019_S0000341	JUST WOW.
POD1000000019_S0000342	I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M REALLY ALLOWED TO SAY RIGHT NOW, BUT I GUESS IF I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS, THEN I PROBABLY ALREADY CROSSED THAT LINE, SO... UH...
POD1000000019_S0000343	I KNOW THERE ARE LIES IN THIS EPISODE, BECAUSE I TOLD YOU WHICH ONES I FOUND OUT ABOUT, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ELSE IS OR ISN'T A LIE.
POD1000000019_S0000344	ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I DID NOT KNOWINGLY PERPETUATE A LIE. WHEN I'M READING A BOOK, I PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS SAVE THE PREFACE AND FOREWORD STUFF UNTIL AFTER I'VE READ THE BOOK.
POD1000000019_S0000345	BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW TIMES READING SOME CLASSIC NOVEL OR SOMETHING WHERE THE PERSON WRITING THE FOREWORD, SOME SCHOLAR OR SOMEONE, ASSUMES EVERYONE MUST HAVE ALREADY READ THIS BOOK BEFORE.
POD1000000019_S0000346	AND THEY DROP MAJOR SPOILERS RIGHT THERE BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN READ THE FIRST PAGE. SO OUT OF HABIT, I JUST NEVER READ THAT STUFF IN THE BEGINNING OF A BOOK. IF THE BOOK'S GOOD, I'LL USUALLY GO BACK AND READ IT, OR IF I'M JUST LIKE, WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST READ, THEN I'LL GO BACK AND READ IT.
POD1000000019_S0000347	AND THAT SECOND SCENARIO WAS VERY MUCH THE CASE WITH GENIE C. REILLY'S BOOK. BY THE SECOND PAGE OF THE BOOK, WHEN SHE WAS PUTTING THOSE WORDS IN SHELBY SINGLETON'S MOUTH AND IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE WAY HE TALKED TO ME,
POD1000000019_S0000348	AND IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE THE WAY THAT SHE WAS HAVING HIM ACT BASED ON OTHER INFORMATION SHE WAS GIVING YOU AT THE SAME TIME, I HAD A FEELING SOMETHING WAS UP.
POD1000000019_S0000349	THEN A LITTLE BIT LATER, SHE'S WRITING ABOUT HAVING JUST MARRIED MICKEY WHILE SHE'S STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. I'LL JUST READ IT TO YOU OUT OF THE BOOK. THIS IS A QUOTE.
POD1000000019_S0000350	MICKEY AND I MOVED INTO A SMALL APARTMENT AND STRUGGLED EACH MONTH TO MAKE IT ON HIS SALARY. WE POSTPONED GOING TO NASHVILLE UNTIL I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND WE COULD SAVE SOME MONEY.
POD1000000019_S0000351	I WAS AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR A CHECKUP WHEN HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT. IN ANOTHER MONTH, WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE, HE SAID. OKAY, AND THE QUOTE.
POD1000000019_S0000352	I DIDN'T SKIP OVER ANYTHING THERE AT ALL. SHE WRITES A SENTENCE ABOUT WAITING TO MOVE TO NASHVILLE UNTIL SHE GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL, THEN THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE IS ABOUT HER FINDING OUT SHE'S PREGNANT.
POD1000000019_S0000353	THERE'S A FOUR YEAR GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO SENTENCES. I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY THAT GAP IS THERE, BUT THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I WAS READING SOME BULLSHIT.
POD1000000019_S0000354	SO AFTER FINISHING THE BOOK, I WENT BACK TO READ THE STUFF AT THE BEGINNING AND I FOUND THAT DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE FACTS BEING ALTERED.
POD1000000019_S0000355	AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS WRITTEN BY JEANNIE'S CO AUTHOR, WHO I ALSO FAILED TO MENTION IS A PREACHER. HERE'S WHAT HE WRITES, QUOTE,
POD1000000019_S0000356	IN ONE INSTANCE WE ALSO CHANGED THE DETAILS SLIGHTLY TO PURPOSEFULLY DISGUISE A SCENE.
POD1000000019_S0000357	ONLY THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED WILL RECOGNIZE WHAT WE HAVE DONE. BUT ALL THE REST IS TRUE, JUST AS IT HAPPENED WHEN GOD PICKED UP THE HARPER VALLEY GIRL AND SET HER ON A MOUNTAINTOP.
POD1000000019_S0000358	OKAY, EVEN THAT DISCLAIMER IS SO ENTIRELY BIZARRE. THE WHOLE THING MAKES ME WONDER IF THIS GUY IS EVEN TALKING ABOUT INVENTING THE CHARACTER OF PHIL BLACKMON.
POD1000000019_S0000359	FIRST OF ALL, THEY CHANGED THE NAMES TO PROTECT PEOPLE JEANNIE LOVES. JEANNIE LOVES THE PERSON WHO BLACKMAILED HER WITH REVENGE PORN. OKAY, NEXT. IN ONE INSTANCE, WE HAVE CHANGED THE DETAILS SLIGHTLY TO DISGUISE A SCENE.
POD1000000019_S0000360	THAT IS NOT AT ALL AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF PHIL BLACKMAN'S EXISTENCE IN THIS BOOK. THERE ARE MANY SCENES THAT HAD A LOT MORE THAN SLIGHT DETAILS CHANGED.
POD1000000019_S0000361	SEVERAL THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FABRICATED. ANYWHERE IN THE BOOK SHE TALKS ABOUT THE FIRST BLACK ROSE SINGLE IS A LIE. TALKING ABOUT MEETING AUBREY MAYHEW IN LAS VEGAS
POD1000000019_S0000362	IS A LIE. TALKING ABOUT GETTING OUT OF A CONTRACT WITH PHIL BLACKMON TO RECORD WITH AUBREY MAYHEW
POD1000000019_S0000363	IS A LIE. IT WOULD TAKE ME 10 MINUTES TO LIST EVERYTHING THAT IS FOR SURE A LIE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO LIST EVERYTHING I SUSPECT IS A LIE IN THIS BOOK.
POD1000000019_S0000364	THEN, STILL WITH THIS DISCLAIMER, THE PART AT THE END WHERE HE WRITES, QUOTE, BUT ALL THE REST IS TRUE, END QUOTE, HE WASN'T THERE WHEN ALL OF THIS STUFF HAPPENED, SO ALL THAT MEANS IS THIS IS WHAT SHE TOLD ME HAPPENED.
POD1000000019_S0000365	AND THAT REALLY MAKES ME WONDER IF JEANNIE CAME UP WITH THIS WHOLE PHIL BLACKMON STORYLINE ON HER OWN AND TRIED TO SELL IT TO THIS GUY AS FACT.
POD1000000019_S0000366	MAYBE HE FIGURED OUT SHE WAS LYING, SO THIS DISCLAIMER IS HIS WAY OF COVERING HIS OWN ASS IN CASE, I DON'T KNOW, AUBREY MAYHEW DECIDED TO SUE THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.
POD1000000019_S0000367	THIS IS ALL OBVIOUSLY WILD SPECULATION ON MY PART, BUT AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER RESPONSE I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE TO THIS PILE OF NONSENSE. THE ATTEMPT AT DISGUISING THE TRUTH IS SO CLUMSY THAT IT EVEN PRESENTS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.
POD1000000019_S0000368	WHICH IS THAT THEY WANTED PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH AND HAVE IT BLOW UP INTO THIS BIG CONTROVERSY TO SELL THE BOOK. THAT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE A BUSINESS STRATEGY SOMEONE MIGHT PICK UP FROM, SAY, WORKING WITH SHELBY SINGLETON.
POD1000000019_S0000369	THE ONLY PROBLEM BEING THAT HARDLY ANYONE READ THIS STUPID BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THERE'S SO MUCH OTHER STUFF IN THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT I DIDN'T EVEN GET INTO.
POD1000000019_S0000370	DEFINITELY DO BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO SEE A WORST CASE EXAMPLE OF A COUNTRY SINGER AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
POD1000000019_S0000371	I HADN'T YET BEEN BROKEN DOWN ENOUGH BY MAKING THIS PODCAST TO JUST START WRITING IN THE BOOKS I READ, OR ELSE WHOEVER ENDS UP WITH MY COPY OF THIS ONE COULD HAVE LOOKED FORWARD TO SOME PRETTY INTENSE SCRIBBLES ALL OVER IT, I'M SURE.
POD1000000019_S0000372	OH, YEAH, BY THE WAY, I AM GIVING AWAY THE BOOKS THAT I READ TO MAKE SEASON ONE OF THIS PODCAST. COCAINEANDRHINESTONES.COM SLASH GIVEAWAY FOR DETAILS ON THAT. YOU COULD END UP WITH MY COPY OF THIS BOOK WITH A LIBRARY CARD IN THE BACK AND EVERYTHING.
POD1000000019_S0000373	A REAL PIECE OF PODCAST HISTORY. OKAY, ALL OF THIS DECEPTION ASIDE, I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO GET AN IDEA OF HOW DIFFERENTLY ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED CAN COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF A HIT SONG.
POD1000000019_S0000374	ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HEARD TODAY IS UNLIKE AS YOU HEARD IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE PODCAST, LORETTA LYNN'S RECORDING OF THE PILL.
POD1000000019_S0000375	THE MUSIC ESTABLISHMENT IN NASHVILLE AND EVERYWHERE ELSE MOSTLY JUST GOT ON BOARD WITH THIS SONG RIGHT AWAY. TEX RITTER DID SAY THAT THE SONG SOUNDED DIRTY AND SUGGESTIVE AND SOME RADIO STATIONS DID BAN IT, BUT WHO CARES?
POD1000000019_S0000376	I LET YOU HEAR IT FROM INDUSTRY GIANTS. YOU HEARD JOHNNY CASH SAY IT WON A GRAMMY AWARD. YOU HEARD ROGER MILLER ANNOUNCE IT AS THE CMA SINGLE OF THE YEAR.
POD1000000019_S0000377	SURE, THE LYRICS AREN'T SCANDALOUS AT ALL COMPARED TO THE PILL, BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THESE TWO SONGS WERE RECEIVED SO DIFFERENTLY BY THE OLD GUARD? I KNOW WHAT I THINK.
POD1000000019_S0000378	I THINK MONEY TALKS. I THINK THAT BY THE TIME ANY OF THOSE WOULD BE BUZZKILLS STARTED PAYING ATTENTION, THIS SONG WAS ALREADY THE NUMBER ONE POP SONG IN AMERICA. AND IT WENT NUMBER ONE POP BEFORE IT WENT NUMBER ONE COUNTRY.
POD1000000019_S0000379	EVERY MAJOR RECORD LABEL IN NASHVILLE HAD BEEN FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF FOR 15 YEARS TRYING TO DO THAT. THEY'D HAVE MADE GENIE C. REILLY THE MAYOR OF NASHVILLE IF SHE DID IT A SECOND TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000380	HER SECOND SINGLE DIDN'T GET THERE, BUT THEY LET HER HANG AROUND A WHILE TO SEE IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN. IT DIDN'T, AND THIS IS THE STORY WE END UP WITH.
POD1000000019_S0000381	BY THE WAY, I COULD ALSO GET INTO A WHOLE OTHER RAMBLE ABOUT NATURE VS NURTURE HERE, YOU KNOW, IS GENIE C. REILLY QUOTE UNQUOTE THE WAY THAT SHE IS NOW?
POD1000000019_S0000382	BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO HER, OR WAS SHE ALWAYS LIKE THAT? I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW. AFTER RECORDING THIS EPISODE, I WAS CHECKING ONE MORE THING, AND I FOUND A PEOPLE MAGAZINE INTERVIEW FROM 1981.
POD1000000019_S0000383	THAT SAYS GENIE WAS BROKE BY THE MID 70S. SO I WAS A LITTLE LATE ON MY GUESS WHEN I SAID IT LOOKED LIKE MONEY PROBLEMS WERE THERE IN THE EARLY 80S, BUT I WAS RIGHT
POD1000000019_S0000384	THEY WERE THERE. IF ANYONE CARES, JEANNIE AND MICKEY DID REMARRY AFTER A SUPER LONG WHO GIVES A SHIT, WILL THEY, WON'T THEY PHASE. IN THAT SAME PEOPLE MAGAZINE ARTICLE I JUST MENTIONED, HE'S QUOTED AS SAYING,
POD1000000019_S0000385	ALSO, AFTER RECORDING THIS EPISODE, I FOUND OUT THAT JEANNIE C. RILEY MISQUOTED THE LA TIMES CRITIC ROBERT HILBURN IN HER BOOK,
POD1000000019_S0000386	BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE DID. ALSO THE REVIEW WAS FROM 1969 SO IT MAKES SO MUCH MORE SENSE KNOWING THAT IT CAME FROM THAT TIME.
POD1000000019_S0000387	THAN TWO YEARS LATER IN 1971, AS JEANNE STATED IN THE BOOK. THIS IS REALLY AGGRAVATING FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS JUST MY FAULT.
POD1000000019_S0000388	THIS IS MY FAULT FOR NOT FACT CHECKING EVERY MINOR DETAIL OF WHAT I WAS USING FROM A SOURCE THAT I KNEW WAS BAD. HERE'S WHAT ROBERT ACTUALLY WROTE IN HIS REVIEW.
POD1000000019_S0000389	QUOTE, MISS RILEY HAS ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD ON STAGE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, LITTLE OF THE TALENT.
POD1000000019_S0000390	NEITHER HER VOICE NOR MOST OF HER MATERIAL, LARGELY DRAWN FROM HER TWO ALBUMS, IS VERY GOOD. THAT IS TWO STRIKES.
POD1000000019_S0000391	THE DAY THE PUBLIC FORGETS HARPER VALLEY PTA MAY MEAN THREE." THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS WRITTEN THERE AND WHAT I QUOTED IN THE EPISODE MAY SEEM SO SMALL AS TO NOT BE NOTICEABLE BY SOME OF YOU, BUT IT'S THERE AND I DO SEE IT.
POD1000000019_S0000392	MY RESPONSE IN THE EPISODE TO GENIE'S VERSION OF THIS REVIEW IS HARSHER THAN WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I WAS REACTING TO THE REAL REVIEW.
POD1000000019_S0000393	SO, IF ROBERT HILBURN HAPPENS TO BE LISTENING TO THIS, I DO APOLOGIZE TO YOU, SIR. WE MAY STILL DISAGREE ABOUT SOMETHING YOU WROTE NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO,
POD1000000019_S0000394	BUT NOT NEARLY AS STRONGLY AS I THOUGHT WHEN READING AND REACTING TO IT SECONDHAND. OKAY, THERE ARE NO MORE BOOKS TO TALK ABOUT AS SOURCES FOR THIS ONE.
POD1000000019_S0000395	LOTS OF GOOD VIDEO CLIPS ON COCAINEANDRINESTONES.COM. SO MAKE SURE TO GO WATCH THOSE TO GET THE FULL PICTURE OF SOME THINGS I TALKED ABOUT. COME BACK NEXT WEEK, WE'RE PUTTING THIS BABY TO BED. IT'S THE END OF THE HARBOR VALLEY PTA SERIES.
POD1000000019_S0000396	WE'RE TALKING TOM T. HALL ON COCAINE AND RHINESTONES.
POD1000000021_S0000001	IS IT TRUE THAT HE'S KIND OF A PRIVATE AND QUIET, LIKE INTROVERTED PERSON WHEN HE'S BY HIMSELF?
POD1000000021_S0000002	ARE YOU ASKING ME OR HIM?
POD1000000021_S0000004	ASKING HIM IF YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN TOO, THAT'S FINE.
POD1000000021_S0000005	HE DEFINITELY IS.
POD1000000021_S0000006	THAT'S TRINA EDWARDS. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND, EDWIN EDWARDS, THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000007	TRINA IS ALMOST 42, AND EDWIN WILL BE 93 IN AUGUST.
POD1000000021_S0000008	SHE WAS PASSING ALONG MY QUESTIONS BECAUSE HE HAS A HARD TIME HEARING OVER THE PHONE.
POD1000000021_S0000009	IS IT TRUE THAT YOU'RE A QUIET KIND OF INTROVERTED PERSON WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE HOME BY YOURSELF?
POD1000000021_S0000010	WELL, I'M A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON WHEN I'M NOT ON THE STAGE.
POD1000000021_S0000011	THAT'S THE WAY I AM. I'M VERY QUIET AND PRIVATE AND I DON'T DRINK AT ALL.
POD1000000021_S0000012	I DON'T USE DRUGS AT ALL. AND SO NOW, THE MOST FUN I HAVE IN LIFE IS TAKING CARE OF MY SEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD.
POD1000000021_S0000013	AND MY WIFE.
POD1000000021_S0000014	OKAY.
POD1000000021_S0000015	TRINA IS EDWIN'S THIRD WIFE.
POD1000000021_S0000016	THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED SINCE 2011.
POD1000000021_S0000017	THE TWO OF THEM MET WHEN SHE STARTED WRITING HIM LETTERS IN FEDERAL PRISON.
POD1000000021_S0000018	EDWARD SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES.
POD1000000021_S0000019	HE WAS CONVICTED OF RIGGING CASINO LICENSES DURING HIS FINAL TERM AS GOVERNOR.
POD1000000021_S0000020	WHEN HE GOT OUT, HE AND TRINA BROUGHT THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO REALITY TV.
POD1000000021_S0000022	THEIR SHOW WENT OFF THE AIR AFTER EIGHT EPISODES.
POD1000000021_S0000023	SINCE THEN, EDWARDS HAS RUN FOR CONGRESS AND LOST, AND HE'S HAD A COUPLE OF HEALTH SCARES.
POD1000000021_S0000024	BUT HE STILL HAS A REMARKABLE COMMAND OF LOUISIANA POLITICAL HISTORY, MUCH OF WHICH HE SHAPED DURING HIS FOUR TERMS AS GOVERNOR.
POD1000000021_S0000025	TO UNDERSTAND DAVID DUKE, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES LOUISIANA POLITICS DISTINCTIVE.
POD1000000021_S0000026	THE UNIQUE ALLIANCES, THE ENTRENCHED CORRUPTION, AND THE CHARISMATIC FIGURES WHO'VE MOLDED THE STATE IN THEIR OWN IMAGES.
POD1000000021_S0000027	AND EDWIN EDWARDS IS LOUISIANA POLITICS PERSONIFIED.
POD1000000021_S0000028	EDWARDS'S FIRST GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN BEGAN IN 1971.
POD1000000021_S0000029	FIRST OF ALL, I SPOKE FRENCH AND IN 1971 THERE WERE STILL PEOPLE, OLDER PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WHO UNDERSTOOD ENGLISH BUT THEY PREFERRED TO HEAR AND SPEAK IN FRENCH.
POD1000000021_S0000030	SO I MADE SOME FRANCHISE AND IT HELPED ME WITH THAT PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE.
POD1000000021_S0000031	I MEAN, HE HAD A COALITION, A DISTINCTLY LOUISIANA COALITION. HE HAD CAJUNS AND BLACKS.
POD1000000021_S0000032	THAT'S MARC MORIAL. HE WORKED WITH EDWARDS AS A STATE LEGISLATOR AND AS THE MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS.
POD1000000021_S0000033	IN LOUISIANA, IF YOU CAN PUT THOSE TWO VOTING BASES TOGETHER, IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN UNBEATABLE COALITION.
POD1000000021_S0000034	UNLIKE MOST OF HIS WHITE DEMOCRATIC PEERS, EDWARDS WAS AN UNABASHED CIVIL RIGHTS CHAMPION.
POD1000000021_S0000035	HE INVITED BLACK LOUISIANANS TO WORK IN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS AND HELPED CRAFT A STATE CONSTITUTION THAT OUTLAWED DISCRIMINATION.
POD1000000021_S0000036	HE ALSO MADE LOUISIANA RICHER.
POD1000000021_S0000037	AS GOVERNOR, EDWARDS HELPED CHANGE HOW CRUDE OIL GOT TAXED.
POD1000000021_S0000038	MOVING FROM A FLAT FEE PER BARREL TO A PERCENTAGE OF THE BARREL PRICE. WHEN OIL PRICES SHOT UP, STATE REVENUES SOARED.
POD1000000021_S0000039	SO DID EDWIN EDWARDS'S POPULARITY.
POD1000000021_S0000040	STORIES ABOUT EDWARDS' GAMBLING AND WOMANIZING DIDN'T HURT HIM WITH VOTERS.
POD1000000021_S0000041	THE MIASMA OF CORRUPTION AND SCANDAL THAT HUNG OVER HIS ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T DAMAGE HIM EITHER.
POD1000000021_S0000042	THERE WERE SIX GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS DURING EDWARDS' FIRST TERM.
POD1000000021_S0000043	BUT HE WASN'T INDICTED IN ANY OF THOSE CASES.
POD1000000021_S0000044	IT SEEMED LIKE THE SILVER HAIRED, SILVER TONGUED GOVERNOR COULD TALK HIS WAY OUT OF ANYTHING.
POD1000000021_S0000045	WHEN ASKED ABOUT SOME IFFY POLITICAL DONATIONS, EDWARDS SAID, IT WAS ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO GIVE, BUT NOT FOR ME TO RECEIVE.
POD1000000021_S0000046	EDWARDS LED LOUISIANA FOR EIGHT YEARS, LEAVING OFFICE IN MARCH 1980.
POD1000000021_S0000047	THE ONLY THING STOPPING HIM FROM BEING GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WERE TERM LIMITS THAT EDWARDS HIMSELF HAD PUSHED FOR.
POD1000000021_S0000048	SO HE WENT ON A BRIEF HIATUS, SITTING OUT THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE, THEN RETURNING IN 1983 TO RECLAIM HIS THRONE.
POD1000000021_S0000049	IN THE LAST DAYS OF THAT CAMPAIGN, EDWARDS FIRED OFF HIS MOST FAMOUS ONE LINER.
POD1000000021_S0000050	THE ONLY WAY I CAN LOSE THIS ELECTION IS IF I GOT CAUGHT IN BED WITH A DEAD GIRL OR A LIVE BOY.
POD1000000021_S0000051	AND THAT TOOK ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN AND HAS BEEN QUOTED MANY TIMES SINCE BY OTHER PEOPLE.
POD1000000021_S0000052	IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH?
POD1000000021_S0000053	YEAH, THANK YOU, TRINA. DOES HE REGRET SAYING THAT OR IS HE HAPPY THAT HE SAID IT?
POD1000000021_S0000055	I GUARANTEE HE DOESN'T REGRET ANYTHING HE'S EVER DONE. HOLD ON.
POD1000000021_S0000056	DO YOU REGRET SAYING THAT? OR ARE YOU HAPPY YOU SAID THAT?
POD1000000021_S0000057	NO, IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAID THAT PEOPLE IDENTIFIED WITH ME AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY.
POD1000000021_S0000058	EDWARDS WAS RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT 1983 ELECTION WAS A LOCK. HE'D WIN IT WITH 62% OF THE VOTE.
POD1000000021_S0000059	TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY, HE DID SOMETHING AUDACIOUS, EVEN BY EDWIN EDWARDS STANDARDS.
POD1000000021_S0000061	IF THERE'S ONE THING LOUISIANA GOVERNOR ELECT EDWIN EDWARDS KNOWS, IT'S HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME, EVEN WITH A $4 MILLION CAMPAIGN DEFICIT STARING HIM DOWN.
POD1000000021_S0000062	EDWARDS CHARTERED TWO JUMBO JETS, ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO PARIS, AND INVITED ANYONE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE $10,000 TO COME ON ALONG.
POD1000000021_S0000063	MORE THAN 600 PEOPLE JOINED EDWARDS ON THAT TRIP TO FRANCE, WHICH WAS TOUTED AS THE LARGEST SINGLE POLITICAL FUNDRAISER EVER THROWN BY AN AMERICAN POLITICIAN.
POD1000000021_S0000064	THE WRITER ROY BLUNT JR., ON ASSIGNMENT FOR PEOPLE MAGAZINE, WENT ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
POD1000000021_S0000065	YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE DEAL DID NOT SMELL OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.
POD1000000021_S0000066	THAT'S FOR SURE. BUT AS SOME PEOPLE SAID, IT'S HARD TO BE PROPER AND HAVE A REAL GOOD TIME.
POD1000000021_S0000067	THE FRENCH SPEAKING EDWARDS AND HIS CREW OF LOUISIANANS ATE HIGH CLASS CUISINE AT THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES.
POD1000000021_S0000068	THE GOVERNOR ALSO RECEIVED A WARM GREETING FROM A NUN OUTSIDE NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL.
POD1000000021_S0000069	AND SHE GAVE HIM WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS A FRENCH KISS, WHICH WAS ACTUALLY, OF COURSE, MORE LIKE A NUN'S KISS.
POD1000000021_S0000070	BUT SHE COULD TAKE A JOKE AND SO HE SAID, OKAY SISTER, BUT JUST DON'T LET ME GET INTO THE HABIT.
POD1000000021_S0000071	AND ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS GATHERED AROUND, CHEERED AND BEAMED.
POD1000000021_S0000072	AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THEY HAD COME TO PARIS FOR.
POD1000000021_S0000073	THE PARTY ENDED FOR EDWIN EDWARDS AS SOON AS THOSE JUMBO JETS LANDED BACK IN LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000074	THE CAMPAIGN OF 83 WAS GREAT. IT WAS ONE OF THE FUNNEST EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE.
POD1000000021_S0000075	THE SERVICE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FROM 84 TO 87, IT WAS NOT.
POD1000000021_S0000076	IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE.
POD1000000021_S0000077	THAT'S SID MORELAND. HE WAS EDWIN EDWARDS' ASSISTANT.
POD1000000021_S0000078	BY THE MID 1980S, OIL AND GAS REVENUES HAD PLUMMETED, AND THE STATE WAS FACING A HUGE DEFICIT.
POD1000000021_S0000079	EDWARDS TRIED TO FILL THAT HOLE WITH TAX INCREASES.
POD1000000021_S0000080	HIS CONSTITUENTS DIDN'T FIND THAT RAKISH OR CHARMING.
POD1000000021_S0000081	YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO RAISE TAXES ON PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING ALREADY, IT'S A VERY PRECARIOUS POLITICAL SITUATION TO BE IN.
POD1000000021_S0000082	SO THIS TAX PACKAGE WAS PROBABLY THE BEGINNING OF HIS UNPOPULARITY.
POD1000000021_S0000083	IN FEBRUARY 1985, EDWIN EDWARDS'S RUN OF BAD LUCK.
POD1000000021_S0000084	GOT A WHOLE LOT WORSE.
POD1000000021_S0000085	THE 50 COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT CHARGES GOVERNOR EDWARDS AND SIX OTHERS INCLUDING HIS BROTHER AND A NEPHEW
POD1000000021_S0000086	WITH RACKETEERING AND FRAUD IN A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR SCHEME INVOLVING THE EFFECTIVE SALE OF STATE APPROVAL FOR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.
POD1000000021_S0000087	EDWARDS WAS ACCUSED, BASICALLY, OF ACCEPTING BRIBES TO STEER STATE MONEY TO HIS FRIENDS.
POD1000000021_S0000088	THE TRIAL DRAGGED ON, SOMEHOW, FOR 14 WEEKS.
POD1000000021_S0000089	MORELAND SPENT MOST OF IT ON A PAYPHONE OUTSIDE THE NEW ORLEANS COURTROOM.
POD1000000021_S0000090	I WAS CONSTANTLY CALLING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN BATON ROUGE AND GETTING THE PHONE MESSAGES.
POD1000000021_S0000091	AND RETURNING THOSE PHONE CALLS AND EXPLAINING TO PEOPLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNOR CAN'T TALK TO YOU RIGHT THIS MINUTE.
POD1000000021_S0000092	AND WE TRIED TO BE AS DIPLOMATIC ABOUT IT AS WE COULD.
POD1000000021_S0000093	AND OF COURSE, MOST PEOPLE KNEW WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH, BUT THEY CALLED ANYWAY.
POD1000000021_S0000094	THE CASE ENDED IN A MISTRIAL. EDWARDS WAS LATER RETRIED AND FOUND NOT GUILTY.
POD1000000021_S0000095	WHEN THAT VERDICT CAME IN, THE PROSECUTOR SAID, IF WE DIDN'T MAKE HIM HONEST, I HOPE WE MADE HIM SORRY.
POD1000000021_S0000096	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE CASE, HE DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT SORRY.
POD1000000021_S0000097	THAT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF A STUPID PROSECUTOR WHO DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
POD1000000021_S0000098	DID IT BOTHER HIM WHEN PEOPLE SAID HE WAS PROFITING FROM HIS ROLE AS THE GOVERNOR?
POD1000000021_S0000099	DID IT BOTHER YOU WHEN PEOPLE SAID YOU WERE PROFITING FROM YOUR ROLE AS GOVERNOR?
POD1000000021_S0000100	NO, BECAUSE...
POD1000000021_S0000102	THERE'S NO TRUTH TO IT, SO IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL. I JUST LAUGHED ABOUT IT.
POD1000000021_S0000103	EDWARDS MAY HAVE BEEN LAUGHING, BUT HE WAS STILL IN A PRECARIOUS SPOT.
POD1000000021_S0000104	IN GOOD TIMES, MOST PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA LOVED HIS MISADVENTURES.
POD1000000021_S0000105	BUT THESE WEREN'T GOOD TIMES. THE BOOM YEARS OF THE 1970S WERE LONG GONE.
POD1000000021_S0000106	IN 1987, LOUISIANA WAS READY FOR A CHANGE.
POD1000000021_S0000107	I NOTICE MY OPPONENTS DON'T MAKE MANY PEOPLE ANGRY.
POD1000000021_S0000108	THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE YOU, DOES IT? POLITICS AS USUAL.
POD1000000021_S0000109	I DON'T LIKE LOUISIANA POLITICS. I LOVE LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000110	I LOVE LOUISIANA ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE ANGRY.
POD1000000021_S0000111	BUDDY ROMER WAS A CONGRESSMAN FROM NORTH LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000112	IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS OF THE 1987 GOVERNOR'S RACE, HE'S ZOOMED FROM FIFTH TO FIRST IN THE POLLS, BUOYED BY FOLKSY TV ADS AND A STRING OF NEWSPAPER ENDORSEMENTS.
POD1000000021_S0000113	ROMER LED EDWARDS BY FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING.
POD1000000021_S0000114	SETTING THE STAGE FOR A RUNOFF. BUT WHEN EDWARDS EMERGED AFTER 1 A.M. TO GREET HIS SUPPORTERS, HE MADE A MOVE THAT NOBODY HAD ANTICIPATED.
POD1000000021_S0000115	AND I HAVE DETERMINED THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, SINCE I DID NOT RUN FIRST,
POD1000000021_S0000116	THAT IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO CONTINUE THIS ELECTION.
POD1000000021_S0000117	SUPPORTERS WERE STUNNED. SOME OF HIS FAMILY CRIED.
POD1000000021_S0000119	HE'S 60. HE'S BEEN GOVERNOR 12 YEARS.
POD1000000021_S0000120	HE SAID THAT'S LONG ENOUGH. MOST VOTERS THOUGHT SO TOO.
POD1000000021_S0000121	THERE WOULD BE NO RUNOFF. ROMER WOULD BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000122	AND EDWIN EDWARDS? IT LOOKED TO OUTSIDE OBSERVERS LIKE HIS CAREER WAS FINISHED.
POD1000000021_S0000123	BUT THAT'S NOT HOW EDWARD SAW IT. DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE, THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN HIS COMEBACK PLAN.
POD1000000021_S0000124	I SPOKE WITH HIM THAT NIGHT AND HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RESOLUTE THAT, OH, LOOK, I'M GOING TO LET HIM HAVE IT.
POD1000000021_S0000125	I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO HIM. HE'S BEEN GOING ALL OVER THIS STATE SAYING HE'S GOING TO FIX THIS. HE'S GOING TO FIX THAT.
POD1000000021_S0000126	AND HE'S GONNA DISINTEGRATE, YOU MARK MY WORD.
POD1000000021_S0000128	EDWARDS HAD IT ALL MAPPED OUT. HE WOULD LET ROMER RUN THE STATE FOR A FEW DIFFICULT YEARS, THEN RE EMERGE TO SAVE THE DAY.
POD1000000021_S0000129	IT WOULDN'T BE THAT SIMPLE. THE 1991 ELECTION WOULD BE ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN WHO GOT TO SLEEP IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION.
POD1000000021_S0000130	IT'D BE A FIGHT OVER WHAT LOUISIANA WAS, AND WHAT IT SHOULD BE.
POD1000000021_S0000131	AND EDWIN EDWARDS AND BUDDY ROMER WOULDN'T BE THE ONLY ONES IN THAT BATTLE.
POD1000000021_S0000133	IN 1991, DAVID DUKE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS.
POD1000000021_S0000134	HE TONED HIS MESSAGE, BUILT A RABID FAN BASE, AND COMES SHOCKINGLY CLOSE TO GETTING ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE.
POD1000000021_S0000135	THE GOVERNOR'S RACE WOULD BE THE CULMINATION OF HIS LIFE'S WORK.
POD1000000021_S0000136	THIS WAS DUKE'S CHANCE TO TURN HIS WORDS INTO ACTIONS, TO TAKE CONTROL OF AN ENTIRE STATE AND MAKE IT INTO WHATEVER HE WANTED.
POD1000000021_S0000137	THIS IS SLOW BURN. I'M JOSH LEVINE. EPISODE 5, THE ROAD TO HELL.
POD1000000021_S0000139	WHAT'S THE NUMBER ONE SIGN OF A BAD HOME SECURITY SYSTEM? IT'S SO COMPLICATED THAT YOU NEVER USE IT.
POD1000000021_S0000140	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SIMPLISAFE HAS SPENT A DECADE FIGHTING AGAINST.

POD1000000021_S0000152	WHEN EDWIN EDWARDS WAS THREE YEARS OLD, THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA HAD A MAN KIDNAPPED.
POD1000000021_S0000153	IT WAS 1930, AND THE GOVERNOR WAS HUEY LONG.
POD1000000021_S0000154	THE GUY WHO GOT SNATCHED WAS ABOUT TO EXPOSE RAMPANT GRAFT IN STATE GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000021_S0000155	FOUR DAYS AFTER HE DISAPPEARED, THE VICTIM REEMERGED TO SAY, NOT AT ALL CREDIBLY, THAT HE'D STAGED THE KIDNAPPING HIMSELF.
POD1000000021_S0000156	IN A RADIO BROADCAST, THE MAN ANNOUNCED THAT GOVERNOR HUEY LONG WAS HIS BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD.
POD1000000021_S0000157	LONG WAS SHOT AND KILLED AT THE STATE CAPITOL FIVE YEARS LATER.
POD1000000021_S0000158	A LOT OF PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WILL TELL YOU THAT HE WAS THE BEST FRIEND THE STATE EVER HAD.
POD1000000021_S0000159	YES, LONG WAS A CORRUPT DICTATOR. AND SURE, HE ORCHESTRATED A KIDNAPPING.
POD1000000021_S0000160	BUT HE ALSO BUILT BRIDGES AND HOSPITALS, AND PAID FOR IT ALL WITH MONEY HE'D PRIED FREE FROM THE BIG OIL COMPANIES.
POD1000000021_S0000161	EDWIN EDWARDS CARRIED ON HUEY LONG'S TRADITION OF ECONOMIC POPULISM.
POD1000000021_S0000162	LIKE LONG, EDWARDS USED MONEY SNATCHED FROM BIG OIL TO BUILD BRIDGES AND HOSPITALS.
POD1000000021_S0000163	ALL THAT, AND HE FINISHED CONSTRUCTION OF THE LOUISIANA SUPERDOME.
POD1000000021_S0000164	DAVID DUKE, ON THE OTHER HAND, SAID HE WOULDN'T FOLLOW LONG'S EXAMPLE.
POD1000000021_S0000165	WE NEED ANOTHER POPULIST. NOT A POPULIST LIKE HUEY LONG FOR MORE GOVERNMENT, BUT A POPULIST FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA FOR LESS GOVERNMENT AND MORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
POD1000000021_S0000167	IN REALITY, DUKE'S BRAND OF POPULISM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SHRINKING GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000021_S0000168	IT WAS BUILT ON RACIAL RESENTMENT.
POD1000000021_S0000169	DUKE'S MESSAGE, THE JOURNALIST JOHN MCGINNIS WROTE, HELD A LOT OF APPEAL FOR THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF HUEY LONG'S OLD VOTERS.
POD1000000021_S0000170	I DOUBT THAT DUKE CARED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ABOUT LONG'S POLICIES, BUT HE DID RESPECT THE MAN'S POWER AND FAME, AND REFERENCED IT TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT HIS OWN CELEBRITY.
POD1000000021_S0000171	THE LADIES THAT DO THE TOURS OF THE STATE CAPITOL, NOT FAR FROM HERE, THEY ALWAYS TELL ME, THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S TWO THINGS PEOPLE WANT TO SEE WHEN THEY COME TO THE STATE CAPITOL IN BATON ROUGE.
POD1000000021_S0000172	THEY WANT TO SEE WHERE HUEY LONG WAS SHOT AND WHERE DAVID DUKE SITS.
POD1000000021_S0000174	BUDDY ROMER OFFERED VOTERS A THIRD OPTION, A COMPLETE BREAK FROM THE SLEAZE AND SELF DEALING THAT HAD MARRED LOUISIANA POLITICS FROM THE LONG ERA TO THE PRESENT DAY.
POD1000000021_S0000175	THE HARVARD EDUCATED ROAMER SAID THAT LONG'S LEGACY WAS SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.
POD1000000021_S0000176	SOMEBODY ELSE PAYS.
POD1000000021_S0000177	ROMER PROMISED A NEW ERA OF RESPONSIBILITY, ONE THAT WOULD EARN HIS HOME STATE NATIONAL RESPECT.
POD1000000021_S0000178	HE CALLED THIS THE ROMER REVOLUTION.
POD1000000021_S0000179	MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA WILL NEVER COME TO LOUISIANA. MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA WILL KNOW US ONLY BY OUR REPUTATION.
POD1000000021_S0000180	I'LL PUT LOUISIANA FIRST AND WE'LL MAKE THEM STOP LAUGHING AND START LISTENING.
POD1000000021_S0000181	ROMER'S BIG INITIATIVE WAS A PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO TAXATION.
POD1000000021_S0000182	ONE DAY EARLY AND WITH VOTES TO SPARE, TAX REFORM FINALLY MADE IT THROUGH THE LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE.
POD1000000021_S0000183	WE'RE TALKING A NEW WAY OF APPROACHING OUR OLD PROBLEMS THAT ARE EATING US ALIVE.
POD1000000021_S0000184	ROMER WAS ADAMANT THAT HIS FISCAL REFORM PLAN WAS NOT A TAX INCREASE.
POD1000000021_S0000185	HE SAID IT WOULD JUST SHIFT MORE OF THE BURDEN TO PEOPLE WITH HIGHER INCOMES.
POD1000000021_S0000186	IN THE SPRING OF 1989, HE MADE THAT PITCH TO LOUISIANA'S VOTERS, WHO NEEDED TO APPROVE THE PROPOSAL IN A STATEWIDE REFERENDUM.
POD1000000021_S0000187	DAVID DUKE, THEN A NEWLY ELECTED STATE LEGISLATOR, WAS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S MOST OUTSPOKEN CRITICS.
POD1000000021_S0000188	OVERALL, IT'S A $625 MILLION TAX INCREASE, AND THIS FROM A GOVERNOR WHO SWORE TO US HE WOULD NOT RAISE TAXES.
POD1000000021_S0000189	I'M GONNA IGNORE DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000190	I MEAN, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE AMERICAN NAZI PARTY THINKS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.
POD1000000021_S0000191	A LOT OF PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA DID CARE WHAT DAVID DUKE HAD TO SAY.
POD1000000021_S0000192	DUKE STAGED A SERIES OF RALLIES ACROSS THE STATE, RAILING AGAINST ROMER AND PRESENTING HIMSELF AS THE CHAMPION OF THE WORKING CLASS.
POD1000000021_S0000193	AT ONE EVENT, A LOUISIANA ANTI TAX TEA PARTY, HE CLIMBED ABOARD A RIVERBOAT AND TOSSED SOME TEA INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
POD1000000021_S0000194	YOU DON'T RAISE TAXES IN A RECESSION, DUKE SAID.
POD1000000021_S0000195	YOU DON'T TAX YOUR WAY INTO PROSPERITY.
POD1000000021_S0000196	THE BLUES ON THE STREETS OF NEW ORLEANS ARE NOW BEING SUNG IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION AFTER VOTERS RESOUNDINGLY REJECTED NEW TAXES.
POD1000000021_S0000197	DIGGING LOUISIANA'S ALREADY TROUBLED ECONOMY EVER DEEPER IN DEBT, AND FORCING REFORM MINDED GOVERNOR BUDDY ROMER TO SCRAMBLE HIS WAY OUT OF A NEW FINANCIAL CRISIS.
POD1000000021_S0000198	AS OF MAY 1989, THE ROMA REVOLUTION WAS PRETTY MUCH DEAD.
POD1000000021_S0000199	LATER THAT YEAR, ROMER'S WIFE, PATTY, LEFT HIM. WHEN THE POLITICAL CONSULTANT, RAYMOND STROTHER, VISITED ROMER IN EARLY 1991,
POD1000000021_S0000200	THE GOVERNOR WAS STILL IN A DEEP FUNK.
POD1000000021_S0000201	HE SAID, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU. I NEED YOUR HELP.
POD1000000021_S0000202	HE SAID, I NEED TO WRITE A LETTER TO PATTY.
POD1000000021_S0000203	I KNOW I'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES, BUT HE SAID, I WANT HER TO COME HOME. AND HE SAID, HELP ME WRITE THIS LETTER. YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER.
POD1000000021_S0000204	STROTHER SAID THAT HE WASN'T THE MAN FOR THAT JOB.
POD1000000021_S0000205	HIS OWN WIFE HAD JUST LEFT HIM A FEW WEEKS EARLIER.
POD1000000021_S0000206	BUT STROTHER, WHO'D HELPED ROMER WIN IN 1987, WAS AVAILABLE TO WORK ON THE GOVERNOR'S RE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
POD1000000021_S0000208	HE SAID, MOVE INTO THE MANSION, AND I DID.
POD1000000021_S0000209	AND IT WAS NICE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A DRY CLEANER DOWNSTAIRS AND YOU PUT YOUR SHOES OUTSIDE THE DOOR EVERY NIGHT AND THEY COME, THEY START THE NEXT DAY, SHINE.
POD1000000021_S0000210	AND EVERY NIGHT WHEN I'D GO TO MY ROOM, THERE'D BE A PICTURE OF MILK AND ICE AND SOME STILL WARM COOKIES.
POD1000000021_S0000211	HOW GOOD WERE THE COOKIES?
POD1000000021_S0000212	THE COOKIES WERE SPLENDID.
POD1000000021_S0000213	THEY WERE BAKED EVERY AFTERNOON AND SOMETIMES AGAIN JUST BEFORE BREAKFAST.
POD1000000021_S0000214	SO I ALWAYS HAD FRESH COOKS THAT COULD PROBABLY GAIN 10 POUNDS. I WAS ALREADY FAT, SO.
POD1000000021_S0000215	APART FROM THE COOKIES, STROTHER HAS NO FOND MEMORIES OF WORKING ON ROMER'S RE ELECTION.
POD1000000021_S0000216	THE FIRST BIG CONFLICT CAME WHEN A NEW AG ROMER ADVISOR NAMED DANNY WALKER SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR WEAR A RUBBER BAND AROUND HIS WRIST.
POD1000000021_S0000217	AND HE SAID, WELL, EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A BAD THOUGHT, IF YOU'LL POP THAT RUBBER BAND AND CAUSE A LITTLE PAIN, PRETTY SOON YOU WON'T BE HAVING BAD THOUGHTS.
POD1000000021_S0000218	I SAID, YOU KEEP YOUR DAMN RUBBER BANDS YOURSELF, DANNY.
POD1000000021_S0000219	ROMER ACTUALLY LIKED THE RUBBER BAND IDEA.
POD1000000021_S0000220	THE GOVERNOR ALSO EMBRACED ROBERT FULGHAM'S BOOK
POD1000000021_S0000221	ALL I REALLY NEED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN, WHICH TOUTED THE VIRTUES OF SHARING EVERYTHING AND PLAYING FAIR.
POD1000000021_S0000222	BUDDY WAS INTO THAT GURU SORT OF STUFF TOUCHY FEELY
POD1000000021_S0000223	I CAN'T STAND THAT KIND OF THING.
POD1000000021_S0000224	AFTER READING THAT SELF HELP GUIDE, THE GOVERNOR DECIDED HE'D BEEN TOO ABRASIVE.
POD1000000021_S0000225	IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS, ROMER APOLOGIZED TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HIS INFLEXIBILITY AND INSENSITIVITY.
POD1000000021_S0000226	LET'S SAY GOODBYE TO ME AND HELLO TO WE.
POD1000000021_S0000227	LET'S SAY GOODBYE TO LIONS IN THE SAND.
POD1000000021_S0000228	FOR STROTHER, THE SELF HELP STUFF WAS BAD, BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS WORSE.
POD1000000021_S0000230	ONE DAY AT THE MANSION, HE HAPPENED UPON A MEETING THAT HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT.
POD1000000021_S0000231	I SAW MARY MATLIN, A WHOLE BUNCH OF HIGH ECHELON REPUBLICANS SITTING AROUND THE TABLE, THE DINING ROOM TABLE WITH BUDDY.
POD1000000021_S0000232	AND I SAID, OH MY GOD.
POD1000000021_S0000233	ROMER HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSERVATIVE.
POD1000000021_S0000234	AS A CONGRESSMAN, HE TENDED TO VOTE WITH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN AND AGAINST HIS OWN DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
POD1000000021_S0000235	BUT STRUTHER SAYS ROMER HAD ALWAYS ASSURED HIM HE WOULDN'T MOVE TO THE GOP.
POD1000000021_S0000236	HE BROKE THAT PROMISE IN MARCH 1991.
POD1000000021_S0000237	ROMER EXPLAINED HIMSELF AT A PRESS CONFERENCE OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, WHERE PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH HAD JUST WELCOMED HIM INTO THE REPUBLICAN FOLD.
POD1000000021_S0000238	I WOULD SAY THAT PARTY'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN AMERICA. FAMILIES ARE, INTEGRITY, IDEALS, COMMITMENT, PRINCIPLES.
POD1000000021_S0000239	THOSE ARE MORE IMPORTANT. AND ON THOSE ISSUES, I NEVER CHANGE.
POD1000000021_S0000240	BUT WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL ACTION, I WILL BE A REPUBLICAN AND PROUDLY WORK IN THE PARTY.
POD1000000021_S0000241	ROMER WAS THE FIRST SITTING GOVERNOR IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY TO SWITCH PARTIES.
POD1000000021_S0000242	IDEOLOGY ASIDE, ROMER THOUGHT THE MOVE WAS SMART STRATEGY.
POD1000000021_S0000243	EDWIN EDWARDS WAS GOING TO GRAB VOTES FROM HIS LEFT, NO MATTER WHAT.
POD1000000021_S0000244	ROMER FIGURED THAT BRANDING HIMSELF A REPUBLICAN WOULD HELP STAVE OFF RIGHT WING CHALLENGERS WHO MIGHT THREATEN HIS RE ELECTION.
POD1000000021_S0000245	THE STATEWIDE POLL SHOWED THAT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES ARE DUKE, EDWARDS AND MYSELF.
POD1000000021_S0000246	AND IN THE LAST POLL, I WAS IN THE 40S, EDWARDS IN THE 30S.
POD1000000021_S0000247	AND DUKE 10, 11, OR 12 WITH SOME UNDECIDED. I FELT GOOD ABOUT THE POLITICS.
POD1000000021_S0000248	RAYMOND STROTHER DID NOT FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE POLITICS.
POD1000000021_S0000249	IT WAS A DUMB MOVE FOR HIM AND ME. IT WAS JUST A DUMB MOVE.
POD1000000021_S0000250	DEMOCRATS IN LOUISIANA FELT BURNED BY ROMER. AND REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING STATE PARTY OFFICIALS, WEREN'T SURE THEY COULD TRUST HIM EITHER.
POD1000000021_S0000251	BILLY NUNGESSER, THE REPUBLICAN CHAIR WHO'D UNDERCUT THE EFFORT TO CENSURE DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000252	RESENTED THAT ROMER HADN'T INCLUDED HIM IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PARTY SWITCH. AND ROMER, FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF ALL I EVER NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN, CURSED OUT NUNGESSER RATHER THAN TRYING TO APPEASE HIM.
POD1000000021_S0000253	THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICANS MADE THEIR ENDORSEMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE AT A STATE CONVENTION IN JUNE 1991.
POD1000000021_S0000254	THAT ENDORSEMENT WOULDN'T GO TO BUDDY ROMER OR DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000255	THE GOP'S CHOICE WAS A PRO LIFE CONGRESSMAN NAMED CLYDE HOLLOWAY, THE PREFERRED CANDIDATE OF THE CHRISTIAN COALITION.
POD1000000021_S0000256	ROMER, KNOWING THAT HE WOULDN'T GET ENDORSED, DIDN'T BOTHER TO SHOW UP AT THE CONVENTION.
POD1000000021_S0000257	BUT DUKE AND HIS SUPPORTERS MADE THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN.
POD1000000021_S0000258	HERE'S HOW THE ANTI DUKE ACTIVIST BETH RICKEY DESCRIBED THE SCENE IN 1991.
POD1000000021_S0000259	IT WAS LIKE A DUKE CONVENTION. THEY WERE JUST BOOING INDISCRIMINATELY ANYTHING AND EVERYBODY AND THEY WERE JUST WILD AND THEY WERE
POD1000000021_S0000260	THEN DUKE WAS EGGING THEM ON, YOU KNOW, TO DISRUPT THINGS.
POD1000000021_S0000261	THEY HAD TO SING DIXIE TO QUIET THEM DOWN. QUITE LITERALLY. THEY TRIED, GOD BLESS AMERICA,
POD1000000021_S0000262	AND THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC, BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THEY SANG, I WISH I WERE IN THE LAND OF COTTON THAT THE HUSH FELL OVER THE CONVENTION.
POD1000000021_S0000263	BUDDY ROMER HAD TRIED TO CONSOLIDATE THE CONSERVATIVE VOTE.
POD1000000021_S0000264	THAT PLAN HAD BEEN A TOTAL FAILURE.
POD1000000021_S0000265	THE SPLINTERING OF THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD BE A GIFT TO EDWIN EDWARDS. AND TO DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000266	LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
POD1000000021_S0000269	NOW IS THE TIME TO CATCH UP ON THE PODCASTS YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LISTEN TO.
POD1000000021_S0000270	AND SO MANY OF THEM ARE AVAILABLE ON LUMINARY.

POD1000000021_S0000274	HOSTED BY AWARD WINNING JOURNALIST SOLEDAD O'BRIEN.
POD1000000021_S0000275	MURDER ON THE TOWPATH EXPLORES THE 1964 MURDER OF MARY PINSCHOWMEIER.
POD1000000021_S0000276	IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF GEORGETOWN IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
POD1000000021_S0000277	HER DEATH RESULTED IN A TRIAL THAT ROCKED THE COUNTRY.
POD1000000021_S0000278	AND BECAME A TIME CAPSULE OF ALL THE RACIAL TENSION, SCANDAL AND DISTRUST OF THE 1960S.

POD1000000021_S0000284	NO OTHER STATE DOES ELECTIONS LIKE LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000285	THE CREDIT FOR THAT, OR THE BLAME, BELONGS TO EDWIN EDWARDS.
POD1000000021_S0000286	THE FIRST TIME HE RAN FOR GOVERNOR, EDWARDS HAD TO COMPETE IN THREE SEPARATE RACES.
POD1000000021_S0000287	A CLOSED DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, A DEMOCRATIC RUNOFF, AND THEN THE GENERAL ELECTION.
POD1000000021_S0000288	IN THE DAYS WHEN DEMOCRATS DOMINATED LOUISIANA, THAT LAST RACE, AGAINST A REPUBLICAN ALSO RAN, WAS A POINTLESS NUISANCE.
POD1000000021_S0000289	IT WAS LIKE WINNING THE 100 METER DASH AT THE OLYMPICS, THEN HAVING TO OUT SPRINT A KID PULLED FROM THE STANDS TO GET YOUR GOLD MEDAL.
POD1000000021_S0000290	AND I DIDN'T LIKE THAT IDEA. I SAID, WELL, LOOK, LET'S CHANGE IT.
POD1000000021_S0000291	EVERYBODY QUALIFIES AT THE SAME TIME REGARDLESS OF AFFILIATION.
POD1000000021_S0000292	AND EVERYBODY VOTES FOR ANYBODY HE OR SHE WISHES REGARDLESS OF REGISTRATION.
POD1000000021_S0000293	LOUISIANA'S OPEN PRIMARY SYSTEM WENT INTO EFFECT IN 1975.
POD1000000021_S0000294	EDWARDS CRUISED TO RE ELECTION THAT YEAR, AS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DIDN'T EVEN FIELD A CANDIDATE.
POD1000000021_S0000295	BUT IN THE REAGAN YEARS, THE GOP SURGED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH.
POD1000000021_S0000296	BY 1991, THE OPEN PRIMARY WAS OPEN IN A WAY EDWARDS MAYBE HADN'T ANTICIPATED.
POD1000000021_S0000297	IT WAS A TRUE TWO PARTY FREE FOR ALL.
POD1000000021_S0000298	POLITICAL WRITER JOHN MCGINNIS HAD A NAME FOR THE SHOWDOWN BETWEEN DAVID DUKE, EDWIN EDWARDS, AND BUDDY ROEMER.
POD1000000021_S0000299	I CALL THIS THE RACE FROM HELL.
POD1000000021_S0000300	YOU HAVE THREE VERY ANGRY MEN, CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR, AND THE PEOPLE AREN'T TOO HAPPY EITHER.
POD1000000021_S0000301	IN THE BEGINNING, THE RACE FROM HELL WASN'T EXACTLY ROLLICKING.
POD1000000021_S0000302	ONE REASON FOR THAT WAS A PACKAGE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORMS, PART OF BUDDY ROEMER'S GOOD GOVERNMENT AGENDA.
POD1000000021_S0000303	THE NEW LAW LIMITED INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO $5,000 IN MAJOR STATEWIDE RACES.
POD1000000021_S0000304	BANNED CASH CONTRIBUTIONS OF MORE THAN $100, AND REQUIRED THAT SMALL CASH DONATIONS BE REPORTED.
POD1000000021_S0000305	DUKE COULD PASS THE BUCKET WITH IMPUNITY DURING HIS 1990 SENATE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT WAS A FEDERAL RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000306	BUT THANKS TO ROMER THE REVOLUTIONARY, LOUISIANA'S GUIDELINES ON CASH GIVING WERE NOW STRICTER THAN THE NATION'S.
POD1000000021_S0000307	HAMSTRUNG BY THESE NEW RULES, DUKE HELD FEWER RALLIES AS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR THAN WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE. AND EDWARDS' FUNDRAISING SLOWED TO A TRICKLE.
POD1000000021_S0000308	HE'D RAISED $16 MILLION DURING THE 1983 GOVERNOR'S RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000309	IN THE 1991 PRIMARY, HE BROUGHT IN A LITTLE MORE THAN $1 MILLION.
POD1000000021_S0000310	AND BUDDY ROMER, HE PREFERRED STAYING IN TO GOING OUT TO MEET HIS PUBLIC.
POD1000000021_S0000311	ROMER HAD ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS.
POD1000000021_S0000312	RAYMOND STROTHER SAW IT UP CLOSE DURING THE 1987 RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000313	HE WAS SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS AND READING NOVELS, USUALLY MYSTERY NOVELS, AND HE WOULDN'T GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN.
POD1000000021_S0000314	WE'D GO TO A RESTAURANT TO EAT LUNCH AND HE WOULD SIT IN THE BACK OF THE RESTAURANT IN A CORNER WITH HIS BACK TO THE ROOM.
POD1000000021_S0000315	SO NOBODY WOULD SEE HIM AND RECOGNIZE HIM AND COME OVER AND START TALKING.
POD1000000021_S0000316	ROMER'S CHARISMATIC MISANTHROPE ROUTINE HAD WORKED OUT FINE IN 1987.
POD1000000021_S0000317	AND IT SEEMED POSSIBLE HE COULD PULL OFF THE SAME TRICK IN 1991.
POD1000000021_S0000318	MICHELLE SCHAUER STARTED VOLUNTEERING FOR THE ROMER CAMPAIGN WHEN SHE WAS STILL IN COLLEGE AT LOUISIANA TECH, THEN GOT A JOB ON STAFF RIGHT AFTER GRADUATION.
POD1000000021_S0000319	SHE SAYS THAT WHEN THE GOVERNOR DID MAKE PUBLIC APPEARANCES EARLY ON, HE SEEMED TOTALLY ENERGIZED.
POD1000000021_S0000320	AND HE LITERALLY WALKED INTO THE ROOM, YOU KNOW, PUSHING BOTH DOORS OPEN.
POD1000000021_S0000321	GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. GREAT TO SEE YOU.
POD1000000021_S0000322	YOU KNOW, HE WAS CLAPPING AND SMILING AND REALLY EXUBERANT.
POD1000000021_S0000323	AND IT WAS REALLY VERY EXCITING TO BE IN A ROOM WITH HIM.
POD1000000021_S0000324	HE WAS JUST REALLY ENGAGING THE CROWD.
POD1000000021_S0000325	AND I WOULD SAY FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS. HE REALLY CAME INTO A ROOM AND MADE IT ALIVE.
POD1000000021_S0000326	THE PROBLEM FOR ROMER WAS THAT A LOT OF SWING VOTERS FELT DRAWN TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE.
POD1000000021_S0000327	AT FIRST, STROTHER LIKED THE FOCUS GROUP RESULTS HE WAS HEARING.
POD1000000021_S0000328	BLUE COLLAR DEMOCRATS SAID THEY COULDN'T STAND A HYPOTHETICAL CANDIDATE WITH ALL OF DAVID DUKE'S CHARACTERISTICS.
POD1000000021_S0000329	BUT THEN AS SOON AS THEY LEARNED IT WAS DAVID DUKE, THEY'D SAY, WELL, THAT'S WHAT POLITICIANS DO.
POD1000000021_S0000330	WELL, YOU KNOW, KKK.
POD1000000021_S0000331	WELL, HE WAS A YOUNG MAN. NAZI, WELL, HE WAS A YOUNG GUY.
POD1000000021_S0000332	COLLEGE KIDS DO STUPID STUFF. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT WAS, THEY'D MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR HIM.
POD1000000021_S0000333	WHILE ROMER STRUGGLED TO HOLD HIS COALITION TOGETHER, DUKE WAS FINDING A NEW WAY TO EXPAND HIS APPEAL.
POD1000000021_S0000334	IT'S BEEN TOUGH FOR ME SOMETIMES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, A LOT OF MEDIA ATTACKS, BUT WHAT'S MADE IT BETTER FOR ME IS THAT I'M A CHRISTIAN.
POD1000000021_S0000335	I WORK HARD, I BELIEVE IN CHRIST, AND I'M GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING FOR YOU AND FOR THE FUTURE OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000336	THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
POD1000000021_S0000338	DUKE INVOKED HIS CHRISTIANITY FAR MORE IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE THAN IN ANY OF HIS PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS.
POD1000000021_S0000339	HE USED RELIGION AS BOTH A SHIELD AND A SWORD.
POD1000000021_S0000340	AT A DEBATE IN SEPTEMBER, DUKE SAID THAT HE'D REPENTED FOR HIS PAST SINS AND THAT THOSE WHO TRIED TO DISCREDIT HIM WERE BEING UNCHRISTIAN.
POD1000000021_S0000341	I'VE CERTAINLY BEEN INTOLERANT BEFORE IN MY LIFE.
POD1000000021_S0000342	BUT THOSE WHO WOULD CONDEMN AND POINT THEIR FINGERS AT ME, I'D LIKE THEM TO LOOK IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND ASK IF THEY'D NEVER HURT A FRIEND OR CHANGED THEIR OPINIONS.
POD1000000021_S0000343	IT WASN'T CLEAR, BASED ON POLLING, HOW WHITE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WERE RESPONDING TO DUKE'S LATEST ATTEMPT AT IMAGE MANAGEMENT.
POD1000000021_S0000344	SUSAN HOWELL HAD BEEN STRUGGLING FOR YEARS TO GET A HANDLE ON DUKE'S VOTERS.
POD1000000021_S0000345	HOWELL WAS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS.
POD1000000021_S0000346	SHE'D TAKEN HER FIRST LOOK AT DUKE DURING HIS RUN FOR THE STATEHOUSE, WHEN HIS OPPONENT JOHN TREAN HIRED HER TO DO A PHONE SURVEY.
POD1000000021_S0000347	HOWELL'S POLL IN THE PRIMARY HAD DUKE AT 7%. SHE WAS OFF BY 26 POINTS.
POD1000000021_S0000348	AND I WAS STUNNED. AND THEN JOHN TRINE STOOD UP ON A TABLE AND HE WAS STUNNED TOO.
POD1000000021_S0000349	I REMEMBER HIM SAYING, THE PEOPLE OF METAIRIE ARE NOT RACIST.
POD1000000021_S0000350	AND I THOUGHT, WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD RETHINK THAT.
POD1000000021_S0000351	TRINE FIRED HOWL AFTER THE PRIMARY, SO SHE'D HAVE TO WAIT TO PULL ANOTHER DUKE RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000352	BUT SHE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.
POD1000000021_S0000353	PEOPLE WERE RELUCTANT TO SAY, I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR DUKE BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF BEING LABELED RACIST, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TALKING TO, YOU KNOW, ON AN ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL TO A POLLSTER.
POD1000000021_S0000354	IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO SAY HOW MUCH ALCOHOL THEY DRINK OR WERE THEY EVER ARRESTED.
POD1000000021_S0000355	THIS BECAME A RESEARCH CHALLENGE FOR HOWELL AND HER GRADUATE STUDENTS. HOW COULD THEY GET DAVID DUKE'S SILENT ARMY TO BREAK ITS SILENCE?
POD1000000021_S0000356	WE CAME UP WITH SOME ALTERNATE, I WOULD CALL SNEAKIER, INDIRECT QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE SYMPATHETIC TO DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000357	ONE OF THEM, WHICH ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL IN INCREASING THE DUKE SUPPORT IN THE POLL, WAS TO ASK PEOPLE IF THEY APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OF THE MARTIN LUTHER KING HOLIDAY.
POD1000000021_S0000358	HOWELL CONDUCTED A SURVEY ONE MONTH BEFORE THE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY.
POD1000000021_S0000359	RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED WHO THEY WERE VOTING FOR, AND ALSO HOW THEY FELT ABOUT STATEMENTS LIKE, IF BLACKS WOULD ONLY TRY HARDER, THEY COULD BE JUST AS WELL OFF AS WHITES.
POD1000000021_S0000360	THE RAW NUMBER SHOWED THAT 35% OF PEOPLE WERE VOTING FOR BUDDY ROMER, 30% FOR EDWIN EDWARDS, AND 12% FOR DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000361	BUT WHEN HOWELL ACCOUNTED FOR HER SNEAKIER, INDIRECT QUESTIONS, SUPPORT FOR ROMER AND EDWARDS DIPPED. AND DUKE'S SUPPORT DOUBLED.
POD1000000021_S0000362	GIVEN THE MARGIN OF ERROR, THE ELECTION WAS TOO CLOSE TO CALL.
POD1000000021_S0000364	THAT'S HOW THINGS LOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE. ON THE INSIDE, THERE WAS GOSSIP ABOUT A POSSIBLE SECRET ALLIANCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000365	ROMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT RAYMOND STROTHER HEARD THAT SPECULATION.
POD1000000021_S0000366	THE RUMOR THAT WE HEARD WAS THAT EDWIN EDWARDS WAS ENCOURAGING AND PERHAPS FUNDING DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000368	EDWARDS WANTED REVENGE ON BUDDY ROEMER AFTER LOSING TO HIM IN 1987. BUT EDWARDS ALSO KNEW HOW TO PLAY THE ODDS.
POD1000000021_S0000369	HE WAS SMART ENOUGH, THE THEORY WENT, TO SENSE THAT HE'D HAVE A BETTER SHOT AGAINST AN EX KLANSMAN THAN AGAINST THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR.
POD1000000021_S0000370	NOBODY HAD ANY PROOF WHATSOEVER.
POD1000000021_S0000371	BUT I SELDOM RAN INTO ANYBODY ON EITHER SIDE WHO DIDN'T THINK THAT EDWARDS WAS PLAYING FUNNY WITH DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000373	WHEN I GOT EDWARDS ON THE PHONE...
POD1000000021_S0000374	I ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH TO ALL THAT CHATTER.
POD1000000021_S0000376	DID HE OR HIS SUPPORTERS DO ANYTHING TO HELP DUKE MAKE THE RUNOFF?
POD1000000021_S0000377	LIKE EITHER GIVING HIM MONEY OR OR PROPPING HIM UP IN SOME WAY
POD1000000021_S0000378	DID YOU OR YOUR SUPPORTERS DO ANYTHING TO HELP DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF WITH YOU?
POD1000000021_S0000379	NO, I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY. AND I WOULD HAVE MAYBE GOT CAUGHT AT IT. SO I DIDN'T DO THAT.
POD1000000021_S0000380	I JUST LET HIM RUN HIS RACE. I RAN MINE. ROMA RAN HIS.
POD1000000021_S0000382	AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I GOT CHASING DOWN THAT RUMOR.
POD1000000021_S0000383	BUT I DID LEARN SOMETHING ELSE.
POD1000000021_S0000384	THE EDWARDS CAMPAIGN, IT TURNS OUT, HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SECRET ALLIANCE.
POD1000000021_S0000386	CLYDE HOLLOWAY WAS THE PRO LIFE CONGRESSMAN WHO'D GOTTEN THE OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT OF THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY.
POD1000000021_S0000387	INSTEAD OF DUKE OR ROMER. HE WAS WAY BACK IN THE POLLS, IN A DISTANT FOURTH, AND NEEDED CASH TO AIR COMMERCIALS.
POD1000000021_S0000388	ONE OF EDWIN EDWARDS' CLOSEST FRIENDS.
POD1000000021_S0000390	NEW ONE OF HOLLOWAY'S CAMPAIGN ADVISORS.
POD1000000021_S0000391	TO HIM, OF COURSE, AS THE TWO OF THEM HATCHED A PLAN.
POD1000000021_S0000392	HE WOULD SHOW ME RESULTS OF A TRACKING POLL, WHICH OUR PEOPLE CONFIRMED THAT EVERY VOTE
POD1000000021_S0000393	THAT HOLLOWAY WAS RECEIVING OR GETTING WAS COMING DIRECTLY OFF OF THE SITTING GOVERNOR, BUDDY ROMO.
POD1000000021_S0000394	AND WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE MAXED OUT OR HAVE A LOT OF MONEY THAT SUPPORTED
POD1000000021_S0000395	THAT WAS ASKING WHAT ELSE THEY COULD DO. SO WE'D GET THESE COMMERCIALS ON TV AND RADIO.
POD1000000021_S0000396	I SAID THAT WOULD HELP US POSSIBLY GETTING IN THE SECOND PRIMARY WITH DAVID DUKE RATHER THAN US SITTING IN BELVIDERE.
POD1000000021_S0000397	TAHEMAHKORD IS DESCRIBING AN ELECTORAL DOUBLE BANK SHOT.
POD1000000021_S0000398	EDWARD SUPPORTERS SEND MONEY TO HOLLOWAY.
POD1000000021_S0000399	HOLLOWAY TAKES VOTES FROM ROMER.
POD1000000021_S0000400	ROMER SLIDES OUT OF THE RUNOFF, AND DUKE SLIDES IN.
POD1000000021_S0000401	WE FELT THAT WE COULD BEAT DAVID DUKE SUBSTANTIALLY AND MARTY ROMO WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT RESULT.
POD1000000021_S0000403	PULLING AT THE TOP SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TIGHT.
POD1000000021_S0000404	DID GOVERNOR EDWARDS KNOW ABOUT THIS STRATEGY?
POD1000000021_S0000405	YES, I INFORMED HIM THAT IT WAS GOING ON AND HIS ANSWER WAS BE CAREFUL.
POD1000000021_S0000407	WHEN I ASKED EDWARDS ABOUT THE ALLIANCE, HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
POD1000000021_S0000408	IN JOHN MCGINNIS' BOOK ABOUT THE 1991 CAMPAIGN, CLYDE HOLLOWAY'S CAMPAIGN ADVISOR, BRIAN WAGNER, ALSO DENIED MAKING ANY SUCH DEAL.
POD1000000021_S0000409	WAGNER DIED IN 2018.
POD1000000021_S0000410	THAT SAID, I BELIEVE DAHEMACORD'S STORY.
POD1000000021_S0000411	TO BE CLEAR, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL, ASSUMING THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS GOT REPORTED.
POD1000000021_S0000412	BUT IT WAS KIND OF DEVIOUS, A WAY TO HELP DAVID DUKE WITHOUT GIVING HIM DIRECT SUPPORT.
POD1000000021_S0000413	I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS ALLIANCE SEEM MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WAS.
POD1000000021_S0000414	THOSE HOLLOWAY ADS WERE JUST A SMALL DROP IN AN ENORMOUS BUCKET OF CAMPAIGN SPENDING.
POD1000000021_S0000415	IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE RACE, THE OWNER OF A HAZARDOUS WASTE RECYCLING COMPANY SPENT A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON ANTI ROMER COMMERCIALS BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.
POD1000000021_S0000416	THAT ADD BY WAS A HUGE DEAL.
POD1000000021_S0000417	THE HOLLOWAY ADS REALLY WEREN'T.
POD1000000021_S0000418	BUT IT'S STILL TELLING THAT THE EDWARDS CAMPAIGN WAS WILLING TO TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES TO HELP DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF.
POD1000000021_S0000419	I THINK IT IS VERY TYPICAL OF EDWIN EDWARDS.
POD1000000021_S0000420	THAT'S QUINN HILLIER. HE WAS ONE OF LOUISIANA'S MOST PROMINENT ANTI DUKE REPUBLICANS.
POD1000000021_S0000421	HE ALSO THINKS EDWARDS IS TOTALLY CORRUPT.
POD1000000021_S0000422	HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE EDWARDS HOLLOWAY ALLIANCE.
POD1000000021_S0000423	I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IMMORAL, IT'S JUST AMORAL, COMPLETELY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MORALITY OF TRYING TO HELP DAVID DUKE GET INTO THE RUNOFF AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000424	IT CERTAINLY WAS PLAYING EVERY POLITICAL ANGLE AND IT WAS EDWIN EDWARDS AND HIS PEOPLE AT THEIR EDWIN EDWARDS EST.
POD1000000021_S0000426	THIS WAS, IN SOME WAYS, TYPICAL LOUISIANA CHICANERY.
POD1000000021_S0000427	POLITICS IS SPORT WITH A WIN AT ALL COST MENTALITY.
POD1000000021_S0000428	BUT DUKE WASN'T A TYPICAL CANDIDATE.
POD1000000021_S0000429	MAYBE THE EDWARDS CAMP WAS RIGHT THAT THEIR ODDS WERE BETTER AGAINST DUKE THAN ROMER.
POD1000000021_S0000430	BUT WHAT IF THEY WERE WRONG? WHAT IF DAVID DUKE WON?
POD1000000021_S0000432	WE'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.
POD1000000021_S0000434	I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER PODCAST I THINK YOU'LL LOVE. DEEP COVER, THE DRUG WARS.
POD1000000021_S0000435	IS A TRUE STORY THAT BEGINS WITH A DETROIT FBI AGENT GOING UNDERCOVER IN AN OUTLAW MOTORCYCLE GANG.
POD1000000021_S0000436	AND ENDS WITH THE U.S. INVASION OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
POD1000000021_S0000437	PULITZER PRIZE WINNING JOURNALIST JAKE HALPERN GUIDES LISTENERS ON THIS WILD JOURNEY OF MARIJUANA, MOTORCYCLES, AND MAYHEM.
POD1000000021_S0000438	IT'S PERFECT FOR FANS OF NARCOS, SONS OF ANARCHY, OR ANYTHING BY THE COEN BROTHERS.
POD1000000021_S0000439	YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW ON APPLE PODCASTS OR WHEREVER YOU LISTEN. BROUGHT TO YOU BY PUSHKIN INDUSTRIES.
POD1000000021_S0000441	IN JANUARY 1989, DAVID DUKE HAD BEEN A BIT PLAYER, A SECOND TIER CANDIDATE IN A SMALL SUBURBAN RACE.
POD1000000021_S0000442	NOW, ALMOST THREE YEARS LATER, HE WAS A STAR AND A CONTENDER.
POD1000000021_S0000443	HIS ELECTION NIGHT PARTY WAS A CELEBRATION OF HOW FAR HE'D COME AND HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO WINNING THE STATE'S BIGGEST PRIZE.
POD1000000021_S0000444	OH, YOU WANNA LOOK? I GOT DUKE'S STICKERS OVER MY SHIRT.
POD1000000021_S0000445	NO BIG DEAL. I'D HAVE DOUCHE TAKERS ON MY FACE IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO SEE.
POD1000000021_S0000446	ON OCTOBER 19, 1991, DUKE'S FANS GATHERED AT THE PONTCHARTRAIN CENTER IN HIS HOME TERRITORY OF JEFFERSON PARISH.
POD1000000021_S0000447	THEY WERE TREATED TO A SHORT PERFORMANCE BY THAT BLONDE WOMAN IN THE BLUE DRESS WHO SANG AT LOTS OF DUKE RALLIES.
POD1000000021_S0000449	AFTER DIXIE CAME A PRAYER.
POD1000000021_S0000450	WE ASK THAT YOU GUIDE OUR LEADERS AND THAT THEY MIGHT GOVERN WITH COMPASSION AND LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING.
POD1000000021_S0000451	WE ASK A SPECIAL BLESSING UPON THIS ASSEMBLY.
POD1000000021_S0000452	AND THAT WHICH IS DONE HERE WILL BE ULTIMATELY TO THE GLORY OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
POD1000000021_S0000453	AND THEN DAVID DUKE HIMSELF TOOK THE STAGE.
POD1000000021_S0000454	WITH EVERY MINUTE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT APPEARS THAT WE WILL BE IN A RUNOFF FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000456	BACK IN 1989, AT DUKE'S FIRST VICTORY PARTY, HE'D SHOUTED ABOUT WINNING A STATE HOUSE SEAT WITHOUT ANY BIG POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS.
POD1000000021_S0000457	HE'D ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, AND WHINED THAT HE WAS ALWAYS GETTING LIED ABOUT.
POD1000000021_S0000458	IN 1991, HE DIDN'T SOUND BITTER OR VENGEFUL.
POD1000000021_S0000459	THIS DAVID DUKE WAS SMOOTH, HUMBLE, CONCILIATORY.
POD1000000021_S0000460	HE'D FIGURED OUT HOW HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SOUND AND HOW TO MAKE AN APPEAL THAT WASN'T ENTIRELY BASED ON GRIEVANCE.
POD1000000021_S0000461	MY THANKS GOES FIRST TO THE FORCE OF MY LIFE THAT'S GIVEN ME STRENGTH AND HELPED ME
POD1000000021_S0000463	WE STAND A LOT AND CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR YOU.
POD1000000021_S0000464	AND THAT'S JESUS CHRIST LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
POD1000000021_S0000467	DAVID DUKE WAS IN THE RUNOFF WITH 32% OF THE VOTE.
POD1000000021_S0000468	DUKE FINISHED JUST TWO POINTS BEHIND THE LEADER.
POD1000000021_S0000469	EDWIN EDWARDS. BUDDY ROMER'S POLITICAL CONSULTANT, RAYMOND STROTHER, KNEW HIS MAN WAS GOING TO COME IN THIRD.
POD1000000021_S0000470	HE WENT TO BED AT THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION BEFORE THE RACE GOT CALLED.
POD1000000021_S0000471	AND THE NEXT MORNING I GOT UP AND I WENT DOWN TO GET MY COOKIES AND MILK.
POD1000000021_S0000472	AND BUDDY WAS DOWN THERE AND HE SAID, WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD CANDIDATE, DID YOU?
POD1000000021_S0000473	I SAID, MUST NOT HAVE, BUDDY.
POD1000000021_S0000474	HE SAID, WELL, WE TOOK OUR BEST SHOT AND HE WALKED OUT AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO HIM.
POD1000000021_S0000475	BUDDY ROMER FINISHED FIVE POINTS BEHIND DAVID DUKE.
POD1000000021_S0000476	ULTIMATELY, HE WASN'T TAKEN DOWN BY AN ELECTORAL CONSPIRACY.
POD1000000021_S0000477	HE'D LOST BECAUSE LOUISIANA DIDN'T WANT A REFORMER.
POD1000000021_S0000478	AND TONIGHT THE PEOPLE SPOKE AND THEY SAID, BUDDY, THANKS, BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ENOUGH. AND I THINK THAT'S FAIR.
POD1000000021_S0000479	WHEN MICHELLE SCHAUER STARTED WORKING ON THE CAMPAIGN, SHE'D BEEN INSPIRED BY BUDDY ROEMER'S ENERGY.
POD1000000021_S0000480	BUT NOW THAT IT WAS OVER, SCHAUER THOUGHT ROMER ACTUALLY SEEMED RELIEVED.
POD1000000021_S0000481	SHE FOUND HER OWN FEELINGS HARDER TO PIN DOWN.
POD1000000021_S0000482	SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT LEAVING THE STATE, MAYBE GOING TO LIVE WITH HER PARENTS IN MONTANA.
POD1000000021_S0000483	BUT THEN, SHE GOT APPROACHED BY SOME PEOPLE SHE KNEW FROM THE LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY.
POD1000000021_S0000484	THEY SAID, WE HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU BEFORE YOU REJECT IT OUTRIGHT.
POD1000000021_S0000485	JUST LISTEN TO US AND THEY SAID YOU COULD GO TO WORK ON DAVID DUKE'S CAMPAIGN
POD1000000021_S0000486	AND OF COURSE MY EYES WIDEN LIKE, ARE YOU CRAZY?
POD1000000021_S0000487	SCHAUER HAD NEVER CONSIDERED SUPPORTING DAVID DUKE, MUCH LESS WORKING FOR HIM.
POD1000000021_S0000488	HER FAMILY HAD BEEN ON GOVERNMENT AID WHEN SHE WAS GROWING UP, SO HIS RANTS AGAINST WELFARE WEREN'T PERSUASIVE.
POD1000000021_S0000489	BUT SCHAUER REALLY DIDN'T WANT EDWIN EDWARDS BACK IN CHARGE OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000490	PLUS, THOSE PEOPLE FROM THE STATE PARTY TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T NEED TO TAKE A PUBLIC FACING ROLE.
POD1000000021_S0000491	THAT SHE COULD STAY IN THE SHADOWS.
POD1000000021_S0000492	SCHAUER AGREED TO MEET WITH DUKE'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HOWIE FARRELL.
POD1000000021_S0000493	WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER, HE SAID THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO BROADEN THE DUKE OPERATION BY BRINGING IN PEOPLE FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT.
POD1000000021_S0000494	SCHAUER WANTED TO BE A CAMPAIGN MANAGER SOMEDAY.
POD1000000021_S0000495	AND SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF LEARNING FROM ONE. SHE WAS ALSO UNEMPLOYED.
POD1000000021_S0000496	SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I HAD A JOB AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT AN ALTERNATE CAMPAIGN. AND THAT'S HOW I STARTED.
POD1000000021_S0000498	DURING HER STINT AS A DUKE STAFFER, MICHELLE SHOWER WOULD HEAR THINGS THAT SHOCKED HER.
POD1000000021_S0000499	SHE'D ALSO MAKE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS ON BEHALF OF DAVID DUKE, USING A LIST SHE'D BROUGHT WITH HER FROM THE ROMER CAMPAIGN.
POD1000000021_S0000500	THAT LIST WAS THE MAIN REASON THE DUKE CAMPAIGN HAD HIRED SCHAUER.
POD1000000021_S0000501	ROMER'S SUPPORTERS WERE NOW UP FOR GRABS. IF THEY VOTED REPUBLICAN IN THE NOVEMBER RUNOFF,
POD1000000021_S0000502	THEN DAVID DUKE WAS GOING TO BE THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000503	THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS STILL NOT GOING TO SUPPORT DUKE PUBLICLY. BUT HE WAS THE LAST REPUBLICAN STANDING.
POD1000000021_S0000504	AND WHEN SCHAUER TALKED TO HER FRIENDS IN THE PARTY, THEY SAID THEY KNEW HOW TO KEEP DUKE UNDER CONTROL.
POD1000000021_S0000505	WHEN I WOULD HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS, THEY WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT MUCH HE CAN DO.
POD1000000021_S0000506	HE'S GONNA HAVE SO MANY EYES ON HIM IF HE WINS.
POD1000000021_S0000507	THERE'S SO MANY EYES. WE'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM.
POD1000000021_S0000508	HE WON'T BE ABLE TO PUSH FORWARD ANY OF THESE AGENDAS FROM HIS PAST.
POD1000000021_S0000509	HE'LL HAVE TO STICK TO THE POLICIES.
POD1000000021_S0000510	AND AT THAT TIME, I BELIEVED THEM.
POD1000000021_S0000511	AND AT THAT TIME, I THOUGHT, WHILE I WASN'T REALLY WILLING TO SAY I WAS FOR HIM, I WAS MORE FOR SWEEPING IN A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO TRY TO FIX THINGS IN LOUISIANA.
POD1000000021_S0000512	THAT'S REALLY WHERE I WAS COMING FROM AT THAT TIME.
POD1000000021_S0000514	NEXT TIME, ON THE FINAL EPISODE OF OUR SEASON, FOUR WEEKS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF LOUISIANA. WHAT WOULD DAVID DUKE DO TO WIN?

POD1000000021_S0000531	THANKS FOR LISTENING.
POD1000000023_S0000000	HELLO EVERYONE. I'M STEPHEN WEST. THIS IS PHILOSOPHIZE THIS. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE SHOW ON PATREON AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THOSE OF YOU THAT UPPED YOUR PLEDGE DURING THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES.
POD1000000023_S0000001	I'M BEYOND GRATEFUL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE UP ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME. TODAY'S EPISODE IS ON THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF RICHARD RORTY. I HOPE YOU LOVE THE SHOW TODAY.
POD1000000023_S0000003	SO IF YOU'RE HAVING A POLITICAL DISCUSSION WITH SOMEONE, AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A TURN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000004	THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES YOU COULD APPROACH THAT DISCUSSION FROM, BUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ONES MIGHT BE, WHAT PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING CAN WE GIVE TO SOMETHING LIKE HUMAN RIGHTS?
POD1000000023_S0000005	I MEAN, WE ALL THINK HUMAN BEINGS HAVE RIGHTS. BUT WHERE EXACTLY DO THOSE RIGHTS COME FROM? WHO OR WHAT OUT THERE GUARANTEES THESE RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE?
POD1000000023_S0000006	WELL, A COMMON ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MIGHT BE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE INHERITED BY BIRTHRIGHT. SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF BEING BORN, EVERY HUMAN BEING IS ENTITLED TO CERTAIN NATURAL RIGHTS OR INALIENABLE RIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000007	RIGHTS THAT PROTECT THE DIGNITY OF A HUMAN LIFE AT SUCH A BASIC LEVEL THAT TO GO AGAINST THEM STARTS TO SEEM LIKE YOU'D BE GOING AGAINST NATURE.
POD1000000023_S0000008	NOW AS FAR AS THE PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING IS CONCERNED, THIS IS AN ATTITUDE MUCH MORE COMMON DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT THAN IT IS TODAY.
POD1000000023_S0000009	AND THE TWO MAIN THINKERS THAT TOOK ON THIS POSITION ARE OFTEN CITED TO BE JOHN LOCKE AND IMMANUEL KANT.
POD1000000023_S0000010	WHEN IT COMES TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHO OR WHAT GUARANTEES THESE HUMAN RIGHTS, JOHN LOCKE GOES IN THE DIRECTION OF GOD. YOU KNOW, WE ARE ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000011	AND KANT GOES MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF A PRIORI FACTS DERIVED FROM REASON. BUT EITHER WAY, THESE THINKERS ARE IN THEIR OWN WAY TRYING TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT A UNIVERSAL THAT GUARANTEES HUMAN BEINGS ARE BORN WITH NATURAL RIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000012	LITTLE DID EITHER OF THESE THINKERS KNOW THAT JUST 140 YEARS LATER, WE'D BE IMMERSED IN TWO WORLD WARS THAT WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT FOR THE NATURAL RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS SEEM ABOUT AS IMPORTANT AS NECK RUFFLES WERE TO THEM.
POD1000000023_S0000013	SEE, AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS SHOW, THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY WAS FULL OF THINKERS DISSATISFIED WITH WHAT THE ENLIGHTENMENT HAD PRODUCED. THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE ENTIRE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS DESTINED TO CONSUME ITSELF FROM THE START.
POD1000000023_S0000014	YEAH, SURE, AT THE BEGINNING REASON CALLS INTO QUESTION MUCH OF THE RELIGIOUS DOGMA OF THE MIDDLE AGES. BUT WHAT INEVITABLY HAS TO HAPPEN ONCE IT GETS DONE WITH THAT JOB IS REASON HAS TO START QUESTIONING THE NEW FOUNDATIONS FOR THINGS.
POD1000000023_S0000015	REASON HAS TO START QUESTIONING ITSELF. WHICH THEN LEADS TO PHILOSOPHERS USING THE PROCESS OF RATIONALITY TO FIND OUT THAT RATIONALITY IS NOT SOME UNBIASED, AHISTORICAL MEASURING TOOL.
POD1000000023_S0000016	IT'S NOT SOME NEUTRAL POINT FROM WHICH WE CAN MAKE UNAMBIGUOUS CLAIMS ABOUT THE TRUTH OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR, MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE UNIVERSE. TO THE THINKER WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY, RICHARD RORTY.
POD1000000023_S0000017	PEOPLE LIKE LOCKE AND KANT WERE NO MORE DISCOVERING A TRUTH ABOUT WHAT GROUNDS HUMAN RIGHTS THAN HAMMURABI WAS BEFORE THEM.
POD1000000023_S0000018	BUT UNLIKE MANY OF THE THINKERS OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, WHO MAY HAVE FELT A BIT DISENFRANCHISED BY THE RATIONAL PROCESS, RICHARD RORTY FELT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RATIONALITY.
POD1000000023_S0000019	SOME PEOPLE CALLED RORTY A POSTMODERNIST, WHICH WOULD USUALLY PLACE HIM IN STAUNCH OPPOSITION TO ANYTHING THAT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE THE WORD ENLIGHTENMENT.
POD1000000023_S0000020	LIKE EXCITEMENT. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, RORTY WAS A VERY EXCITING MAN. HE REJECTED THE TITLE OF POSTMODERNIST, AND MOST TITLES FOR THAT MATTER.
POD1000000023_S0000021	HE OPERATED IN A VERY UNIQUE REALM FOR A THINKER WHERE, LIKE A TYPICAL POST STRUCTURALIST, HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ANY SORT OF GRAND NARRATIVE THAT COULD EXPLAIN AWAY THE UNIVERSE.
POD1000000023_S0000022	BUT YET HE WAS STILL A DIE HARD, CARD CARRYING FAN OF THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT OVERALL.
POD1000000023_S0000023	SEE, IN A WORLD WHERE THERE'S SO MANY 20TH CENTURY THINKERS HATING ON THE ENLIGHTENMENT, HERE'S A GUY SOME PEOPLE VIEWED AS A POST STRUCTURALIST COMING TO ITS DEFENSE.
POD1000000023_S0000024	LET ME EXPLAIN WHY HE'D EVEN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
POD1000000023_S0000025	WHEN IMMANUEL KANT, IN HIS FAMOUS ESSAY, DESCRIBES THE ENLIGHTENMENT AS MAN'S REMOVAL OF HIS SELF INCURRED TUTELAGE. YEAH, HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE TUTELAGE OF THE RELIGIOUS DOGMA OF THE PAST.
POD1000000023_S0000026	BUT RORTY WOULD EXTEND THAT TUTELAGE TO THE RATIONAL DOGMA THAT WAS TO COME IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF HOW OVERAMBITIOUS WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ABOUT WHAT RATIONALITY COULD PRODUCE.
POD1000000023_S0000027	THE SPIRIT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT TO RORTY WAS NOT TO USE REASON TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.
POD1000000023_S0000028	IT WAS ULTIMATELY A CALL TO SUBVERT TRADITIONAL FORMS OF AUTHORITY. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS NOT TO LAND ON NEW ANSWERS,
POD1000000023_S0000029	IT WAS TO QUESTION OLD ASSUMPTIONS. SO IN THAT SENSE, YEAH, THE INITIAL PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ULTIMATELY CONSUMED ITSELF.
POD1000000023_S0000030	BUT TO RICHARD BRODY, THE INITIAL PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS MEANT TO CONSUME ITSELF. THINKERS LIKE ISAIAH BERLIN THAT WOULD COME ALONG AND SUGGEST A PLURALISTIC VISION OF THINGS.
POD1000000023_S0000031	THIS WASN'T AN ANTI ENLIGHTENMENT IDEA AT ALL. TO RORTY, THIS WAS THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT LEFT TO PLAY ITSELF OUT.
POD1000000023_S0000032	THINKERS LIKE BERLIN WERE ALWAYS GOING TO EVENTUALLY COME ALONG.
POD1000000023_S0000033	SEE, THE PROJECT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT MATURING THROUGH PEOPLE LIKE ISAIAH BERLIN TAUGHT US A COUPLE OF EXTREMELY VALUABLE INSIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000034	ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO TRY TO USE REASON TO APPEAL TO SOME ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OR UNIVERSAL TO GROUND OUR IDEAS.
POD1000000023_S0000035	RATIONALITY IS NOT A TOOL THAT GETS US TO OBJECTIVITY ABOUT THINGS.
POD1000000023_S0000036	BUT IT MAY GET US A VERY EFFECTIVE MIX OF INTERSUBJECTIVITY BETWEEN CULTURES.
POD1000000023_S0000037	WORDY WANTS TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF LOOKING AT THE LEGACY OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT.
POD1000000023_S0000038	MAYBE IT IS POINTLESS TO TRY TO DO OUR BEST IMPRESSIONS OF LOCKE AND KANT AND TO TRY TO ACCESS THE UNIVERSE THROUGH REASON.
POD1000000023_S0000039	BUT WHEN IT COMES TO STRICTLY HUMAN INSTITUTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE POLITICAL REALM, WHERE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ACCESS THINGS IN THEMSELVES,
POD1000000023_S0000040	WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER THE BEST. MAYBE THAT IS WHERE RATIONALITY THRIVES AS A METHOD.
POD1000000023_S0000041	WHAT ALL THIS IS ALLUDING TO IS THE FACT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT THE ONLY THINGS PHILOSOPHERS HAVE TRIED TO GROUND IN UNIVERSALS IN THE PAST.
POD1000000023_S0000042	THE VERY STRUCTURE OF SOME POLITICAL SYSTEMS, LIBERALISM FOR EXAMPLE, HAS ALSO HISTORICALLY BEEN GROUNDED IN UNIVERSALS.
POD1000000023_S0000043	ONCE AGAIN, I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT GET ANGRY VERY QUICKLY.
POD1000000023_S0000044	AND THEY ALSO MUST BE PART OF SOME SORT OF EMAIL CLUB THAT'S OUT THERE.
POD1000000023_S0000045	WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIBERALISM AS A FOUNDATION FOR SOCIETY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT WITH A FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, CONSENT TO THE GOVERNED, AN AVERSION TO ANY SORT OF COLLECTIVIST SYSTEM, OR SYSTEMS THAT WERE POPULAR AT OTHER POINTS IN HISTORY, MAYBE A CASTE SYSTEM, FOR EXAMPLE.
POD1000000023_S0000046	NOW, YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A PHILOSOPHER AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A CASE FOR LIBERALISM BEING BETTER THAN A CASTE SYSTEM.
POD1000000023_S0000047	IT MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO START TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT HUMAN BEINGS AT THE LEVEL OF THE UNIVERSE ARE ALL EQUAL, AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE RELEGATED TO DIFFERENT RANKS WITHIN A SOCIETY.
POD1000000023_S0000048	BUT TO RORTY, THIS WOULD BE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE THAT LOCKE AND KANT MADE IN OUR EXAMPLE FROM BEFORE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS.
POD1000000023_S0000049	THE FACT IS TO RORTY, WE DON'T NEED THAT SORT OF ULTIMATE FOUNDATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CASE FOR THE FACT THAT LIBERALISM IS HOW WE SHOULD BE RUNNING THINGS.
POD1000000023_S0000050	FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS. ONE, LIKE WE ALREADY SAID, WE CAN'T ACTUALLY ACCESS THE UNIVERSE AT THAT LEVEL THROUGH RATIONALITY.
POD1000000023_S0000051	TWO, SOCIETY IS JUST FAR BETTER OFF WHEN IT CAN BASE PUBLIC POLICY ON THE RATIONAL CONSENSUS OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS, RATHER THAN A PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY ARRIVED AT BY SOME GUY IN A TOWER THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO RELATE TO.
POD1000000023_S0000052	THINK OF THE LIMITATIONS YOU INSTANTLY PLACE ON YOURSELF IF YOU DECIDE THAT EVERY PUBLIC POLICY OR VALUE OF A SOCIETY NEEDS TO BE GROUNDED IN SOME PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION THAT TELLS YOU HOW HUMAN BEINGS ARE AT LARGE.
POD1000000023_S0000053	FIRST OF ALL, LET'S SAY YOU DECIDE TO STRUCTURE YOUR SOCIETY AROUND THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO.
POD1000000023_S0000054	YOU'RE SOON GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ON A CONSTANT PR CAMPAIGN TRYING TO CONTINUOUSLY SELL THESE IDEAS TO A POPULATION JUST CROSSING YOUR FINGERS THAT THEY GO ALONG WITH IT.
POD1000000023_S0000055	SECOND OF ALL, ALMOST ALWAYS, THESE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT STRUCTURE YOUR SOCIETY AROUND WERE CREATED IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CULTURE THAT EMERGED OUT OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT HISTORY.
POD1000000023_S0000056	WHICH MEANS THESE THEORIES CAN BRING A LOT OF BAGGAGE ALONG WITH THEM THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT IN THE PRESENT CULTURE.
POD1000000023_S0000057	THIRDLY, YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE FIGHTING A SORT OF LOSING BATTLE TO RORTY, BECAUSE HE WILL ALWAYS BE TRYING TO CRAM ONE INTERPRETATION OF HOW HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE STRUCTURED INTO THE ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX PLURALISTIC MAELSTROM OF PEOPLE COEXISTING TOGETHER.
POD1000000023_S0000058	RORTY IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING, MAYBE WE DON'T NEED THE PHILOSOPHER UP IN THE TOWER THINKING ALL DAY, TELLING US HOW TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETIES, BECAUSE, WELL, I'VE DECIDED IT SHORES UP WITH HOW THE UNIVERSE IS.
POD1000000023_S0000059	MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE WAY THE UNIVERSE IS, BUT MAYBE THAT DOESN'T MATTER. MAYBE WE DON'T NEED SOME ELABORATE PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETY FOR US. MAYBE A STRATEGY IS LEGITIMATE.
POD1000000023_S0000060	LIBERALISM, FOR INSTANCE. IF THE CITIZENS OF A PARTICULAR CULTURE, POSITIONED IN HISTORY AT A PARTICULAR TIME AND PLACE, ALL THE CITIZENS FACING A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF COMMON PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEED TO SOLVE.
POD1000000023_S0000061	MAYBE A STRATEGY IS LEGITIMATE IF THE PEOPLE OF THAT SOCIETY DECIDE THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN IT. BECAUSE ONE THING'S FOR SURE, ONE ULTIMATE THEORY IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
POD1000000023_S0000062	RORTY, WHO WAS A HUGE FAN OF ISAIAH BERLIN, SOMETIMES TALKS IN HIS WORK ABOUT THE QUOTE, FACT OF PLURALISM.
POD1000000023_S0000063	THIS IS WHAT A SOCIETY IS, TABORDI. WE ARE WORSE OFF AS A SOCIETY IF WE TRY TO USE A SINGLE RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY TO JUSTIFY OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY.
POD1000000023_S0000064	YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE. PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS ARRIVE AT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS.
POD1000000023_S0000065	SO, INSTEAD OF EMBARKING ON A NEVER ENDING SALES CAMPAIGN FOR AN IDEA, WORDY SUGGESTS THAT WE ALLOW OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY TO REFLECT THE COMMON VALUES OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE UP THE CULTURE.
POD1000000023_S0000066	HE WRITES ABOUT HOW IF WE DO THIS, AND WE'RE CAREFUL, EVENTUALLY, IF YOU WERE HAVING THAT SAME CONVERSATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE, AND YOU ASK SOMEBODY, WHAT GROUNDS HUMAN RIGHTS?
POD1000000023_S0000067	THE COMMON TENDENCY WON'T BE TO TRY TO APPEAL TO SOMETHING WRITTEN INTO THE UNIVERSE, OR TO CITE SOME RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION YOU READ IN A BOOK SOMEWHERE.
POD1000000023_S0000068	THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE FOR PEOPLE TO SEE SOCIAL POLICY AS LEGITIMATE IF IT WAS APPROVED BY THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVING IN THE CULTURE.
POD1000000023_S0000069	WHEN ASKED THE QUESTION, WHAT GROUNDS THIS PIECE OF SOCIAL POLICY? THE ANSWER WON'T INVOLVE POINTING TO SOME PHILOSOPHER FROM 300 YEARS AGO.
POD1000000023_S0000070	YOU KNOW, DESCARTES' FAMOUS WORK, A TREATISE CONCERNING WHY DRUGS SHOULD BE LEGALIZED, AND WHY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE ON AN AIRPLANE. NO. NO.
POD1000000023_S0000071	THE AUTHORITY LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE SET OF PEOPLE POSITIONED IN HISTORY WITH A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT.
POD1000000023_S0000072	AND ONCE AGAIN, TORORTI, NOT ONLY DO WE NOT NEED ANY MORE AUTHORITY THAN THAT, WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY AUTHORITY OTHER THAN THAT, AND WE'RE BETTER OFF THIS WAY ANYWAY.
POD1000000023_S0000073	SHOULD BE SAID, THIS IS YET ANOTHER WAY WE CAN ACCESS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW WE CAN FIND A BRIDGE BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE.
POD1000000023_S0000074	RORTY OBVIOUSLY IS NOT APPEALING TO A SINGLE THEORY, BUT HE ALSO IS NOT APPEALING TO PURE RELATIVISM OR HISTORICISM.
POD1000000023_S0000075	HIS ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN JUSTIFY OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY PLACE HIM IN WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST ACCURATE CATEGORY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF HIS BIGGEST IDEAS.
POD1000000023_S0000076	RORTY IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS A PRAGMATIST. AND I THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND RORTY'S OVERALL POSITION A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF WE TAKE A SECOND TO TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH.
POD1000000023_S0000077	MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS PEOPLE HAVE VIEWED THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH AND THE WAY A PRAGMATIST LIKE RORTY WOULD HAVE VIEWED THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH.
POD1000000023_S0000078	SO LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THEORIES OF WHAT CONSTITUTES TRUTH FROM THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY. ONE THAT RICHARD RORTY THOUGHT HAS BEEN DOMINANT SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT.
POD1000000023_S0000079	WHAT HE SOMETIMES CALLS THE REPRESENTATIONALIST PARADIGM, SOMETIMES CALLED BY OTHERS THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY OF TRUTH. BUT LET ME TAKE A SECOND TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
POD1000000023_S0000080	THE MOST BASIC IDEA IS, SUPPOSE SOMEBODY SAYS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE WAY THINGS ARE IN THE WORLD. HOW DO WE TELL IF THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE?
POD1000000023_S0000081	WELL, THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE IF IT REPRESENTS THE WAY THINGS REALLY ARE IN THE WORLD. IF THERE'S A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE DESCRIPTION AND REALITY, THEN WE CAN SAY IT'S TRUE.
POD1000000023_S0000082	NOW, THERE'S OF COURSE MOUNTAINS OF DETAIL THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT HERE, BUT RICHARD BRODY DISAGREES WITH THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY, EVEN AT THIS BASIC RUDIMENTARY LEVEL.
POD1000000023_S0000083	WHENEVER YOU TRY TO CREATE A BRIDGE BETWEEN A DESCRIPTION YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD AND THE REALITY OF THE WORLD THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT, THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN EVER DESCRIBE ANYTHING IS THROUGH LANGUAGE.
POD1000000023_S0000084	LANGUAGE MEDIATES OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY. YOU CAN'T ACCESS REALITY WITHOUT LANGUAGE. BUT TO RORTY IT EVEN GOES ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THIS.
POD1000000023_S0000085	NOT ONLY IS LANGUAGE A MEDIUM BETWEEN US AND REALITY, BUT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES REALITY.
POD1000000023_S0000086	MEANING THAT THE LANGUAGE WE USE AND THE WAY WE USE IT CHANGES THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT REALITY.
POD1000000023_S0000087	THIS COULD BE AN ENTIRE SERIES ON ITS OWN, BUT THE POINT IS THAT CERTAIN LANGUAGES AND THE CULTURES THAT USE THEM FAVOR CERTAIN HABITS OF INTERPRETING EVENTS.
POD1000000023_S0000088	THESE INTERPRETATIONS GREATLY DETERMINE THE ENTIRE WAY WE SEE REALITY AND THE WAY HUMAN BEINGS PERCEIVE REALITY VARIES GREATLY FROM CULTURE TO CULTURE, LANGUAGE TO LANGUAGE.
POD1000000023_S0000089	SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF CORRESPONDENCE OR REPRESENTATION GOING ON, THAT THE WORLD OUT THERE IS SOMEHOW HELPING US VERIFY WHETHER STATEMENTS ARE TRUE OR FALSE,
POD1000000023_S0000090	THAT'S JUST WRONG, BECAUSE RORTY THINKS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO EVER STEP OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF LANGUAGE AND ACCESS THE WORLD OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES, THINGS INDEPENDENT OF THIS LANGUAGE THAT WE USE TO CATEGORIZE THEM.
POD1000000023_S0000091	HE HAS A VERY FAMOUS QUOTE THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR US FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EPISODE. HE SAID, QUOTE, THE WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK, ONLY WE DO.
POD1000000023_S0000092	THE WORLD CAN, ONCE WE HAVE PROGRAMMED OURSELVES WITH A LANGUAGE, CAUSE US TO HOLD BELIEFS. BUT IT CANNOT PROPOSE A LANGUAGE FOR US TO SPEAK. ONLY HUMAN BEINGS CAN DO THAT."
POD1000000023_S0000093	SO IT SHOULD BE SAID, RORTY'S NOT TALKING ABOUT ORDINARY LANGUAGE WHEN HE WRITES THAT. HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET DEEP INTO HERE IN A MINUTE. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS COMPARISON HE'S MAKING HERE
POD1000000023_S0000094	BETWEEN ACCESSING THE WORLD VERSUS SOME SORT OF HUMAN CREATED TOOL THAT'S DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE BONDS OF HISTORY AND CULTURE.
POD1000000023_S0000095	THIS IS A CLASSIC MOVE THAT RORTY MAKES THAT, IF YOU WERE NEW TO RORTY, MIGHT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND AN OUTLINE OF SOME OF THE TOPICS HE WANTS TO COVER. FOR EXAMPLE, LANGUAGE IS EXTREMELY USEFUL IN HUMAN AFFAIRS.
POD1000000023_S0000096	IT'S JUST NOT CAPABLE OF DESCRIBING THE WORLD OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES OUTSIDE OF LANGUAGE.
POD1000000023_S0000097	WELL, CONSIDER HOW THIS COMPARES TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE. WE HAVE LOCKE AND KANT TRYING TO USE REASON TO ACCESS SOME SORT OF ULTIMATE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. BUT HERE'S RORTY SAYING THAT RATIONALITY IS MOST USEFUL IN HUMAN AFFAIRS, LIKE THE REALM OF THE POLITICAL.
POD1000000023_S0000098	THE WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK, ONLY WE DO. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE FROM THE ENLIGHTENMENT. PEOPLE LIKE ROUSSEAU, WHO BELIEVE IN SOME SORT OF UNDERLYING HUMAN NATURE. NOBLE SAVAGES, AS HE WOULD SAY.
POD1000000023_S0000099	REALLY BEYOND THAT, ANYONE THAT WANTS TO TAKE UP THE MANTLE OF THE COMMON ATTITUDE THAT HUMAN BEINGS AT THEIR VERY CORE DREAD SEEING OTHER HUMAN BEINGS SUFFER.
POD1000000023_S0000100	THAT'S A COMMON ONE FOR PEOPLE TO HOLD, THAT NATURALLY, AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE IN PAIN. SO WE CAN RELY ON THE FACT THAT IF THINGS EVER GOT BAD ENOUGH, ONE CULTURE WOULD ALWAYS COME TO THE AID OF ANOTHER CULTURE.
POD1000000023_S0000101	RORTY ACTUALLY RESPONDS TO THIS POSITION DIRECTLY IN AN INTERACTION WITH SIMON CRITCHLEY IN THE 90S. SO RIGHT HERE HE'S REFERENCING THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF DEFAULT ALTRUISM EMBEDDED INTO HUMAN NATURE.
POD1000000023_S0000102	HE SAYS, QUOTE, MAYBE THERE IS SUCH A SENTIENT DISPOSITION, BUT IT IS SO MALLEABLE, SO CAPABLE OF BEING COMBINED WITH INDIFFERENCE TO THE SUFFERING OF PEOPLE OF THE WRONG SORTS, THAT IT GIVES US PRECIOUS LITTLE TO RELY ON.
POD1000000023_S0000103	WE SHOULD JUST THANK OUR LUCKY STARS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOWADAYS WHO ARE PRETTY CONSISTENTLY APPALLED BY HUMAN BEINGS SUFFERING UNNECESSARILY."
POD1000000023_S0000104	SO WE'RE SAYING MAYBE THERE IS SOME ASPECT OF HUMAN NATURE THAT MAKES PEOPLE NOT WANT TO SEE OTHERS SUFFER. BUT IF THERE IS, IT'S INCREDIBLY MALLEABLE.
POD1000000023_S0000105	THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS THAT THERE HAPPEN TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING TODAY WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE UNNECESSARY SUFFERING. BUT THE LARGER POINT THERE IS THAT ALSO, IF YOU'RE A FAN OF LIBERALISM,
POD1000000023_S0000106	THERE IS NOTHING WRITTEN INTO NATURE LIKE A GOD OR A PRIORI FACTS THAT SAY LIBERALISM IS THE WAY.
POD1000000023_S0000107	BUT THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS FOR THE LAST COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IN IT AS A STRATEGY.
POD1000000023_S0000108	SO, WHILE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE MOVE THAT RORTY'S MAKING HERE,
POD1000000023_S0000109	PLACING A LOT OF AUTHORITY IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY IMMERSED IN THE CULTURE. THIS MAY START TO BRING UP A WHOLE NEW SET OF QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING MIGHT BE THIS.
POD1000000023_S0000110	IF THE AUTHORITY OF WHETHER A SOCIAL POLICY IS GOOD OR NOT LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE CITIZENS, AND NOT EVEN A PHILOSOPHER CAN ARRIVE AT ABSOLUTE FOUNDATIONS FOR EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS HUMAN RIGHTS,
POD1000000023_S0000111	DON'T THOSE CRITICISMS JUST INSTANTLY EXTEND TO MY BELIEFS AS AN INDIVIDUAL?
POD1000000023_S0000112	LIKE, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GROUND MY WORLDVIEW IN ANYTHING THAT'S ENDURING ENOUGH THAT I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT?
POD1000000023_S0000113	THE SHORT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS THAT YOU CAN'T AND THAT SHOULDN'T BOTHER YOU.
POD1000000023_S0000114	THE LONGER ANSWER CAN BE FOUND IN RORTY'S LENGTHY EXPLORATION OF THE CONCEPT OF IRONY.
POD1000000023_S0000115	LET'S TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. SO A COMMON EMAIL I GET IS FROM A PERSON WHO SAYS SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF THIS.
POD1000000023_S0000116	HI, I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE SHOW FOR A WHILE, I'VE HEARD ABOUT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHERS, AND I'VE GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE I FEEL THE COMPLEXITY OF THINGS MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY UNCERTAIN ABOUT CHOOSING A WORLDVIEW.
POD1000000023_S0000117	SOMETIMES I FEEL AGNOSTIC ABOUT ALMOST EVERY ISSUE OF SUBSTANCE I CAN THINK OF. BUT THIS CREATES A PROBLEM FOR ME, BECAUSE I STILL NEED TO OPERATE IN DAY TO DAY LIFE.
POD1000000023_S0000118	HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO LIVE A LIFE WHERE YOU'RE RADICALLY UNCERTAIN ABOUT THINGS, BUT STILL CAPABLE OF FUNCTIONING ON AN EVERYDAY LEVEL?
POD1000000023_S0000119	THERE ARE MANY ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION, BUT RICHARD RORTY OFFERS ONE OF THEM THROUGH HIS DISCUSSION OF LIVING A LIFE AS AN IRONIST.
POD1000000023_S0000120	NOW, BY IRONIST, HE DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SMELTING METAL DOWN AT THE HOME DEPOT EVERY DAY. THE TERM IRONIST IS A REFERENCE TO IRONY.
POD1000000023_S0000121	TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE LIFE OF AN IRONIST, THOUGH, WE FIRST NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MUCH MORE COMMON, ALMOST UBIQUITOUS WAY THAT PEOPLE APPROACH FIGURING THINGS OUT ABOUT THE WORLD.
POD1000000023_S0000122	A WAY OF THINKING DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.
POD1000000023_S0000123	MOST PEOPLE VIEW THEIR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AS A PERSON, AS A LINEAR PROGRESSION OF MOVING PAST APPEARANCES AND GETTING TO THE REALITY OF THE WORLD.
POD1000000023_S0000124	THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO PLATO'S ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE. SHADOWS ON A CAVE WALL, WE DO THE WORK OF A PHILOSOPHER AND EVENTUALLY CAN ASCEND OUT OF THE CAVE AND SEE THE SUN, OR TRUE KNOWLEDGE FOR WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS.
POD1000000023_S0000125	WELL, THIS WAY OF VIEWING OURSELVES HAS BEEN A FIXTURE IN OUR CULTURES FOR SO LONG THAT IT'S THE WAY MANY PEOPLE SEE THEIR PROCESS OF GROWTH WHEN LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD.
POD1000000023_S0000126	THERE'S THIS INTUITIVE SENSE THAT WE'RE BORN, WE'RE YOUNG, DUMB, NAIVE, WE GET INFORMATION FROM OUR TEACHERS, PARENTS, BASIC NEWS SOURCES, AND THERE'S A SENSE IN WHICH WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF APPEARANCES AT THIS POINT.
POD1000000023_S0000127	SEE, IT'S NOT UNTIL WE'VE DONE THE WORK OF READING FIVE NEWSPAPERS A DAY, READING A THOUSAND BOOKS, TRAVELING TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, NOT UNTIL WE'VE DONE THAT CAN WE SAY THAT WE'VE ARRIVED AT A WORLDVIEW THAT SEES REALITY ON REALITY'S TERMS.
POD1000000023_S0000128	BUT JUST AS THERE'S NO SINGLE THEORY EMBEDDED INTO THE UNIVERSE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS OR POLITICAL STRATEGY OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER,
POD1000000023_S0000129	THERE'S NO SINGLE CORRECT VIEW OF EXISTENCE THAT YOU'RE SOMEHOW ACCESSING THROUGH LIFE EXPERIENCES AND READING A BUNCH OF STUFF.
POD1000000023_S0000130	YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU HAVE A RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR EVERY VIEW THAT YOU HOLD. YOU MAY THINK IT'S THE GREATEST WORLDVIEW THAT'S EVER BEEN CREATED.
POD1000000023_S0000131	BUT IT WAS CREATED BY YOU, BY A HUMAN BEING. AND RORTY WOULD SAY THAT ALTHOUGH WE OFTEN DECEIVE OURSELVES INTO THINKING IT'S THE TRUTH,
POD1000000023_S0000132	REALLY WHAT WE'VE CREATED HERE IS WHAT HE CALLS A FINAL VOCABULARY.
POD1000000023_S0000133	MORE ON FINAL VOCABULARIES IN ONE SECOND, BUT FIRST I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR RORTY TALK ABOUT A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOMEONE SAYING, THE WORLD IS OUT THERE, AND SAYING, THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.
POD1000000023_S0000134	AND HOW THESE STATEMENTS ULTIMATELY RELATE TO THE LANGUAGE WE USE. HE SAYS, QUOTE, WE NEED TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CLAIM THAT THE WORLD IS OUT THERE AND THE CLAIM THAT THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.
POD1000000023_S0000135	TO SAY THAT THE WORLD IS OUT THERE, THAT IT IS NOT OUR CREATION, IS TO SAY WITH COMMON SENSE THAT MOST THINGS IN SPACE AND TIME ARE THE EFFECTS OF CAUSES WHICH DO NOT INCLUDE HUMAN MENTAL STATES.
POD1000000023_S0000136	TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH IS NOT OUT THERE IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT WHERE THERE ARE NO SENTENCES, THERE IS NO TRUTH. THAT SENTENCES ARE ELEMENTS OF HUMAN LANGUAGES.
POD1000000023_S0000137	AND THAT HUMAN LANGUAGES ARE HUMAN CREATIONS. TRUTH CANNOT BE OUT THERE. IT CANNOT EXIST INDEPENDENTLY OF THE HUMAN MIND.
POD1000000023_S0000138	BECAUSE SENTENCES CANNOT SO EXIST OR BE OUT THERE. THE WORLD IS OUT THERE, BUT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WORLD ARE NOT.
POD1000000023_S0000139	ONLY DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WORLD CAN BE TRUE OR FALSE. THE WORLD ON ITS OWN, UNAIDED BY THE DESCRIBING ACTIVITIES OF HUMAN BEINGS, CANNOT."
POD1000000023_S0000140	THIS IS ONE OF RORTY'S MOST FAMOUS CONCEPTS, WHAT MANY REFER TO AS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MAKING AND FINDING.
POD1000000023_S0000141	LOCKE AND KANT ARE NOT FINDING THE TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY ARE USING A VERY HUMAN PROCESS CALLED REASON TO MAKE A TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS THAT WE THEN USE TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETIES.
POD1000000023_S0000142	LIBERALISM WAS NOT FOUND TO BE THE BEST POLITICAL STRATEGY. HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND COMMON VALUES AMONG PEOPLE MADE IT THE BEST POLITICAL STRATEGY FOR A TIME.
POD1000000023_S0000143	WHEN YOU READ A THOUSAND BOOKS, YOU ARE NOT FINDING THE TRUTH ABOUT EXISTENCE. YOU ARE MAKING A FINAL VOCABULARY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO INTERFACE WITH REALITY DURING THE SPECIFIC TIME THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE LIVING.
POD1000000023_S0000144	BY FINAL VOCABULARY, RORTY MEANS A COLLECTION OF STORIES, METAPHORS, NARRATIVES, DISCOURSES, TONS OF DIFFERENT TOOLS OF RHETORIC THAT YOU USE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD AND SEE YOUR PLACE IN IT.
POD1000000023_S0000145	THIS IS CALLED A FINAL VOCABULARY BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT MAKE IT UP ARE OFTEN VERY FINAL. THE FOUNDATIONS ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DEVELOP ANY FURTHER BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, IF YOU ARE PRESSED HARD ENOUGH,
POD1000000023_S0000146	TO EXPLAIN YOUR WORLDVIEW BY SOMEBODY SKILLED ENOUGH AT ARGUING, WITH ENOUGH TIME ON THEIR HANDS, RORTY SAYS THAT EVENTUALLY, THERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN WHY YOUR WORLDVIEW IS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S IN A NON CIRCULAR WAY.
POD1000000023_S0000147	IT IS A COURAGEOUS THING TO FIGHT AND DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE, LOOK, FIGHTING AND DYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS THINGS YOU CAN DO. THE BIBLE IS TRUE, SO YOU SHOULD TRUST THE WORD OF GOD.
POD1000000023_S0000148	WHEN PRESSED HARD ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY YOUR WORLDVIEW IN A CONVERSATION, THESE ARE THE SORTS OF STORIES AND METAPHORS THAT GROUND THE VALUES OF SOMEONE THAT THINKS THEY'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
POD1000000023_S0000149	WHEN THE MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION IS THAT THEY SET UP CAMP IN AN ECHO CHAMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T CALL THEM ON THEIR MISTAKES.
POD1000000023_S0000150	EITHER BECAUSE THEY ONLY TALK TO PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY AGREE WITH THEM ALREADY OR BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH THEM THAT THEY ALLOW INTO THEIR CIRCLES LACK THE ABILITY TO PRESS THEM FURTHER. MAYBE PEOPLE JUST WANT TO BE POLITE.
POD1000000023_S0000151	MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT CHANGING SOMEONE INTO A LITTLE VERSION OF THEM TO SPEND THEIR TIME DOING IT.
POD1000000023_S0000152	RORTY PRESCRIBES AN ANTIDOTE TO THIS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT GETTING PAST APPEARANCES TO THE REALITY OF THE WORLD. HERE'S A PRETTY FAMOUS PASSAGE FROM HIS WORK THAT DESCRIBES HIS THREE CRITERIA FOR LIVING LIFE AS AN IRONIST.
POD1000000023_S0000153	HE SAYS, QUOTE, I SHALL DEFINE AN IRONIST AS SOMEONE WHO FULFILLS THREE CONDITIONS.
POD1000000023_S0000154	1. SHE HAS RADICAL AND CONTINUING DOUBTS ABOUT THE FINAL VOCABULARY SHE CURRENTLY USES BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN IMPRESSED BY OTHER VOCABULARIES, VOCABULARIES TAKEN AS FINAL BY PEOPLE OR BOOKS SHE HAS ENCOUNTERED.
POD1000000023_S0000155	TWO, SHE REALIZES THAT ARGUMENT PHRASED IN HER PRESENT VOCABULARY CAN NEITHER UNDERWRITE NOR DISSOLVE THESE DOUBTS.
POD1000000023_S0000156	3. INSOFAR AS SHE PHILOSOPHIZES ABOUT HER SITUATION, SHE DOES NOT THINK THAT HER VOCABULARY IS CLOSER TO REALITY THAN OTHERS, THAT IT IS IN TOUCH WITH A POWER NOT HERSELF.
POD1000000023_S0000157	IRONISTS WHO ARE INCLINED TO PHILOSOPHIZE SEE THE CHOICE BETWEEN VOCABULARIES AS MADE NEITHER WITHIN A NEUTRAL OR UNIVERSAL META VOCABULARY, NOT BY AN ATTEMPT TO FIGHT ONE'S WAY PAST APPEARANCES TO THE REAL, BUT SIMPLY BY PLAYING THE NEW OFF AGAINST THE OLD.
POD1000000023_S0000158	SO IMAGINE LIVING LIFE AS AN IRONIST AS OPPOSED TO THIS OTHER TYPE OF PERSON WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.
POD1000000023_S0000159	YOU'D LIVE YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE NOT LIKE PYRRHO FROM ANCIENT ATHENS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK IN FRONT OF CARS DOUBTING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THERE. YOU'D HAVE A SORT OF WORKING THEORY, A FINAL VOCABULARY THAT YOU USE TO FUNCTION.
POD1000000023_S0000160	THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN OTHER FINAL VOCABULARIES, SEEN THEIR WEAKNESSES,
POD1000000023_S0000161	AND YOU'D REALIZE THAT YOURS IS PROBABLY EQUALLY AS FLAWED AS THEIRS IS IN SOME WAY. BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE SPECIAL ACCESS TO THE TRUTH.
POD1000000023_S0000162	YOU DON'T HAVE A DEITY BACKING YOUR WORLDVIEW. YOU DON'T HAVE SOME NEUTRAL POINT OUTSIDE OF CULTURE AND HISTORY THAT YOU'RE DOING YOUR THINKING FROM. YOU ARE JUST AS FALLIBLE AS THEY ARE.
POD1000000023_S0000163	AND YOUR CONCLUSIONS RELY ON HISTORY AND CULTURE JUST AS MUCH AS THEIRS DO, YOU WOULD HAVE CONTINUING RADICAL DOUBT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY.
POD1000000023_S0000164	YOU'D ALSO REALIZE THAT ANY ATTEMPT BY YOU TO ARGUE THAT YOUR FINAL VOCABULARY IS SOMEHOW SUPERIOR TO OTHERS IS A POINTLESS EXERCISE, AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU ENGAGING IN THAT CIRCULAR REASONING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE.
POD1000000023_S0000165	BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT, YOU'RE ARGUING FOR A SET OF STORIES AND NARRATIVES AS BEING SUPERIOR, BUT ALL THE WHILE YOU'RE USING THAT SET OF STORIES AND NARRATIVES AS THE PREMISE THAT YOU'RE STARTING YOUR ARGUMENTS FROM.
POD1000000023_S0000166	THIS IS WHY RORTY THINKS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR FINAL VOCABULARIES, ARGUING IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF MAKING ANY PROGRESS AT ALL.
POD1000000023_S0000167	RORTY SAYS THAT AN IRONIST ALWAYS REALIZES THAT ANYTHING CAN BE MADE TO LOOK GOOD OR BAD BY BEING REDESCRIBED.
POD1000000023_S0000168	BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME SINGLE ARGUMENTATIVE STANDARD OUT THERE.
POD1000000023_S0000169	WINNING AN ARGUMENT IN THE TIMES OF NAPOLEON IS JUST FAR DIFFERENT THAN WINNING AN ARGUMENT TODAY.
POD1000000023_S0000170	BECAUSE THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE JUDGING HAVE CHANGED, THE HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED, THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE WORLD FITS TOGETHER HAS CHANGED, DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DIFFERENT FINAL VOCABULARIES.
POD1000000023_S0000171	SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE WITH SOMEONE, YOU ARE ALWAYS RELYING ON THE FACT THAT YOUR POINTS ARE GOING TO FIT WELL INTO THE FINAL VOCABULARY OF THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE ARGUING WITH, WHICH IS FAR FROM A GUARANTEE.
POD1000000023_S0000172	AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS THAT YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF CONSTANTLY ARGUING AGAINST A PARTICULAR COMMON FINAL VOCABULARY THAT HAPPENS TO DOMINATE THE CULTURE YOU WERE BORN INTO.
POD1000000023_S0000173	BETTER TO INSTEAD LEAD BY EXAMPLE THROUGH IRONY. WHEN SOMEONE THINKS THEY'VE LASSOED THE TRUTH WITH THEIR VOCABULARY, THEY GOT IT.
POD1000000023_S0000174	THE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD WILL ALWAYS BE TO DO WHAT RORTY CALLS IRONIC DISRUPTION. WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU PULL OUT YOUR RICHARD RORTY HANDBOOK AND ARGUE THEM DOWN POINT BY POINT UNTIL THEY SEE THE WORLD THE WAY THAT YOU DO.
POD1000000023_S0000175	THE GOAL IS, THROUGH ONE METHOD OR ANOTHER, USUALLY RHETORICAL DEVICES.
POD1000000023_S0000176	YOU TRY TO ALLOW THIS PERSON TO SEE ON THEIR OWN THE PERSPECTIVE FROM OUTSIDE THEIR SINGLE WORLDVIEW, THE HOPE BEING THAT ONCE THEY'RE IN THIS PLACE, THEY'LL REALIZE HOW LIMITING THEIR BASIC WAY OF VIEWING THE WORLD IS.
POD1000000023_S0000177	BECAUSE IT COMPLETELY CLOSES THEM OFF FROM NEW WAYS OF CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND THE WORLD THAT IS OUT THERE. ONCE AGAIN, THE WORLD THAT IS OUT THERE, NOT THE TRUTH THAT IS OUT THERE.
POD1000000023_S0000178	TO BE IN THIS PLACE, STEPPING OUTSIDE OF YOUR WORLDVIEW AND SEEING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY THE WORLD COULD BE RATIONALLY JUSTIFIED, CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE.
POD1000000023_S0000179	SHOULD BE SAID, THIS PROCESS ALSO BENEFITS THE IRONIST, BECAUSE THEY NEED AS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH FINAL VOCABULARIES AS THEY CAN GET. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPOT THESE FROM A MILE AWAY.
POD1000000023_S0000180	RORTY SAYS IN A PASSAGE THAT AN IRONIST IS NEVER QUITE ABLE TO TAKE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY.
POD1000000023_S0000181	BECAUSE THEY LIVED THEIR LIFE ACKNOWLEDGING HOW MUCH OF THEIR FINAL VOCABULARY WASN'T EVEN A CHOICE THEY CONSCIOUSLY MADE.
POD1000000023_S0000182	AND THAT AT ANY POINT, SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY BELIEVE IN MOST STRONGLY TODAY MIGHT TOMORROW CHANGE IN A SINGLE CONVERSATION.
POD1000000023_S0000183	THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO YOUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF APPROACHING CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH YOU POLITICALLY.
POD1000000023_S0000184	THIS PERSON WOULD SEEM LIKE AN ALIEN IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE. BUT THIS IS ULTIMATELY THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT EMERGES IN A PLURALISTIC LANDSCAPE OF IDEAS, RATHER THAN ONE THAT BELIEVES IN A SINGLE CORRECT ANSWER TO EVERY POLITICAL QUESTION.
POD1000000023_S0000185	SO YOU MAY WONDER, WHY BOTHER? WHY EVEN SPEND A SECOND OF MY LIFE TRYING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY SHOWING THEM HOW THEY'RE LIMITING THEMSELVES TO A SINGLE ANSWER?
POD1000000023_S0000186	LET THEM DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE GONNA DO.
POD1000000023_S0000187	THIS OUTDATED, OVERSIMPLIFIED ATTITUDE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MUCH OF THE CRUELTY THAT GOES ON IN THIS WORLD.
POD1000000023_S0000188	LIBERAL SOCIETY, IN HIS EYES, HAS A CONSTANT OBLIGATION TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THE WAYS THAT THE CURRENT ORDER OF THINGS MIGHT BE HURTING PEOPLE AROUND US. MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU HAVE A PLURALISTIC OUTLOOK.
POD1000000023_S0000190	YOU KNOW, THERE ARE RELATIVISTS OUT THERE THAT WOULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD STOP FIGHTING OVER THEIR PETTY DISAGREEMENTS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY EVERYTHING IS ARBITRARY.
POD1000000023_S0000191	THERE ARE CAPITAL R RATIONALISTS OUT THERE THAT'LL SAY EVERYONE SHOULD STOP FIGHTING BECAUSE, WELL, I'VE COME UP WITH THE RIGHT ANSWER. I FOUND IT. NO MORE WORK TO BE DONE.
POD1000000023_S0000192	THE WAY RICHARD RORTY WALKS THIS LINE OF NATURE AND CULTURE IS PARTIALLY THROUGH HIS BEAUTIFUL USE OF PRAGMATISM. YOU KNOW, RORTY WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE LESS. HE WOULDN'T SAY YOU SHOULD CARE MORE.
POD1000000023_S0000193	WHAT HE WOULD SAY, I THINK, THOUGH, IS THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT WE CARE ABOUT LIES IN SOLIDARITY AMONGST FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS.
POD1000000023_S0000194	THAT SOLIDARITY IS WHAT KEEPS US IN LINE, NOT A COSMIC LAW. THAT SOLIDARITY IS WHAT DETERMINES OUR VALUES, NOT SOME PHILOSOPHER UP IN A TOWER.
POD1000000023_S0000195	TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU LIVE IN IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE SOLIDARITY THAT HOLDS SOCIETY TOGETHER.
POD1000000023_S0000196	HE SAID IT WELL WHEN DESCRIBING ONE OF HIS BOOKS HERE, AND ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGES FROM ANY OF HIS WORK.
POD1000000023_S0000197	HE SAYS, QUOTE,
POD1000000023_S0000198	END QUOTE.
POD1000000023_S0000199	THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I'LL TALK TO YOU NEXT TIME.
POD1000000024_S0000000	I DREADED DOING THE SHOW SOMETIMES BECAUSE WHATEVER. IT WAS.
POD1000000024_S0000001	FEELINGS.
POD1000000024_S0000002	YEAH, FEELINGS. FEELINGS.
POD1000000024_S0000003	I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD SORT OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AT THAT POINT THAT THINGS WERE STRAINED BETWEEN US.
POD1000000024_S0000004	BUT WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT AS CLOSE AS WE HAD ONCE BEEN BY THE TIME THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING.
POD1000000024_S0000005	AND PART OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS ABOUT THE WEIRD DUALITY BETWEEN BECOMING RECOGNIZED AS FRIENDS MORE PUBLICLY
POD1000000024_S0000006	EVEN AS WE WERE SPENDING LESS TIME IN THAT KIND OF INTIMATE COMMUNICATION THAT REALLY MAKES A FRIENDSHIP FEEL SAFE AND SECURE.
POD1000000024_S0000007	I DON'T KNOW, DOES THAT FEEL RIGHT TO YOU? SORRY.
POD1000000024_S0000008	THAT FEELS SO RIGHT. PLEASE BE MY SPOKESPERSON FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU.
POD1000000024_S0000010	I'M ANNE FRIEDMAN, CO HOST OF THE PODCAST, CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND, AND A JOURNALIST.
POD1000000024_S0000011	AND MY NAME IS AMINATOU SOW.
POD1000000024_S0000012	I AM THE OTHER CO HOST OF CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND THE CO AUTHOR OF BIG FRIENDSHIP WITH ANNE FRIEDMAN.
POD1000000024_S0000013	AMINATOU SOW IS A MEDIA STRATEGIST WHO WAS NAMED TO FORBES' 30 UNDER 30.
POD1000000024_S0000014	ANNE FRIEDMAN IS A JOURNALIST WHOSE WRITING HAS BEEN IN PLACES LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES, ELLE, AND THE GUARDIAN.
POD1000000024_S0000015	THEY'VE BEEN BEST FRIENDS SINCE 2009, BUT FOR MOST OF THAT TIME, THEY'VE LIVED ON OPPOSITE COASTS.
POD1000000024_S0000016	IN 2014, THEY STARTED CO HOSTING THE PODCAST, CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND, WHOSE TAGLINE IS, A PODCAST FOR LONG DISTANCE BESTIES EVERYWHERE.
POD1000000024_S0000017	IT GETS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LISTENERS.
POD1000000024_S0000018	THEY RECORD IT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES, JUST LIKE THEY DID FOR THE INTERVIEW FOR THIS EPISODE.
POD1000000024_S0000019	BUT MAINTAINING A FRIENDSHIP ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS A PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY.
POD1000000024_S0000020	THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM TURNED INTO EMOTIONAL DISTANCE, AND THEY HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RECONNECT.
POD1000000024_S0000021	THEY'VE CO WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT CALLED BIG FRIENDSHIP, WHICH COMES OUT IN JULY.
POD1000000024_S0000022	BUT THAT PROJECT IS JUST THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THEIR STORY, WHICH STARTED OVER A DECADE AGO.
POD1000000024_S0000023	HERE'S AMINATOU.
POD1000000024_S0000025	ANNA AND I MET AT A GOSSIP GIRL VIEWING PARTY IN WASHINGTON DC IN 2009.
POD1000000024_S0000026	GOSSIP GIRL WAS IMPORTANT THEN, IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TODAY.
POD1000000024_S0000028	THAT PARTY WAS HOSTED BY OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, DIO.
POD1000000024_S0000029	SHE SPECIFICALLY INVITED BOTH OF US TO THAT PARTY, HAVING ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY GET ALONG AND BE FRIENDS.
POD1000000024_S0000030	IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEONE WOULD SET YOU UP ON A BLIND DATE ROMANTICALLY.
POD1000000024_S0000031	THIS WAS LIKE A FRIENDSHIP LIKE SETUP.
POD1000000024_S0000032	I DO REMEMBER JUST FEELING LIKE EVERY COMMENT AND EVERY JOKE AND EVERY LITTLE LIKE ASIDE OR CONTRIBUTION SHE MADE TO THE KIND OF META CONVERSATION HAPPENING ABOUT THE TV SHOW WAS JUST SPOT ON.
POD1000000024_S0000033	AND JUST BEING LIKE, I COULD BE HERE FOREVER AND LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE WORD THAT COMES OUT OF THIS WOMAN'S MOUTH.
POD1000000024_S0000034	I JUST REALLY LIKED YOUR OUTFIT, ANNE.
POD1000000024_S0000035	WOW.
POD1000000024_S0000036	I WAS LIKE, YES, FINALLY, A GOOD OUTFIT IN THIS TOWN.
POD1000000024_S0000037	LIKE I REMEMBER THAT BEING REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
POD1000000024_S0000038	BUT I JUST REMEMBER REALLY APPRECIATING THAT THIS PERSON WAS BOTH LIKE HILARIOUS AND ALSO SMART.
POD1000000024_S0000039	AND THEN MUCH LATER WHEN I CONNECTED THE DOTS TO THE FACT THAT, OH, YOU WERE THE ANNE FRIEDMAN WHOSE BYLINE I HAD READ BEFORE, I WAS LIKE, GREAT.
POD1000000024_S0000040	EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW, OF COURSE.
POD1000000024_S0000041	THIS WOMAN WHO WEARS THIS JEANS AND T SHIRTS SITUATION SO PERFECTLY ALSO HAS LIKE 10 OUT OF 10 TASTE IN TEEN TELEVISION.
POD1000000024_S0000042	AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL FOR ME.
POD1000000024_S0000043	IT JUST WAS EASY RIGHT AWAY.
POD1000000024_S0000044	AND SO THINGS ESCALATED LIKE VERY FAST.
POD1000000024_S0000045	WE REALLY WENT ZERO TO A HUNDRED IN LIKE THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS.
POD1000000024_S0000046	WHEN I PICTURE THIS TIME IN OUR LIVES, I JUST PICTURE US SPENDING DOZENS OF HOURS ON ONE OF OUR COUCHES.
POD1000000024_S0000047	WE JUST SPENT SO MANY HOURS DOING NOTHING.
POD1000000024_S0000048	AND IN THAT WAY, IT FELT VERY MUCH LIKE A COLLEGE OR A TEEN FRIENDSHIP TO ME.
POD1000000024_S0000049	OUR 20S WERE VERY MUCH MARKED BY A LOT OF BIG GROUP HANGS, YOU KNOW?
POD1000000024_S0000050	BUT I THINK THAT FOR ME, THAT WHEN I KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN IT WAS OKAY TO BE LIKE, ACTUALLY, I DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THAT.
POD1000000024_S0000051	I JUST WANT TO BE TAKING OUR BRAS OFF ON THE COUCH AND JUST TALKING ABOUT MUNDANE STUFF OR LIKE READING SIDE BY SIDE, LIKE NOT REALLY SAYING ANYTHING TO EACH OTHER.
POD1000000024_S0000052	I HAD BEEN LIVING WITH A BOYFRIEND AND WE BROKE UP WHEN YOU AND I HAD BEEN FRIENDS FOR SIX MONTHS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
POD1000000024_S0000053	AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO REVISE MY HR PAPERWORK AT WORK, LIKE WHO IS YOUR NEXT OF KIN OR WHATEVER THEY MAKE YOU PUT DOWN FOR WORK EMERGENCIES.
POD1000000024_S0000054	AT THAT POINT, IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT IT WAS YOU.
POD1000000024_S0000055	YEAH, BY THAT POINT YOU WERE SOMEONE IN MY LIFE WHERE I WAS LIKE, YES, LIKE GIVE HER MY 401K.
POD1000000024_S0000056	LIKE, PLEASE CALL HER IF I SLIP ON A BANANA AT WORK.
POD1000000024_S0000058	THIS IS THE ONLY CAPABLE PERSON IN MY LIFE. THANK YOU.
POD1000000024_S0000059	YOUR JOB AT THE BANANA FACTORY.
POD1000000024_S0000061	THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW!
POD1000000024_S0000063	IF I'M FOUND IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE, I HOPE THAT MY PHONE LITERALLY SAYS, PLEASE CALL ANNE FRIEDMAN.
POD1000000024_S0000065	BUT WE HAVE NOW BEEN FRIENDS WHO LIVE APART FOR MUCH LONGER THAN WE WERE FRIENDS WHO LIVED IN THE SAME CITY.
POD1000000024_S0000066	I KNEW THAT EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD MOVE BECAUSE WE LIVED IN A VERY TRANSITIONAL KIND OF CITY.
POD1000000024_S0000067	AND WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT AND IT WAS LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION, LIKE PEOPLE MOVED TO GO TO JOBS LIKE ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.
POD1000000024_S0000068	SO IT WAS NOT LIKE IT WAS A SURPRISE THAT ONE OF US WOULD HAVE TO MOVE.
POD1000000024_S0000069	IT JUST FELT TOO SOON.
POD1000000024_S0000070	YEAH, AND IT'S FUNNY WHEN I THINK ABOUT MAKING THAT DECISION, IT WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN WORK FOR ME.
POD1000000024_S0000071	EVEN THOUGH OBVIOUSLY I WAS PHYSICALLY LEAVING, OUR ABILITY TO SPEND ALL THESE HOURS ON THE COUCH TOGETHER,
POD1000000024_S0000072	I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS GOING TO END OR EVEN BE EXISTENTIALLY THREATENED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS MOVING AWAY.
POD1000000024_S0000073	AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I WASN'T SAD ABOUT IT OR THAT IT WAS EASY.
POD1000000024_S0000074	IT'S JUST AT THE TIME, IT REALLY JUST FELT LIKE, OK, WE ARE GOING TO BE AS CLOSE AS WE EVER WERE.
POD1000000024_S0000075	IT'S JUST GONNA LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
POD1000000024_S0000076	I WAS DEVASTATED WHEN YOU MOVED AWAY, ANNE. AND I REMEMBER VERY CONSCIOUSLY HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE OF LIKE, I WILL NEVER SHOW THIS PERSON THAT I AM BUMMED OUT BY THIS.
POD1000000024_S0000077	BECAUSE I KNEW JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR YOU. AND I WAS ALSO REALLY EXCITED FOR YOU THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY ON A PATH TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO DO.
POD1000000024_S0000078	I DON'T SHINE, IF YOU DON'T SHINE IS SOMETHING THAT AMINA FIRST SAID TO ME, AND THEN WE WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER.
POD1000000024_S0000079	MOSTLY, I THINK, AS AN ASSURANCE WHEN ONE OF US WAS WORRIED SHE WAS TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE IN THE OTHER'S BRAIN OR LIFE OR WHATEVER.
POD1000000024_S0000080	MAYBE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH SUPPORT OR HELP, A WAY OF REASSURING EACH OTHER THAT WE WERE INVESTED IN EACH OTHER.
POD1000000024_S0000081	AND I DON'T SHINE IF YOU DON'T SHINE WAS THE ASSURANCE THAT UNDERPINNED A LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.
POD1000000024_S0000082	I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT COLLABORATION IS BETTER THAN COMPETITION.
POD1000000024_S0000083	EVERY SUCCESS IN MY LIFE IS A TESTAMENT TO THAT.
POD1000000024_S0000084	AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE, WE STARTED CALLING IT SHINE THEORY PRIVATELY.
POD1000000024_S0000085	AND THEN IN 2013, I WAS A COLUMNIST FOR THE CUT AND WROTE ABOUT IT IN A COLUMN.
POD1000000024_S0000086	AND LOTS OF PEOPLE READ AND SHARED THE COLUMN, AND THEN IT BECAME A LOT BIGGER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED.
POD1000000024_S0000087	BUT LIKE ALL THINGS THAT GO VIRAL, THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS. WE WERE LIKE, GREAT, IS EVERYONE REALLY ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?
POD1000000024_S0000088	I REMEMBER MUCH TO MY SURPRISE AND HORROR, SHINETHEORY.COM HAD ALREADY BEEN BOUGHT.
POD1000000024_S0000089	A WOMAN WHO RAN A FITNESS STUDIO WAS USING IT TO PUSH SOME SORT OF MISS FITNESS STUDIO CONTEST.
POD1000000024_S0000090	MY NAME WAS ON THE WEBSITE.
POD1000000024_S0000091	AND SO A LAWYER WAS HIRED.
POD1000000024_S0000092	AND I THINK THAT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU, ANNE, LIKE, I MAKE DECISIONS DIFFERENTLY WHEN I'M MAKING DECISIONS WITH SOMEONE THAN I DO IF I'M MAKING THEM FOR MYSELF.
POD1000000024_S0000093	YOU REALLY LEARN THAT LIKE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT APPETITES FOR NEGOTIATION.
POD1000000024_S0000094	AND PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT STYLE THAT THEY WANT TO BE COMBATIVE OR NOT COMBATIVE IN AND WHATEVER.
POD1000000024_S0000095	I THINK THAT HAVING TO SORT OUT A LOT OF THOSE KINKS THROUGH THIS PROCESS ILLUMINATED A LOT OF THINGS.
POD1000000024_S0000096	AND ONE OF THEM BEING LIKE, OKAY, THIS REALLY SUCKS, BUT I REALLY LIKE THE PERSON I HAVE TO DO THIS WITH.
POD1000000024_S0000097	IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION THIS BIG TOGETHER.
POD1000000024_S0000098	YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS LIKE, THAT WAS NOT FALLING APART.
POD1000000024_S0000099	THE POINT AT WHICH WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE SHINE THEORY TRADEMARK WAS ACTUALLY SEVERAL MONTHS, OR MAYBE EVEN DRAGGED OUT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.
POD1000000024_S0000100	AND IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME, I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD SORT OF AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT AT THAT POINT THAT THINGS WERE STRAINED BETWEEN US.
POD1000000024_S0000101	BUT WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT AS CLOSE AS WE HAD ONCE BEEN BY THE TIME THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING.
POD1000000024_S0000102	I THINK THAT WE ARE ENTERING INTO A PERIOD WHERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE WERE COMPARTMENTALIZING WERE STARTING TO BECOME PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW?
POD1000000024_S0000103	LIKE WE WERE BOTH CHANGING AND GOING THROUGH REALLY HARD THINGS IN OUR OWN LIVES, VERY FAR APART PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY IN MOST CASES.
POD1000000024_S0000104	AND I THINK FOR ME ALSO, LIKE THIS HAS BEEN THE CENTRAL, THE LESSON THAT I AM LEARNING AS I GROW UP EVERY DAY.
POD1000000024_S0000105	PEOPLE ARE CHANGING CONSTANTLY.
POD1000000024_S0000106	AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO DO A CHECK IN EVERY DAY AND REALIZE THAT YOU WERE DIFFERENT THAN YOU WERE YESTERDAY.
POD1000000024_S0000107	AND SO I THINK THAT EVEN IF WE WERE LIKE LIVING IN THE SAME CITY OR WE, YOU KNOW, LIKE BOUGHT A HOUSE TOGETHER AND WE WERE ROOMMATES OR WHATEVER, I STILL THINK THAT WE WOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
POD1000000024_S0000108	CLINGING ON TO AN IDEA OF WHO I THINK SOMEONE IS IS VERY REASSURING.
POD1000000024_S0000109	BUT IN THAT, YOU DON'T GIVE PEOPLE ROOM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS OR TO EXPLORE NEW THINGS OR TO DO NEW THINGS.
POD1000000024_S0000110	WE WERE DIFFERENT AND WE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN WE WERE CHANGING AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE WERE CHANGING.
POD1000000024_S0000111	AND THERE WAS SO MUCH TO ACCOUNT FOR IN THAT GAP.
POD1000000024_S0000112	AND SO FOR EACH OF US, DECIDING TO SHARE LESS OF OURSELVES WAS SOMETIMES A CONSCIOUS AND SOMETIMES A TOTALLY UNCONSCIOUS REFLEXIVE DECISION.
POD1000000024_S0000113	YET WE HAD ALL OF THIS COMMUNICATION RELATED TO HOSTING A PODCAST TOGETHER.
POD1000000024_S0000114	FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, THE ONLY PODCAST THAT I LISTENED TO WAS THIS AMERICAN LIFE.
POD1000000024_S0000115	SO IT NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WAS SOMETHING WE COULD DO.
POD1000000024_S0000116	BUT I HAD MET GINA DELVAC, OUR PRODUCER, THROUGH ANNE AND SOME OF ANNE'S FRIENDS IN LA AND AT SOME POINT SOMEWHERE IN PALM SPRINGS.
POD1000000024_S0000117	LIKE BETWEEN PROBABLY DRUGS AND WINE FOR ME, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD DO A PODCAST.
POD1000000024_S0000118	I THINK SHE WAS JUST LIKE, YOU GUYS HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY AND YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING THIS.
POD1000000024_S0000119	AND I AM ALSO PRETTY SURE WE SAID THAT STANDARD THING THAT I HEAR MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE WOMEN SAY WHEN YOU SUGGEST THEY RECORD THEMSELVES, WHICH IS, I HATE MY VOICE, SO WHY WOULD I DO THAT? OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
POD1000000024_S0000120	I'M PRETTY SURE WE WERE KIND OF DISMISSIVE, BUT THEN ALSO THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND TALKED ABOUT IT.
POD1000000024_S0000121	SEVERAL WEEKS LATER.
POD1000000024_S0000122	DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE IN THE CAR AND YOU BOUGHT THE URL ON YOUR PHONE?
POD1000000024_S0000123	YES, WE CAME UP WITH THE NAME IN THE CAR.
POD1000000024_S0000124	I CONFESS THAT IF I HAD REALLY SAT THERE AND THOUGHT FOR LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS, THE SHOW PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE CALLED CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
POD1000000024_S0000125	IT WOULD BE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE.
POD1000000024_S0000126	INDEED.
POD1000000024_S0000127	BUT THIS IS HOW WE WORK.
POD1000000024_S0000128	NOTHING IS REAL UNLESS THERE IS A WEBSITE.
POD1000000024_S0000129	NOTHING IS REAL UNLESS YOU'VE HAD A MEETING ABOUT IT.
POD1000000024_S0000130	AND GINA HAD DONE ALL OF THE WORK TO SAY, THIS IS WHAT WE THINK IT COULD BE.
POD1000000024_S0000131	AND BECAUSE SHE DID THAT, IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE COULD ACTUALLY DO IT.
POD1000000024_S0000132	WE DIDN'T THINK THAT TONS OF STRANGERS WOULD LISTEN TO IT.
POD1000000024_S0000133	I THINK THAT A HUGE PART OF THE SHOW'S SUCCESS, HONESTLY, IS THAT WE BACKED INTO ALL OF THESE THINGS.
POD1000000024_S0000134	IF THEY HAD COME TO ME AND SAID, HEY, DO YOU WANT TO RUN A SMALL MEDIA COMPANY WHERE WE HAVE TO GET A GOVERNMENT EIN AND WE HAVE TO DO PAYROLL?
POD1000000024_S0000135	I WOULD HAVE SAID, ABSOLUTELY NOT, PLEASE NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO.
POD1000000024_S0000136	AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY DUMB THING TO SAY NOW, BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT OUR FRIENDS WOULD LISTEN TO IT.
POD1000000024_S0000137	HI, WELCOME TO CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
POD1000000024_S0000138	A PODCAST FOR LONG DISTANCE BESTIES EVERYWHERE.
POD1000000024_S0000139	USUALLY WE ARE LONG DISTANCE BESTIES, BUT TODAY WE ARE IN THE SAME ROOM.
POD1000000024_S0000140	I KNOW, WE'RE CHEATING AND I LOVE IT.
POD1000000024_S0000141	BUT I DREADED DOING THE SHOW SOMETIMES BECAUSE WHATEVER.
POD1000000024_S0000142	FEELINGS
POD1000000024_S0000143	YEAH, FEELINGS.
POD1000000024_S0000144	WHEN WE ARE NOT COMMUNICATING WELL AND YOU ADD DISTANCE TO IT, LIKE, THAT WAS AN ISSUE.
POD1000000024_S0000145	OR ALWAYS THINKING LIKE, OKAY, WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS LATER.
POD1000000024_S0000146	THERE WAS ALWAYS LIKE A THING, YOU KNOW, LIKE A SMALL THING THAT YOU WOULD DEAL WITH LATER. AND THEN THAT JAR GOT FULL AND YOU'RE LIKE, OH, THIS IS A LOT OF STUFF.
POD1000000024_S0000147	AND IT HAPPENED IN SO MANY LITTLE WAYS THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY EVEN FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT UNTIL THINGS HAD GOTTEN REALLY BAD.
POD1000000024_S0000148	AND I THINK PART OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS ABOUT THE WEIRD DUALITY BETWEEN BECOMING RECOGNIZED AS FRIENDS MORE PUBLICLY
POD1000000024_S0000149	EVEN AS WE WERE SPENDING LESS TIME IN THAT KIND OF INTIMATE COMMUNICATION THAT REALLY MAKES A FRIENDSHIP FEEL SAFE AND SECURE.
POD1000000024_S0000150	I DON'T KNOW, DOES THAT FEEL RIGHT TO YOU? SORRY.
POD1000000024_S0000152	THAT FEELS SO RIGHT. PLEASE BE MY SPOKESPERSON FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU.
POD1000000024_S0000154	THERE WAS SORT OF THIS ILLUSION THAT WE WERE STILL IN TOUCH IN THE SAME WAY WE HAD ALWAYS BEEN.
POD1000000024_S0000155	EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY TALKING IN TRULY INTIMATE WAYS ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN EACH OF OUR LIVES.
POD1000000024_S0000156	WE WERE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT LOGISTICAL THINGS FOR WORK, OR WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS OR POP CULTURE ON THE PODCAST.
POD1000000024_S0000157	YOU KNOW, THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT REALLY UNDERPINNED OUR RELATIONSHIP IN THE BEGINNING JUST WEREN'T HAPPENING ANYMORE WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY.
POD1000000024_S0000158	I KNEW THAT WE WEREN'T DOING WELL, BUT I KNEW THAT YOU DIDN'T HATE ME.
POD1000000024_S0000159	THE THING THAT WAS HARD ABOUT OUR CONFLICT IS THAT WE LOVED EACH OTHER, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.
POD1000000024_S0000160	I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THE WORDS WERE THAT YOU SAID IN THAT CONVERSATION, BUT I JUST REMEMBER THE RELIEF I FELT WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.
POD1000000024_S0000161	I FEEL AWFUL, I THINK IS WHAT I FEEL.
POD1000000024_S0000163	THANK YOU, MAN.
POD1000000024_S0000166	SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SCARY MOMENT.
POD1000000024_S0000167	SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE, OH NO, AND INSTEAD IT WAS LIKE, THANK GOD, FINALLY, LIKE IT'S ALL ON THE TABLE.
POD1000000024_S0000168	AND I REMEMBER JUST FEELING THIS HUGE SENSE OF RELIEF OF GREAT, WE ARE HAVING A BREAKDOWN AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I LOVE IT.
POD1000000024_S0000169	AND SO THAT'S HOW WE ENDED UP AT COUPLES THERAPY.
POD1000000024_S0000170	DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD TO LAUGH ABOUT THIS NOW?
POD1000000024_S0000171	LIKE, OOH, EXPENSIVE. EVERY LAUGH IS THE SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF THERAPY DOLLARS.
POD1000000024_S0000173	WE WOULD LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, RECORD THE PODCAST AND THEN, YOU KNOW, LIKE HANG UP THAT EQUIPMENT AND BE LIKE, WELL, ARE YOU READY TO GO TO DR. SO AND SO LATER?
POD1000000024_S0000174	SHOW UP TO THERAPY, DO THAT REALLY HARD WORK, AND ALSO SOMETIMES LIKE AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THE THERAPIST AND BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT IT.
POD1000000024_S0000175	THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THAT FELT LIKE SUCH AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE TO ME WHERE I WAS LIKE, AM I REALLY THIS GROWN UP?
POD1000000024_S0000176	WHO LIKE, I WORKED WITH THIS PERSON, WE ARE NOW AT OUR THERAPIST, AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO HOME AND LAY ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE THIS WAS SO HARD.
POD1000000024_S0000177	IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN AT THOSE THERAPY SESSIONS WITH ME, I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT HAD HAPPENED.
POD1000000024_S0000178	BUT IT DID HAPPEN, AND SOMEHOW WE DID IT.
POD1000000024_S0000179	RIGHT. WE BOTH STILL WANTED TO BE THERE.
POD1000000024_S0000180	AND LIKE, I THINK ABOUT THAT SAYING ABOUT LIKE, HOW DO YOU STAY MARRIED? YOU JUST DON'T GET DIVORCED OR WHATEVER. I DON'T KNOW.
POD1000000024_S0000181	BUT I WILL SAY THAT, LIKE, WE WERE BOTH CONTINUING TO SHOW UP.
POD1000000024_S0000182	IN OUR FRIENDSHIP, I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT BEING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T RUN AWAY FROM THEIR COMMITMENTS.
POD1000000024_S0000183	WE FELT LIKE THIS EXPERIENCE WE HAD HAD TRYING TO REPAIR AN INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD LIKE HIT THE ROCKS IS NOT SOMETHING WE SAW REFLECTED ANYWHERE.
POD1000000024_S0000184	AND SO THERE WAS A MOTIVATION, I THINK, TO TRY TO PUT SOME OF THIS DOWN IN WORDS.
POD1000000024_S0000185	I THINK WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT WRITING A BOOK PROPOSAL IN MAYBE 2017. DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?
POD1000000024_S0000186	YEAH, WHEN IT CAME TO AUDIO, NEITHER OF US KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING. AND IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE, OKAY, GREAT, LIKE, WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH.
POD1000000024_S0000187	AND WITH THIS, YOU KNOW, ANNE IS A WRITER.
POD1000000024_S0000188	AND I'M HER FRIEND BUT I'M ALSO HER FAN.
POD1000000024_S0000189	LIKE I'VE READ ANNE FOR YEARS.
POD1000000024_S0000190	AND SO I WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT LIKE, HOW IS THIS COLLABORATION GOING TO WORK?
POD1000000024_S0000191	WE SOLD THIS BOOK AS LIKE WE HEARD TWO QUOTE EQUAL AUTHORS AND I WAS LIKE GREAT.
POD1000000024_S0000192	I'M LIKE PAIRED UP WITH AN OLYMPIAN AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO HURDLES.
POD1000000024_S0000194	YOU KNOW, A LOT OF BOOKS THAT ARE CO WRITTEN
POD1000000024_S0000195	YOU KNOW, IN THIS 50 50 WAY HAVE, YOU KNOW, CHAPTER ONES BY ONE PERSON AND THEN CHAPTER TWOS BY THE OTHER PERSON AND THEY KIND OF VOLLEY BACK AND FORTH.
POD1000000024_S0000196	AND WE MADE A CHOICE PRETTY EARLY ON THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE ONE NARRATIVE.
POD1000000024_S0000197	AND SO AS A PROJECT, IT IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISENTANGLE OUR VARIOUS INPUTS.
POD1000000024_S0000198	AND I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL LIKE THAT FEELS TRUER TO ME IN THE SENSE OF LIKE, THAT'S REALLY WHAT A FRIENDSHIP FEELS LIKE.
POD1000000024_S0000199	AND THE WAY WE DID THAT IS WE OUTLINED TOGETHER QUITE METICULOUSLY, AND THEN WE WOULD TAKE A SECTION OF THE OUTLINE, SPLIT UP,
POD1000000024_S0000200	WE'D EACH WRITE NARRATIVELY THAT SECTION OF THE OUTLINE ON OUR SEPARATE COMPUTERS, AND THEN WE WOULD EACH READ ALOUD WHAT WE HAD WRITTEN TO THE OTHER.
POD1000000024_S0000201	AND THEN WE WOULD KNIT THEM TOGETHER AND KEEP THE BEST PARTS OF BOTH AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION OF THE OUTLINE FOR 70,000 WORDS.
POD1000000024_S0000202	WOW
POD1000000024_S0000203	CAN YOU BELIEVE WE DID THAT?
POD1000000024_S0000204	I'M JUST LIKE SAYING THAT OUT LOUD IS WILD.
POD1000000024_S0000206	MY TRULY LIKE FAVORITE MOMENTS OF OUR WRITING PROCESS IS WHEN I WOULD BE FRUSTRATED OR READY TO GIVE UP AND I WOULD LOOK AROUND
POD1000000024_S0000207	AND YOU WERE TYPING AWAY FURIOUSLY WITH YOUR SIGNATURE ANN FRIEDMAN TYPING NOISES AND EXCLAIM OUT LOUD, I LOVE WORDS. THOSE WERE THE MOMENTS.
POD1000000024_S0000208	I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE OUTING ME LIKE THIS.
POD1000000024_S0000209	I AM OUTING YOU. YOU ARE A CAPRICORN WRITER AND IT IS DISGUSTING TO BE A PART OF, BUT ALSO IT'S, YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE, WE GOT, WE DID IT.
POD1000000024_S0000210	MY FAVORITE MOMENTS ARE HEARING YOU FROM LIKE THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE BE LIKE, OKAY, OKAY.
POD1000000024_S0000212	LIKE WHERE I COULD TELL YOU WERE REALLY WORKING THROUGH SOMETHING.
POD1000000024_S0000213	LIKE YOU HAD REALLY HAD A BREAKTHROUGH.

POD1000000024_S0000234	FROM PRX.
POD1000000026_S0000000	I WAS LIKE MIKE I REALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER.
POD1000000026_S0000001	AND I JUST REMEMBER HIS RESPONSE. HE'S LIKE, COUNT ME INTERESTED.
POD1000000026_S0000002	AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PROPOSED TO YOUR WIFE, BUT WHEN YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU, IF SHE HAD COME BACK AND SAID, COUNT ME INTERESTED.
POD1000000026_S0000004	WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN LIKE, THAT WAS A YES?
POD1000000026_S0000005	I MEAN COME ON
POD1000000026_S0000006	I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION.
POD1000000026_S0000008	I'M MIKE KRIEGER, I WAS CO FOUNDER AND FORMER CTO OF INSTAGRAM.
POD1000000026_S0000009	I'M KEVIN SYSTROM, FORMER CEO AND CO FOUNDER OF INSTAGRAM.
POD1000000026_S0000011	KEVIN SYSTROM AND MIKE KRIEGER CO FOUNDED INSTAGRAM IN 2010.
POD1000000026_S0000012	A YEAR AND A HALF LATER, THEY SOLD IT TO FACEBOOK FOR A BILLION DOLLARS.
POD1000000026_S0000013	THEY STAYED ON TO RUN THE COMPANY FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS.
POD1000000026_S0000014	AND THEN, IN 2018, THEY LEFT. TOGETHER.
POD1000000026_S0000015	AND EVEN NOW, THEY STILL WORK TOGETHER.
POD1000000026_S0000016	THE FIRST TIME THEY MET, THOUGH, THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO SOMETHING SO MEANINGFUL.
POD1000000026_S0000017	IN FACT, KEVIN DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT FIRST TIME THEY MET.
POD1000000026_S0000019	I'D LIKE TO SAY I DO. I REALLY DON'T.
POD1000000026_S0000020	THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER MEETING MIKE WAS IN A COFFEE BAR, THIS SMALL CAFE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
POD1000000026_S0000021	IT BECAME MY GO TO OFFICE BECAUSE I HAD LEFT MY JOB AND I WAS WORKING ON THIS APP CALLED BOURBON.
POD1000000026_S0000022	AND IT WAS JUST ME.
POD1000000026_S0000023	I KNEW OF MIKE, I HAD SEEN HIM, LIKE, WE'RE IN THE SAME CIRCLES.
POD1000000026_S0000024	AND I RECOGNIZED MIKE AND I WALKED OVER TO SAY HELLO.
POD1000000026_S0000025	BUT THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THE THING HE WAS WORKING ON.
POD1000000026_S0000026	THERE'S LIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE.
POD1000000026_S0000027	AND I DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS WORKING WITH A DESIGNER.
POD1000000026_S0000028	SO ANYWAY, IN MY MIND, MIKE WAS LIKE THIS AMAZING DESIGNER.
POD1000000026_S0000029	LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT ACTUALLY HE WAS AN AMAZING ENGINEER.
POD1000000026_S0000031	I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'VE EVER TOUCHED PHOTOSHOP ACTUALLY.
POD1000000026_S0000033	ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
POD1000000026_S0000034	I BUILT THE SHUTTER ON THE VERY FIRST VERSION OF INSTAGRAM AND IT WAS VERY BASIC.
POD1000000026_S0000035	WASN'T THE SHUTTER LITERALLY JUST TWO GRAY SLIDERS THAT JUST CLOSED AND OPENED?
POD1000000026_S0000036	THAT'S IT.
POD1000000026_S0000038	THAT WAS NOT, THAT WAS NOT THAT GOOD, HONESTLY.
POD1000000026_S0000040	BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER HANGING OUT WITH YOU. CAUSE I REMEMBER BEING SO IMPRESSED.
POD1000000026_S0000041	AND I ASKED YOU WHAT TOOL YOU WERE USING.
POD1000000026_S0000042	AND I DON'T REMEMBER THE TOOL, BUT I REMEMBER USING IT AND JUST BEING LIKE, OH MAN, LIKE.
POD1000000026_S0000043	IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE LIKE A MIC IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU CAN ASK THEM A QUESTION AND THEY JUST ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST ANSWER.
POD1000000026_S0000044	AND IT TURNS OUT YEARS LATER, I STILL FEEL LIKE THAT'S TRUE.
POD1000000026_S0000045	I REMEMBER THINKING, OH, HERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY LIKE PURSUING SOMETHING THAT HE'S EXCITED ABOUT.
POD1000000026_S0000046	ACTUALLY BUILDING IT AND LIKE, OH, A KINDRED SPIRIT THAT'S HERE ON THE WEEKENDS, NOT JUST TO CHECK FACEBOOK OR DO SOMETHING, BUT IS BUILDING.
POD1000000026_S0000047	SO HAVING ANOTHER BUILDER WAS EXCITING. I'M LIKE, OH, SOMEBODY ELSE CARES ABOUT THIS STUFF.
POD1000000026_S0000048	I THINK MAYBE WHERE MIKE AND I OVERLAP MOST IS THE FACT THAT WE BOTH LOVE TO MAKE THINGS.
POD1000000026_S0000049	MY DREAM WAS ALWAYS TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE USED.
POD1000000026_S0000050	SO OUR FRIENDSHIP REVOLVES AROUND THAT.
POD1000000026_S0000051	AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSION.
POD1000000026_S0000052	I DID KNOW THAT HE WAS WORKING ON BOURBON.
POD1000000026_S0000053	I THINK I ALREADY HAD MAYBE INSTALLED IT AND WAS PLAYING AROUND WITH IT.
POD1000000026_S0000054	IT WAS A CHECK IN APP THAT LET YOU CHECK IN AT DIFFERENT PLACES.
POD1000000026_S0000055	IT WAS A WAY OF SHARING WHAT YOU WERE UP TO AND WHERE YOU WERE.
POD1000000026_S0000056	WITH THE TWIST THAT YOU COULD ADD PHOTOS AND VIDEOS TO IT, WHICH IN 2009 WAS ACTUALLY THE ONLY ONE I COULD FIND THAT COULD DO THAT.
POD1000000026_S0000057	AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD TO JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS TO UPLOAD A PHOTO ON BOURBON,
POD1000000026_S0000058	PEOPLE WERE DOING IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WASN'T JUST THIS PERSON IS HERE BUT OH THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE.
POD1000000026_S0000059	SO THAT WAS TO ME THE INKLING OF SOMETHING INTERESTING IN VERBIN.
POD1000000026_S0000060	I WAS PITCHING IT TO INVESTORS AND ONE OF THE INVESTORS WAS LIKE, YEAH, HERE'S 50 GRAND.
POD1000000026_S0000061	YOU CAN GO WORK ON THIS AND LIKE TAKE A SMALL, SMALL STIPEND.
POD1000000026_S0000062	BUT YOU HAVE TO GET A CO FOUNDER. THESE THINGS WORK BEST WHEN YOU HAVE A CO FOUNDER.
POD1000000026_S0000063	HE WAS SAYING, HEY, LOOK AT ALL THE BEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.
POD1000000026_S0000064	THE ONES THAT REALLY WORK ARE THE ONES WHERE GENERALLY THERE'S MORE THAN ONE SOLO PERSON RUNNING THE SHIP.
POD1000000026_S0000065	GOOGLE WAS A CO FOUNDER PAIR.
POD1000000026_S0000066	YOUTUBE WAS A CO FOUNDER PAIR.
POD1000000026_S0000067	THE POINT IS WHEN YOU HAVE A TEAM, YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED.
POD1000000026_S0000068	I AGREED WITH THAT. I MEAN, THE PATTERN WAS CLEARLY THERE. THE EVIDENCE WAS THERE.
POD1000000026_S0000069	SO, I KIND OF WENT THROUGH THE ROLODEX IN MY MIND OF LIKE, WHO DO I KNOW THAT COULD BE A CO FOUNDER?
POD1000000026_S0000070	AND I REMEMBER RUNNING INTO MIKE. AND I THINK THE NEXT TIME I RAN INTO HIM, I FLOATED THE IDEA, HEY, LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THIS.
POD1000000026_S0000071	WE BASICALLY DECIDED WE'RE GONNA PROTOTYPE WORKING TOGETHER.
POD1000000026_S0000072	SO WE WOULD GET TOGETHER AT A CAFE NEAR MIKE'S HOUSE AND WE CREATED A FAKE PROJECT.
POD1000000026_S0000073	WHY WE DIDN'T JUST WORK ON BOURBON, I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE CREATED A FAKE PROJECT WITH A FAKE OUTCOME WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT NIGHT.
POD1000000026_S0000074	MIKE WOULD DO ONE HALF OF IT, I'D DO A DIFFERENT HALF OF IT, AND WE'D COME TOGETHER AND WE'D ASK QUESTIONS, FIGURE OUT HOW EACH OTHER WORKED.
POD1000000026_S0000075	AND WE REALLY ENJOYED THAT EXPERIENCE.
POD1000000026_S0000076	SO, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER THIS FATEFUL DAY STANDING AT THE CALTRAIN STATION BEFORE MIKE HAD TO GO TO WORK AND...
POD1000000026_S0000077	I WAS LIKE, MIKE, I REALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER.
POD1000000026_S0000078	IN MY HEAD, I WAS PROBABLY LIKE, I REALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND I REALLY NEED THIS $50,000, RIGHT? SO I NEED A CO FOUNDER TOO.
POD1000000026_S0000079	AND I ASKED HIM THIS QUESTION AND I JUST REMEMBER HIS RESPONSE. HE'S LIKE, COUNT ME INTERESTED.
POD1000000026_S0000081	COUNT ME INTERESTED. ARE YOU IN OR ARE YOU OUT?
POD1000000026_S0000082	I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE MOMENT HE ASKED BECAUSE I HAD ONE OF THOSE LIFE FLASHING BEFORE YOUR EYES, BUT NOT THE PAST THE FUTURE
POD1000000026_S0000083	I WAS LIKE, OKAY, I CAN BE WORKING WITH SOMEBODY WHO I HAVE COME TO REALLY START RESPECTING AND LIKE WANT TO WORK WITH.
POD1000000026_S0000084	AND THAT'S WHERE COUNT ME INTERESTED CAME FROM WHICH TO ME SOUNDED LIKE A YES, BUT MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE COY
POD1000000026_S0000085	BUT TO ME, IT WAS JUST LIKE, OH YEAH, OF COURSE.
POD1000000026_S0000086	I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION, OKAY?
POD1000000026_S0000087	I WANT A LITTLE BIT OF
POD1000000026_S0000088	UNDERSTANDING HERE.
POD1000000026_S0000089	YOU'RE NOW MARRIED.
POD1000000026_S0000090	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PROPOSED TO YOUR WIFE, BUT WHEN YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU, IF SHE HAD COME BACK AND SAID, COUNT ME INTERESTED.
POD1000000026_S0000091	WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN LIKE, THAT WAS A YES?
POD1000000026_S0000093	THAT'S FOR CLARIFICATION.
POD1000000026_S0000095	I LOOK BACK ON A LOT OF THE MAJOR DECISIONS IN MY LIFE THAT I'VE MADE.
POD1000000026_S0000096	THIS ONE IS AN EASIER ONE WHERE I KNEW THAT IT WAS WHAT I WANTED TO DO AND THEN THE NEXT WEEK WAS LOGISTICALLY CAN I DO IT?
POD1000000026_S0000097	YOU KNOW, I COME FROM BRAZIL, I WAS ON A WORK VISA.
POD1000000026_S0000098	YOU WERE TAKING ON SO MUCH RISK BECAUSE YOU HAD EVERYTHING SET.
POD1000000026_S0000099	THEY GIVE YOU A JOB, YOU HAVE THIS WORK VISA, EVERYTHING.
POD1000000026_S0000100	AND YOU WERE JUMPING AND LIKE, I THINK BACK HOW CRAZY WE WERE TO DO THAT.
POD1000000026_S0000101	WE HAD TO LIKE FORM A COMPANY SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE LIKE, OKAY, YOU CAN HAVE THIS VISA.
POD1000000026_S0000102	I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST MOMENT WHERE I REALLY STARTED FEELING THIS SORT OF MUTUAL TRUST WITH KEVIN.
POD1000000026_S0000103	BECAUSE THE COUNT ME INTERESTED MOMENT WAS JANUARY AND WE APPLIED SOON AFTERWARDS.
POD1000000026_S0000104	AND 80 DAYS GOES BY, 90 DAYS GOES BY.
POD1000000026_S0000105	AND I WAS LIKE KEV, LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET THIS OFF THE GROUND.
POD1000000026_S0000106	IT'S LIKE MARCH, IT'S APRIL NOW, LIKE...
POD1000000026_S0000107	THREE MONTHS IS FOREVER IN STARTUP LAND LIKE IF YOU WANT TO CUT THIS AND BE LIKE I'M JUST GONNA FIND A US CO FOUNDER THAT CAN MAKE THIS WORK. I'LL GET IT
POD1000000026_S0000108	AND I REMEMBER KEVIN WAS LIKE, NO MAN, LIKE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS WORK.
POD1000000026_S0000109	LET'S EMAIL THE LAWYER, LET'S KEEP PUSHING FORWARD, LIKE, NO, WE'LL WAIT, WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.
POD1000000026_S0000110	THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.
POD1000000026_S0000111	I MEAN, IT STILL DOES, LIKE, BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN LIKE, YEAH, MAN, THIS IS TOO HARD. I NEED TO GET THIS GOING.
POD1000000026_S0000112	AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RATIONAL DECISION TO HAVE MADE.
POD1000000026_S0000113	BUT INSTEAD HE WAS LIKE, NO, LET'S LIKE FIGURE THIS OUT AND...
POD1000000026_S0000114	IT FINALLY CAME AND AT THAT POINT IT WAS LIKE, ALRIGHT, I CAN ACTUALLY JOIN AND ACTUALLY DO THIS STUFF TOGETHER.
POD1000000026_S0000115	WE HAD BEEN WORKING ON BOURBON FOR A WHILE, EIGHT, NINE MONTHS OR SOMETHING BY THAT TIME.
POD1000000026_S0000116	AND WE WERE MEETING ONE OF OUR EARLY INVESTORS.
POD1000000026_S0000117	AND HE WAS LIKE, SO WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING? WHAT'S UP? LIKE WHAT'S NEW?
POD1000000026_S0000118	AND WE'RE LIKE, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THESE FEATURES AND IT DOES THIS THING AND IT DOES THIS THING.
POD1000000026_S0000119	AND HIS FACE WAS JUST BLANK.
POD1000000026_S0000120	LIKE HE'S JUST LOOKING AT US LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD.
POD1000000026_S0000121	AND WE WERE SO SAD AFTER THAT MEETING BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLEAR TO US THAT WE COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT WE WERE WORKING ON.
POD1000000026_S0000122	SO WE WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE, WE SAT IN FRONT OF A WHITEBOARD AND WE SAID, OKAY, WE HAVE TO FOCUS THIS THING.
POD1000000026_S0000123	IT'S TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH ALL AT ONCE.
POD1000000026_S0000124	SO WE STRIPPED EVERYTHING AWAY THAT DAY.
POD1000000026_S0000125	AND WE FOCUSED JUST ON THE COMPONENTS THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY BECOME INSTAGRAM.
POD1000000026_S0000126	AND MAYBE IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK OR TWO, MADE THE FIRST VERSION OF INSTAGRAM.
POD1000000026_S0000127	I SPENT FAR MORE TIME WITH KEVIN THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING FOR THAT FIRST YEAR OF INSTAGRAM, EASILY, RIGHT? LIKE WE WERE IN THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY.
POD1000000026_S0000128	12, 13, 14 HOURS, SOMETIMES OVERNIGHT.
POD1000000026_S0000129	YOU KNOW, MIKE WOULD BE BRUSHING HIS TEETH IN THE EMPLOYEE BATHROOM, YOU KNOW, AT 4AM JUST BECAUSE LIKE WE HAD BEEN THERE ALL NIGHT.
POD1000000026_S0000130	WE GOT TO LAUNCH DAY, WE LAUNCHED IT TO THE WORLD.
POD1000000026_S0000131	OCTOBER 6, 2010. I KNOW THAT DATE AND THE DATE OF MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTH. THOSE ARE THE TWO DATES I WILL NEVER FORGET, RIGHT?
POD1000000026_S0000132	PEOPLE LIKED IT. PEOPLE STARTED USING IT.
POD1000000026_S0000133	AND I WAS TAKEN ABACK BECAUSE I MEAN, I HAD WORKED AT A COMPANY BEFORE THAT STRUGGLED TO GET 10,000 PEOPLE TO USE IT OVER A YEAR.
POD1000000026_S0000134	AND WE GOT TO 25,000 THAT FIRST DAY.
POD1000000026_S0000135	AND I REMEMBER TURNING TO MIKE AND I SAID, I THINK WE'VE CREATED SOMETHING.
POD1000000026_S0000136	I'M USUALLY THE PESSIMIST AND MIKE IS USUALLY, I'M NOT SURE, OPTIMIST, BUT YOU'RE PRAGMATIST, RIGHT?
POD1000000026_S0000137	BUT LIKE I HAD THIS MOMENT OF CLARITY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN PEOPLE REACT THIS WAY.
POD1000000026_S0000138	AND MIKE JUST LOOKED AT ME LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE NOT. MAYBE THIS IS ALL GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN.
POD1000000026_S0000139	THE ONE LITTLE DINKY SERVER THAT WE HAD WAS JUST LIKE METAPHORICALLY AND PERHAPS PHYSICALLY MELTING BY ALL THE TRAFFIC THAT WAS COMING AT IT.
POD1000000026_S0000140	I REALLY FELT LIKE WE HAD SQUANDERED THIS OPPORTUNITY.
POD1000000026_S0000141	AND I WAS LIKE, WE SHOULD PROBABLY ADD ANOTHER SERVER.
POD1000000026_S0000142	AND KEVIN WAS LIKE, NO, WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER SERVER.
POD1000000026_S0000143	AND IN RETROSPECT, I THINK IT WAS LIKE, WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS THING WAS GOING TO TAKE OFF AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE TO ADD ANOTHER SERVER. LIKE, DID WE REALLY NEED IT?
POD1000000026_S0000144	AND I WAS LIKE, NO, I THINK WE DO.
POD1000000026_S0000145	AND THEN LIKE LATER HE'S LIKE, OH MAN, SORRY, LIKE I WAS A LITTLE HEATED
POD1000000026_S0000146	YOU KNOW, WE HAD BEEN UP FOR 36 HOURS AT THAT POINT, YOU KNOW, KIND OF FIGHTING OFF SLEEP AND ALSO EXCITED.
POD1000000026_S0000148	BOTH THE BEST AND WORST DAYS OF OUR LIVES.
POD1000000026_S0000149	LIKE YOU KNOW THE THING WAS WORKING BUT ALSO WAS CRASHING.
POD1000000026_S0000150	I THINK THAT WAS LIKE THE ONLY TIME WE'VE EVER RAISED OUR VOICES WITH EACH OTHER.
POD1000000026_S0000151	IT WAS BRIEF. IT WAS LIKE A PROBABLY 30 SECOND INTERACTION.
POD1000000026_S0000152	I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
POD1000000026_S0000154	WHICH IS TRUE, LIKE THAT WAS THE ONE TIME THAT IT WAS HEATED AND IT WAS JUST THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT.
POD1000000026_S0000155	I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE IT WAY BACK AT OUR FIRST DISAGREEMENT, WHICH ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN MANY YEARS.
POD1000000026_S0000156	TWO OR THREE WEEKS INTO WORKING TOGETHER. I REMEMBER COMING IN ONE DAY AND SAYING,
POD1000000026_S0000157	WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US LIKE ONE OR TWO DAYS A WEEK JUST WORKING FROM HOME BECAUSE I CAN JUST JAM ON STUFF AND JUST STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND CODE AND I'LL LIKE BE UP TILL NOON.
POD1000000026_S0000158	AND IT'LL LIKE, I THINK I'LL WORK BETTER THAT WAY. AND YOU'RE LIKE.
POD1000000026_S0000159	NO, I'D REALLY LIKE FOR US TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE TOGETHER. I THINK THAT MATTERS A LOT.
POD1000000026_S0000160	AND I REMEMBER BEING ANNOYED FOR LIKE 10 SECONDS
POD1000000026_S0000162	I WAS LIKE, YEAH, OKAY, LIKE, SURE, LIKE, WE'D GIVE THAT A TRY.
POD1000000026_S0000163	AND IN THE END, IT WAS GREAT. WE WERE ABLE TO JAM ON IDEAS AND MOVE REALLY QUICKLY.
POD1000000026_S0000164	IF I HAD TO LIKE ABSTRACT IT AND WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT WORKING WITH KEVIN OVER THE YEARS IT WAS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER A PERSON THAT WILL JUST AGREE TO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPY.
POD1000000026_S0000165	BUT YOU ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IN DISAGREEING YOU'RE ALSO NOT BEING A JERK AND MAKING THEM FEEL BAD ABOUT FEELING DIFFERENTLY. YOU'RE LIKE,
POD1000000026_S0000166	NOW I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AND HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR IT.
POD1000000026_S0000167	IS THERE LIKE A REASON WHY YOU REALLY FEEL DIFFERENTLY AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION?
POD1000000026_S0000168	THAT SORT OF LIKE DETOXIFIED ABILITY TO DISAGREE IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
POD1000000026_S0000169	I GET ANNOYED REALLY EASILY.
POD1000000026_S0000170	BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS MIKE DOESN'T ANNOY ME. LIKE HE REALLY DOESN'T.
POD1000000026_S0000171	LIKE, I REALLY DON'T GET ANNOYED WITH MIKE BECAUSE HE HAS CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY.
POD1000000026_S0000172	THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS I CARE ABOUT.
POD1000000026_S0000173	LIKE IF YOU'RE JUST A GENERALLY GOOD PERSON AND WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING, YOU DO IT.
POD1000000026_S0000174	WHO CARES IF MIKE CHOSE THE WRONG X, Y, OR Z TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OR MAYBE INTRODUCED A BUG OR WHAT? I DON'T CARE.
POD1000000026_S0000175	MIKE HAS NEVER MADE EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE TIME ON THE SERVER ISSUE. MIKE HAS NEVER MADE ME ANGRY.
POD1000000026_S0000176	I DON'T THINK WE EVER ACTUALLY HAD TITLES FOR THE LONGEST TIME.
POD1000000026_S0000177	I GUESS ONCE WE STARTED DOING PUBLIC EVENTS AND WE HAD TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR TITLES WERE
POD1000000026_S0000178	THERE WAS A TIME WHERE WE WERE LIKE, OKAY, YOU'RE CTO, I'M CEO. WE KIND OF LIKE DIVIDED IT THAT WAY.
POD1000000026_S0000179	BUT YOU ALWAYS SAY CO FOUNDER FIRST. THAT'S THE TITLE.
POD1000000026_S0000180	WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT MY IDENTITY AND WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE COMPANY, I WAS LIKE, CO FOUNDER, MAYBE TECHNICAL CO FOUNDER IF YOU WANTED TO PUT AN ADJECTIVE IN FRONT OF IT.
POD1000000026_S0000181	REQUIRED TECHNICAL CO FOUNDERS.
POD1000000026_S0000184	BUT I DO ALSO THINK THE SPEAKSTAR PERSONALITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP, IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANY COMPANY TO ULTIMATELY HAVE ONE FINAL DECISION MAKER.
POD1000000026_S0000185	I'VE SEEN SO MANY COMPANIES NOT HAVE ONE AND IT BECOME A MESS. SOMETIMES THERE'S A TIE BREAK NEEDED OR SOMETIMES LIKE A CALL NEEDS TO GET MADE.
POD1000000026_S0000186	YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING TO LIKE MAKE THAT CALL AND YOU ALL HAVE TO BE READY TO LIKE MAKE THAT PERSON SUCCESSFUL IN THAT ROLE OR ELSE IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK.
POD1000000026_S0000187	WE HAD A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY WANTED INSTAGRAM INSIDE OF THEIR COMPANY.
POD1000000026_S0000188	BUT WE WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN DOING OUR OWN THING THAT WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE PART OF ANY OTHER COMPANY.
POD1000000026_S0000189	WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A WING OF A BUILDING. WE WANTED TO BE THE BUILDING.
POD1000000026_S0000190	AND I REMEMBER YOU TURNED TO ME AT ONE POINT AND YOU'RE LIKE, I REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PURSUE ANY OF THESE.
POD1000000026_S0000191	LIKE I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF INDEPENDENT BUT IF YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY LIKE LET ME KNOW LIKE LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION
POD1000000026_S0000192	WHICH WAS HELPFUL BECAUSE IT MADE ME REFLECT AND BE LIKE, NO, NO, THIS IS REALLY FUN.
POD1000000026_S0000193	LIKE I'M WORKING WITH SOMEBODY I DEEPLY RESPECT. WE'RE STARTING TO BUILD A TEAM. IT'S WORKING.
POD1000000026_S0000194	YEAH, LET'S LIKE, LET'S KEEP DOING THIS THING. WE STILL GOT MONEY IN THE BANK.
POD1000000026_S0000195	SO, YOU KNOW, FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE WERE JUST LIKE, WE'RE GONNA DO THIS THING OURSELVES.
POD1000000026_S0000196	AND THE ONLY TIME WE LITERALLY HAD LIKE A NUMBER TO FACE WAS THE FACEBOOK OFFER.
POD1000000026_S0000197	WHEN WE WERE LIKE, OH, A BILLION DOLLARS JUST SOUNDS FUNNY TO SAY, RIGHT? LIKE.
POD1000000026_S0000198	IT'S A BILLION, YOU THINK OF LIKE DR. EVIL IN ONE OF THESE MOVIES, RIGHT?
POD1000000026_S0000199	BUT SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND OFFERS YOU A BILLION DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR, I DON'T KNOW, ALL OF A YEAR PUBLICLY, AND THEN YOU'VE GOT 11 EMPLOYEES AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE, MAN, I'D LIKE, HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT CALCULUS?
POD1000000026_S0000200	WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
POD1000000026_S0000201	I REALLY REMEMBER BEING IN SORT OF LIKE A DAZE. IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING WAS JUST VERY STRANGE.
POD1000000026_S0000202	WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.
POD1000000026_S0000203	AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE THING THAT MATTERED THE MOST TO US WAS THAT THEY WANTED US TO KEEP RUNNING IT INDEPENDENTLY, LIKE WE HAD BEEN DOING.
POD1000000026_S0000204	THEY WERE LIKE, NO, INSTAGRAM'S A THING.
POD1000000026_S0000205	YOUR COMMUNITY, YOU GUYS HAVE EFFECTIVELY A TEAM AND A COMPANY AND A CULTURE.
POD1000000026_S0000206	KEEP DOING THAT.
POD1000000026_S0000207	AND WE STAYED SIX YEARS?
POD1000000026_S0000208	THERE WAS A LOT OF LIKE, HEY, CHECKING IN. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
POD1000000026_S0000209	WE ONLY WANTED TO BE AT INSTAGRAM IF THE OTHER PERSON WAS AT INSTAGRAM.
POD1000000026_S0000210	EVERY JANUARY I WOULD DECIDE I WANTED TO CONSCIOUSLY RECOMMIT TO STILL BEING THERE.
POD1000000026_S0000211	MAKE IT AN INTENTIONAL CHOICE.
POD1000000026_S0000212	LIKE I COME AROUND IN JANUARY AND I SAY, IS THIS STILL WHAT I WANT TO BE LEARNING?
POD1000000026_S0000213	I VOWED TO MYSELF. IT'S FUNNY THE VOWS YOU MAKE TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE 18 YEARS OLD
POD1000000026_S0000214	I VOWED TO MYSELF WHEN I WAS 18, I WANTED TO HAVE A LIFE FULL OF UNIQUE YEARS, NOT THE SAME YEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
POD1000000026_S0000215	LIKE THAT WAS MY BIGGEST FEAR.
POD1000000026_S0000216	AND I LOOKED AND I WAS LIKE, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE DONE INCREDIBLY HARD THINGS.
POD1000000026_S0000217	I'VE LEARNED A TON, BUT IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE ON SOME LIKE DIMINISHING RETURNS CURVE OF LEARNING.
POD1000000026_S0000218	AND I REMEMBER I HAD DINNER WITH KEVIN, I WAS LIKE, HEY MAN, I FEEL LIKE IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ME TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WHICH IS LIKE A HARD CONVERSATION, LIKE IT'S A SCARY CONVERSATION TO HAVE.
POD1000000026_S0000219	I REMEMBER KEVIN TURNED TO ME AND SAID, LIKE, I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.
POD1000000026_S0000220	IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK WOULD STILL FEEL LIKE A NEW INTERESTING THING?
POD1000000026_S0000221	AND I LISTED A COUPLE OF THINGS.
POD1000000026_S0000222	AND THEN I HAD THE INTERESTING EXPERIENCE OF KIND OF DOING PART OF KEVIN'S JOB FOR A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE HE WENT OUT ON PATERNITY LEAVE.
POD1000000026_S0000223	AND HE WAS OUT AND HE SAID, MIKE, I'M ON PATERNITY LEAVE. I REALLY WANT TO BE PRESENT WITH MY KID.
POD1000000026_S0000224	CAN YOU MAKE SURE THINGS GO WELL WHILE I'M AWAY?
POD1000000026_S0000225	AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IN MY HEAD I ALWAYS HAD THIS QUESTION LIKE, IS THE ONE THING THAT WOULD MAKE ME STAY LIKE TO HAVE THIS VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF BEING CEO RATHER THAN CTO?
POD1000000026_S0000226	AND I GOT TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE FOR LIKE TWO MONTHS.
POD1000000026_S0000227	I REMEMBER KEVIN HITTING BACK. I WAS LIKE, KEVIN, I DO NOT WANT YOUR JOB AT ALL.
POD1000000026_S0000228	AND LIKE WE'D ALWAYS JOKE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WE WORK TOGETHER IS THAT WE DIDN'T WANT EACH OTHER'S JOBS
POD1000000026_S0000229	AND AT SOME POINT IT FELT LIKE A THING I'D ALWAYS SAID AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY TRUE.
POD1000000026_S0000230	BUT I REMEMBER AT THE END OF THE EXPERIENCE BEING LIKE, NO, I'M REALLY GLAD I GOT TO TRY IT BECAUSE MADE ME REALIZE LIKE WHERE MY HAPPY SPOT IS IS NOT IN THAT ROLE.
POD1000000026_S0000231	IN THE ROLE I WAS IN AND IN THAT ROLE I FEEL LIKE I'VE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH.
POD1000000026_S0000232	AND I WANTED SOMETHING HARD.
POD1000000026_S0000233	AND I WANTED TO BE BAD AT SOMETHING AGAIN.
POD1000000026_S0000234	MAYBE WON'T BE AS BIG AS INSTAGRAM MAYBE ONE.
POD1000000026_S0000235	PROBABLY WON'T BE AS BIG AS INSTAGRAM, LET'S BE HONEST.
POD1000000026_S0000236	BUT MAYBE IT'LL BE JUST AS FUN TO LEARN ALONG THE WAY.
POD1000000026_S0000237	THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT MADE ME WANT TO JUMP.
POD1000000026_S0000238	BUT WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO.
POD1000000026_S0000239	THE FIRST THING WAS REST AND RECOVERY.
POD1000000026_S0000240	WE WERE KIND OF OFF DOING OUR OWN THING. WE WANTED TO JUST CHILL OUT AND DISCONNECT A LITTLE BIT. BUT WE RECONNECTED AND IT WAS LIKE, YEAH, WHAT DO YOU MISS THE MOST?
POD1000000026_S0000241	IT'S LIKE, WELL, I MISS HANGING OUT, OF COURSE, AND YOU SAY THOSE NICE THINGS TO EACH OTHER, BUT I MISS BUILDING STUFF.
POD1000000026_S0000242	I LEARNED A BIG LESSON I THINK IN THE MIDDLE MONTHS BEFORE WE REALLY RECONNECTED WHICH WAS I THINK I'M HOLDING THIS IDEA OF KEVIN IN MY HEAD OF LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000243	I BET HE'S LIKE ALREADY THOUGHT OF LIKE WHAT'S NEXT AND LIKE HE HASN'T TOLD ME ABOUT IT
POD1000000026_S0000244	AND I REALIZED LIKE.
POD1000000026_S0000245	OH NO.
POD1000000026_S0000246	I CREATED THIS THING OF LIKE, OH, WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN A FEW MONTHS.
POD1000000026_S0000247	AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, BUT LIKE THAT WAS THE LONGEST WE WENT WITHOUT REALLY TALKING IN NINE YEARS.
POD1000000026_S0000248	SO LIKE.
POD1000000026_S0000250	I WAS LIKE MAN LIKE WE HAVEN'T TALKED WHICH MUST MEAN THAT LIKE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME
POD1000000026_S0000251	AND I REMEMBER HAVING THIS PHONE CALL THAT WAS SO LIKE WHAT A RELIEF LIKE WE TALKED ON THE PHONE YOU'RE LIKE YEAH LIKE I'M WHERE YOU ARE
POD1000000026_S0000252	LIKE I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF WHAT'S NEXT AND I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU. AND I WAS LIKE, I'D LOVE TO LIKE, LOVE TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU TOO.
POD1000000026_S0000253	TO ME THE LESSON LEARNED WAS LIKE, IF YOU HAVE LIKE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY AND THEN YOU JUST DON'T TALK TO THEM FOR A FEW MONTHS, LIKE
POD1000000026_S0000254	YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO START ASSUMING THAT THAT SILENCE MEANS SOMETHING THAT IT ABSOLUTELY DOESN'T.
POD1000000026_S0000255	AND IT JUST MEANT THAT WE JUST NEEDED SOME TIME TO CLEAR OUR HEADS AND HAVE OUR OWN THING.
POD1000000026_S0000256	AND ONCE HE TALKED, I WAS LIKE, OH, OK, GREAT. HE FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO, WHICH IS LIKE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YET, BUT WE WANT TO DO IT WITH EACH OTHER.
POD1000000026_S0000257	AND THAT WAS A REAL LIKE RELIEF FOR ME. I WAS LIKE, GREAT, WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AND NOW WE CAN JUST SPEND THE TIME TO EXPLORE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE EXCITED TO BUILD NEXT.
POD1000000026_S0000258	BOTH OF US WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER AGAIN.
POD1000000026_S0000259	LIKE THAT WAS RARE, LIKE MOST CO FOUNDER PAIRS FIND THEMSELVES IN SOME SORT OF FIGHT ALONG THE WAY AND BREAK UP AND
POD1000000026_S0000260	THE IDEA THAT WE COULD HAVE A NEW CHALLENGE TOGETHER POTENTIALLY, I THINK WAS WHAT MADE IT WAY MORE EXCITING.
POD1000000026_S0000261	I'M NOT SURE WE WERE LIKE LOOKING FOR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WHEN WE STARTED LIKE A FRIENDSHIP.
POD1000000026_S0000262	BUT THE BOND WE HAVE NOW IS.
POD1000000026_S0000264	I THINK I'D LIKEN TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE WERE IN THE MILITARY TOGETHER.
POD1000000026_S0000265	AND I'M NOT SAYING WE DID ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO AS IMPORTANT AS THAT. BUT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THINGS WITH SOMEONE, WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO KILL YOUR COMPANY, WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO THROW YOU UNDER THE BUS,
POD1000000026_S0000266	ALL THIS STUFF HAS HAPPENED TO US, AND THEN SOME.
POD1000000026_S0000267	AND I REMEMBER VERY SPECIFICALLY THIS MOMENT, WE WERE HAVING A DISAGREEMENT WITH AN INVESTOR.
POD1000000026_S0000268	AND WE WERE SO STRESSED OUT AND WE WENT TO THIS REALLY TERRIBLE TAQUERIA ON MARKET STREET.
POD1000000026_S0000269	BUT WE SAT DOWN AND WE BOTH ORDERED LIKE THE GREASIEST THING WE COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.
POD1000000026_S0000270	AND HONESTLY, THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOW IN THE COMPANY, BUT IT WAS A HIGH FOR ME.
POD1000000026_S0000271	LIKE, I LOOK BACK ON THAT MOMENT REALLY FONDLY BECAUSE IT WAS US AGAINST THE WORLD.
POD1000000026_S0000272	IT WAS LIKE, WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS THING. EVEN IF PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IN US, EVEN IF WE'RE HAVING THIS THING GO ON, LIKE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS WORK.
POD1000000026_S0000273	CALL IT FRIENDSHIP, BUT THAT IS LIKE A BOND THAT YOU DON'T FORM HANGING OUT.
POD1000000026_S0000274	THE FACT THAT WE STILL LIKE EACH OTHER THIS LONG I THINK SPEAKS TO LIKE A DEEPER TRUST AND LIKE REAL BOND.
POD1000000026_S0000275	BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT WE LIKED EACH OTHER AFTER THAT FIRST YEAR, WHICH IS LIKE PURE EXPOSURE, SPOKE TO TRUST, BUT I THINK ALSO JUST TO
POD1000000026_S0000276	WE HAVE A WAY ABOUT EACH OTHER THAT IS NOT ONE THAT WE FIND ANNOYING.
POD1000000026_S0000277	WHICH SOUNDS TRIVIAL, BUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU'RE THAT AROUND SOMEBODY FOR THAT LONG FOR THAT MANY DAYS.
POD1000000026_S0000278	YOU HAVEN'T SHOWERED IN THREE DAYS SOMETIMES AND YOU'RE EATING THE SAME LUNCH YOU'VE EATEN EVERY SINGLE DAY LIKE.
POD1000000026_S0000279	IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND HARD TO SCREEN FOR IN A COUPLE OF NIGHTS AT A COFFEE SHOP PROTOTYPING.
POD1000000026_S0000280	I THINK IN THAT WAS A REGARD WHERE WE PROBABLY GOT LUCKY.
POD1000000026_S0000281	COULD HAVE SAID IT BETTER. THAT'S EXACTLY IT.

POD1000000028_S0000007	ARE YOU THE TOUGHEST COACH IN THE US? WILL YOU PUT THE KIDS THROUGH HERE? IS IT MORE DEMANDING THAN MOST PLACES?
POD1000000028_S0000008	I REALLY CAN'T ANSWER THAT ONE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER PLACES.
POD1000000028_S0000010	DID THE COROLLAS HAVE GREAT SUCCESS AS COACHES? ABSOLUTELY.
POD1000000028_S0000012	MY GOD, I CAN'T EXPRESS THE FEELING
POD1000000028_S0000013	DID THEY CREATE A SYSTEM THAT ESTABLISHED THE U.S. WOMEN AS AN OVERWHELMING POWERHOUSE? MOST DEFINITELY.
POD1000000028_S0000014	AND SILVER MEDALIST FOR TEAM USA.
POD1000000028_S0000015	FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES, NO NAME HAS MEANT MORE TO WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS THAN KAROLYI. BELLA AND MARTA KAROLYI, TWO OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COACHES IN GYMNASTICS HISTORY.
POD1000000028_S0000016	RIGHT NOW WE TURN TO WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BECOME A POWER IN RECENT YEARS, NOW LOOKING TO BECOME THE POWER.
POD1000000028_S0000017	BELLA AND MARTA CAROLI GAVE THE U.S. ITS FIRST SUPERSTAR, MARY LOU RETTON, ITS FIRST GOLD MEDAL, AND EVENTUALLY PUT AMERICAN GYMNASTS ON TOP OF THE MEDAL STAND YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR.
POD1000000028_S0000019	BELLA BECAME WORLD FAMOUS AS A BIG BEAR OF A MAN, GREGARIOUS AND LOUD.
POD1000000028_S0000021	THE GUY WITH THE THICK ACCENT THAT WAS GIVING THESE BIG BEAR HUGS.
POD1000000028_S0000023	MARTA CAME ACROSS AS THE OPPOSITE OF HER HUSBAND, PETITE AND RESERVED. WHAT IS SHE LIKE?
POD1000000028_S0000024	SHE IS ACTUALLY VERY SWEET, BUT VERY TOUGH.
POD1000000028_S0000025	IF WE GAVE 100%, SHE WANTED 110. NOTHING WAS EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR MARTA, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MADE US SO GOOD.
POD1000000028_S0000027	THE KAROLIS EMBODY REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT.
POD1000000028_S0000029	DID IT COME AT A PRICE? HELL YEAH.
POD1000000028_S0000030	THIS IS HEAVY METALS FROM 30 FOR 30 PODCAST. I'M ALYSSA ROENICK. GYMNASTICS HAS BEEN PART OF MY LIFE IN SOME FORM FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. FROM WATCHING MARY LOU ON TV AT THE 1984 OLYMPICS WHEN I WAS SEVEN, TO LATER BEING A TEENAGE GYMNAST OBSESSING OVER KIM ZEMESKUL'S TUMBLING PASSES.
POD1000000028_S0000031	AND FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS AT ESPN, WHERE MY REPORTING PARTNER BONNIE FORD AND I BOTH COVER INTERNATIONAL SPORTS.
POD1000000028_S0000032	WHEN I COVERED MY FIRST SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES IN BEIJING IN 2008, CHINA WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING AN UNDERAGE GYMNAST ON THE TEAM, AND I WAS WRITING ABOUT IT. I'LL NEVER FORGET BELLA CAROLI SHOUTING INTO MY DIGITAL RECORDER ABOUT HOW THE CHINESE COACHES HAD JUST STOLEN HIS PLAYBOOK.
POD1000000028_S0000033	I WISH I STILL HAD THAT TAPE. HERE WAS BELA KAROLYI, NOT JUST UPSET THAT CHINA HAD POSSIBLY BROKEN THE RULES, BUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE I KNEW HE DESERVED CREDIT FOR RECOGNIZING THAT YOUNGER AND SMALLER GYMNASTS HAD BETTER CHANCES FOR GOLD. IT WAS A POINT HE'D BEEN MAKING TO REPORTERS FOR YEARS.
POD1000000028_S0000035	AS THE TRUTH HAS COME TO LIGHT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF PINNING A NATION'S HOPES ON THE SHOULDERS OF CHILDREN, BELLA AND MARTA CAROLI HAVE COME UNDER SCRUTINY.
POD1000000028_S0000036	TODAY BREAKING NEWS ALLEGATIONS THAT STRIKE AT THE HEART OF A VERY SUCCESSFUL U.S. OLYMPIC SPORT.
POD1000000028_S0000037	ONE OF THE WORST THINGS WE HAVE SEEN IN US OLYMPIC HISTORY.
POD1000000028_S0000038	THEIR LEGACY IS LITTERED WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY THEY BEAR FOR THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE.
POD1000000028_S0000039	CLAIMS TONIGHT FROM A FORMER GYMNAST WHO HAS FILED SUIT AGAINST A DOCTOR AND LEGENDARY COACHES BELLA AND MARTA CAROLI.
POD1000000028_S0000040	YES, THIS UNNAMED GYMNAST ACCUSES THE CAROLLES OF TURNING A BLIND EYE TO ABUSE.
POD1000000028_S0000041	BUT AS COMPLICATED AS THEIR STORY WOULD BECOME, IT ALL STARTED WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE.
POD1000000028_S0000043	IT STARTED WITH PERFECTION.
POD1000000028_S0000045	AT THE 1976 OLYMPIC GAMES IN MONTREAL, 14 YEAR OLD NADIA COMANECI EARNED THE FIRST PERFECT 10 IN OLYMPIC GYMNASTICS HISTORY.
POD1000000028_S0000046	AND WHEN THE JUDGES ANNOUNCED HER SCORE, THE CROWD ERUPTED, BUT NO ONE MORE SO THAN NADIA'S COACH, BELLA CAROLI.
POD1000000028_S0000047	AT 33 YEARS OLD, BELLA AND MARTA CAROLI WERE JUST BEGINNING THEIR CAREER AS COACHES. OUTSIDE OF ROMANIA, THEY WERE UNKNOWNS. BUT BELLA WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS.
POD1000000028_S0000048	ESPECIALLY AS THE 6 FOOT PLUS COACH TOWERED OVER HIS 4 FOOT 11, 86 POUND PROTEGE.
POD1000000028_S0000050	OVER THE COURSE OF A SINGLE THRILLING WEEK, NADIA BECAME THE CROWD FAVORITE AND AN INTERNATIONAL STAR AS SHE SCORED PERFECT 10 AFTER PERFECT 10.
POD1000000028_S0000052	AN UNBELIEVABLE 7 PERFECT 10S ALL TOGETHER. AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL ALL AROUND, NADIA WON THE GOLD MEDAL, A FIRST FOR ROMANIA.
POD1000000028_S0000053	FINALLY NADIA COMES UP AND DOES HER INCREDIBLE ROUTINE. THAT'S WHERE THE CROWD EXPLODED. I MEAN THAT WAS EXPLOSION, EXPLOSION OF SUPPORT, EXPLOSION OF LOVE AND EXCITEMENT AND I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE CORNER OF MY EYES.
POD1000000028_S0000054	AND I SEE THE SOVIET TEAM GETTING THEIR STUFF AND THEY WALK IN OUT OF THE ARENA. I SAID, YES, YES, WE GOT IT.
POD1000000028_S0000055	FINALLY, AFTER DECADES OF DOMINANCE, A ROMANIAN HAD BEATEN THE SOVIETS.
POD1000000028_S0000056	IN A WAY FOR SOME PEOPLE THIS IS THE END OF A LOVE AFFAIR, THE DETHRONING OF THE USSR GYMNASTIC COMPETITION. NADIA KOMANECHA NOW TAKES OVER, 14 YEAR OLD SPRITE OF A GIRL.
POD1000000028_S0000057	BUT FOR BELA KAROLYI AND HIS WIFE AND COACHING PARTNER MARTA, THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN GREATER AT STAKE. THE FAVOR OF THE ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000028_S0000060	IT WAS LATE NIGHT, ROMANIAN TIME, SO I WAS WATCHING BEFORE TIM DOCTOR AND HIS WIFE, MARTA'S FRIEND, AND MY WIFE. WE WATCHED ON BLACK AND WHITE TV.
POD1000000028_S0000062	MY NAME IS GEZA POZSAR. THAT'S THE HUNGARIAN PRONUNCIATION. IN ENGLISH IT'S LIKE, GEZA POZSAR. SO, GEZA POZSAR.
POD1000000028_S0000063	GEZA POZAR WAS THE CHOREOGRAPHER FOR THE ROMANIAN NATIONAL TEAM.
POD1000000028_S0000064	HE'D BEEN WORKING WITH BELA AND MARTA FOR YEARS. HE DESIGNED NADIA'S FLOOR ROUTINE AND HELPED HER TRAIN FOR THIS MOMENT. BUT INSTEAD OF WATCHING FROM THE SIDELINES WITH BELA AND MARTA, HE WAS WATCHING FROM HOME. BECAUSE THE ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T LET HIM TRAVEL TO MONTREAL.
POD1000000028_S0000065	BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET THE VISA TO GO.
POD1000000028_S0000066	GÉZA HAD RECENTLY MARRIED A FRENCH WOMAN AND SO THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T TRUST HIM TO GO TO CANADA AND ACTUALLY RETURN TO ROMANIA.
POD1000000028_S0000068	FROM HIS LIVING ROOM IN THE SMALL TOWN OF ONEST, GHEZA, LIKE THE REST OF ROMANIA, WATCH NADIA MAKE HISTORY.
POD1000000028_S0000070	THE WHOLE TOWN CAME OUT TO THE STREETS. IT WAS LIKE MIDNIGHT. ALL OF THEM, THEY COME OUT AND IT WAS LIKE CARNIVAL IN RIO, YOU KNOW? IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. FIRST OF ALL, THEY GET DRUNK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE FIRST THING. BUT EVERYONE IS SO HAPPY.
POD1000000028_S0000071	AND THAT'S A HUGE CELEBRATION, HUGE.
POD1000000028_S0000072	BUT THIS MOMENT WAS BIGGER THAN JUST THE PARTY IN THOSE SMALL TOWN STREETS.
POD1000000028_S0000073	THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN ECSTASY, YOU KNOW?
POD1000000028_S0000074	THE WHOLE WORLD WAS IN ECSTASY. THAT'S WHY NADIA'S PERFECT TENS AND HER GOLD MEDAL WERE SO IMPORTANT. THEY MADE ROMANIA VISIBLE. A COUNTRY THAT SUDDENLY STOOD OUT FROM THE REST OF THE COMMUNIST BLOC.
POD1000000028_S0000075	NADIA WAS A LOVABLE FIGURE, FROM A PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD SAW AS VERY GRIM.
POD1000000028_S0000076	NADIA WAS THE DIAMOND. SHE WAS THE TREASURE OF ROMANIA. IT WAS THE BEST PRODUCT ROMANIA EVER HAD. NADIA PUT ROMANIA ON THE MAP. AFTER NADIA, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THERE IS ROMANIA.
POD1000000028_S0000078	DURING THE COLD WAR, SPORTS WERE A WAY FOR NATIONS TO ASSERT THEIR POWER WITHOUT GOING TO WAR. OLYMPIC SUCCESS EQUALED NATIONAL PRIDE. FOR ATHLETES AND COACHES IN ROMANIA, IT MEANT SECURITY AND STATURE. IT MEANT NOT WAITING IN LINE FOR A LOAF OF BREAD.
POD1000000028_S0000079	PEOPLE SUFFER SHORTAGES.
POD1000000028_S0000080	BROUGHT ABOUT DESPOTISM AND CORRUPTION OF THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000028_S0000081	ROMANIA AT THAT TIME WAS UNDER A VERY, VERY STRICT, UGLY DICTATORSHIP. AND IT WAS A CULT OF PERSONALITY.
POD1000000028_S0000082	A PUBLIC DISPLAY OF GIANT PORTRAITS OF COMMUNIST LEADERS.
POD1000000028_S0000083	WE HAD TO IDOLIZE THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY.
POD1000000028_S0000084	NADIA'S WIN WAS THE ULTIMATE POLITICAL VALIDATION FOR THE COUNTRY'S LEADER, NIKOLAI CEAUSESCU.
POD1000000028_S0000085	PAGANCI WAS BEFITTING THE CROWNING OF A PRINCESS.
POD1000000028_S0000086	IT WAS A NATIONAL CELEBRATION AND THE PRESIDENT GOT VERY EXCITED.
POD1000000028_S0000087	THIS PRESENTATION WAS MADE PERSONALLY BY THE PRESIDENT OF ROMANIA, NICOLAE CEAUȘESCU.
POD1000000028_S0000089	NADIA AND THE COROLIS WERE WELCOMED HOME TO ROMANIA AS HEROES.
POD1000000028_S0000090	THEY GAVE US AWARDS, YOU KNOW, WE GOT SOME BONUSES. WE PAID ONLY HALF OF THE TAXES LIKE EVERYBODY PAID. WE GOT 50% DEDUCTION ON OUR TAXES.
POD1000000028_S0000091	PROPAGANDA IS POWER IN A REGIME LIKE CEAUSESCU'S, AND THERE WAS NO BETTER PROPAGANDA THAN CELEBRATING AND REWARDING THE SUCCESS OF ITS OLYMPIC CHAMPION AND THE COACHES WHO HAD BROUGHT ROMANIA SUCH HIGH HONOR.
POD1000000028_S0000092	NADIA WAS MADE HERO OF THE SOCIALIST COUNTRY AND SHE WAS A HERO, WELL DECORATED.
POD1000000028_S0000093	A COUNTRY HONORED NADIA WITH ITS HIGHEST AWARD, THE HERO OF THE SOCIALIST LABOR.
POD1000000028_S0000094	SHE GOT THE CALL. BELLA GOT TWO CALLS.
POD1000000028_S0000095	NADIA AND THE COROLIS WERE GIFTED CARS. THEIR TAXES WERE CUT IN HALF. AS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DEALT WITH CRUSHING RATIONS, THE ROMANIAN COACHES AND THEIR CHOREOGRAPHER HAD MEALS DELIVERED TO THEM FOR FREE.
POD1000000028_S0000096	THE DAYS OF WAITING IN FOOD LINES WERE OVER FOR THEM.
POD1000000028_S0000097	THE ONLY THING WHAT THEY EXPECTED US TO DO IS TO WIN MEDALS.
POD1000000028_S0000098	AS LONG AS THEY COULD KEEP MAKING ROMANIA PROUD.
POD1000000028_S0000100	BELLA CAROLI HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN ATHLETE, BUT NEVER A GYMNAST.
POD1000000028_S0000101	HE WAS A BOXER IN THE BEGINNING, THEN HE BECAME A HAMMER THROWER, THEN HE BECAME A HANDBALL COACH. SO EVERYTHING ABOUT GYMNASTICS.
POD1000000028_S0000102	BELLA'S FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH GYMNASTICS DIDN'T COME UNTIL COLLEGE.
POD1000000028_S0000103	I HAD TO PASS SOME GYMNASTIC TEST, WHICH WAS ALL DIFFICULT TO ME. I WAS A TALL AND PRETTY HEAVY GUY.
POD1000000028_S0000104	IT WAS SOMETHING, SOMETHING TO SEE ME SWINGING ON THE BARS AND DOING A TUMBLING, WHICH IS AN UNKNOWN SPORT FOR ME, TOTALLY UNKNOWN BEFORE.
POD1000000028_S0000105	HE WAS INTRODUCED TO GYMNASTICS AND TO ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES, MARTA EROS, THE WOMAN HE WOULD MARRY.
POD1000000028_S0000106	I GOT MARRIED AND MY WIFE, A FORMER GYMNAST, SHE WAS A GOOD GYMNAST THOUGH, WE GOT MARRIED AND WE WENT OUT TO TEACH GYMNASTICS.
POD1000000028_S0000107	MARTA AND BELLA BOTH MAJORED IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION WITH THE GOAL OF COACHING YOUNG KIDS. THEY WANTED TO WORK TOGETHER AND DECIDED TO FOCUS ON HER SPECIALTY, GYMNASTICS.
POD1000000028_S0000108	IT WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE, A TOTALLY NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE TO TEACH YOUNG CHILDREN. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO START WITH THEM.
POD1000000028_S0000109	BELLA CAME TO THE SPORT NOT KNOWING MUCH ABOUT GYMNASTICS, BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE HE WAS ESSENTIALLY TEACHING HIMSELF THE BASICS OF THE SPORT BY TEACHING LITTLE KIDS WHO DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT GYMNASTICS THEMSELVES.
POD1000000028_S0000110	THAT'S SOMETHING GEZA NOTICED THE FIRST TIME HE SAW BELLA IN ACTION.
POD1000000028_S0000111	I SAW THIS BIG GUY, BIG GUY, ALL DRESSED IN A BLUE WARM UP, AND SOME VERY SMALL LITTLE KIDS WHO WERE UP ALMOST JUST UP TO HIS HIPS, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000028_S0000112	FLIPPING LIKE THE LITTLE FISHES IN THE WATER, LIKE LITTLE SILVER FISHES, TUMBLING ON THE FLOOR. SO IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE. AND I SAW THIS GUY WITH HUGE HANDS, SOMETIMES SPOUTING THEM AND THROWING THEM UP IN THERE AND CATCHING THEM.
POD1000000028_S0000113	OH MY GOD, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
POD1000000028_S0000114	IT WAS KIND OF AN IDEAL MATCH. GIANT BELLA COULD EASILY SPOT THESE SMALL KIDS AND HELP THEM SAFELY LEARN NEW SKILLS. HIS WIFE, MARTA, HAD THE GYMNASTICS KNOW HOW AND CREDIBILITY.
POD1000000028_S0000115	THEY STARTED TO TEACH VERY YOUNG KIDS VERY HARD TRICKS. EASY TO SPOT THEM, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000028_S0000116	THE KAROLIS REFINED THEIR SYSTEM IN LOCAL GYMNASIUMS FOR 10 YEARS BEFORE BREAKING ON TO THE NATIONAL STAGE.
POD1000000028_S0000117	AFTER THAT HE GOT IN CONNECTION WITH THE GYMNASTIC FEDERATION. WE GOT LOTS OF HELP FROM THEM.
POD1000000028_S0000118	BELLA AND MARTA'S APPROACH GOT RESULTS. NEARLY ALL OF THE ATHLETES ON THE ROMANIAN OLYMPIC TEAM THAT WON THE SILVER MEDAL IN 1976 HAD TRAINED WITH THE COROLLIS.
POD1000000028_S0000119	AS A GROUP, THEY WERE NOTICEABLY YOUNGER AND TINIER THAN THE GYMNASTS WHO HAD COME BEFORE THEM.
POD1000000028_S0000120	14 YEAR OLD NADIA COMANECI OF ROMANIA, 4 FEET 11, 86 POUNDS.
POD1000000028_S0000121	BY COMPARISON, THE 1972 OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST WAS A 19 YEAR OLD. THE 1968 GOLD MEDALIST WAS 26. THEY'D BEEN THROUGH PUBERTY. THEY WERE TALLER. THEY HAD WOMEN'S BODIES.
POD1000000028_S0000122	WHEN NADIA WON GOLD AT 14 YEARS OLD, IT SEALED THE TREND TOWARD CHILD ATHLETE.
POD1000000028_S0000123	THE YOUNGEST EVER TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL IN THE ALL AROUND COMPETITION.
POD1000000028_S0000124	NADIA, CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN. AND ONE THING I WANTED TO ASK HER, SHE'S THE YOUNGEST GIRL TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES. WHERE DOES SHE GO FROM HERE? WHAT ABOUT 1980?
POD1000000028_S0000127	I'M GOING TO PARTICIPATE AT THE OLYMPICS IN MOSCOW AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO BETTER THAN I DID HERE AND LEARN A LOT NEW THINGS.
POD1000000028_S0000128	HOW MANY MORE TENS DOES SHE EXPECT?
POD1000000028_S0000130	AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.
POD1000000028_S0000131	CONGRATULATIONS AND TO YOUR COACH, BELLA CAROLI.
POD1000000028_S0000132	BEFORE THE 1976 GAMES WERE EVEN OVER, THE ROMANIANS WERE FOCUSED ON REPEATING AND ADDING TO THAT SUCCESS. AND BECAUSE BELA WAS SEEN AS RESPONSIBLE FOR NADIA,
POD1000000028_S0000133	THE ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT PUT THE KAROLYI'S IN CHARGE OF A NEW NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER IN THE SMALL INDUSTRIAL TOWN OF DEVA.
POD1000000028_S0000134	BELA ALWAYS LIKED TO WORK IN THIS TYPE OF SMALL PLACES WHEN HE HAD A LOT OF CONTROL.
POD1000000028_S0000135	IT WAS ISOLATED. THAT WAS THE POINT. BELLA LIKED TO KEEP TABS ON THE GIRLS.
POD1000000028_S0000136	SO HE KNEW IF THE GIRLS WENT TO BUY SOME ICE CREAM OR... HE KNEW BECAUSE HE KNEW EVERYBODY. SO THE GIRLS WERE UNDER CONTROL AT THE TIME. HE CANNOT GO THERE AND BUY FOOD OR SOMETHING WITHOUT HIM KNOWING.
POD1000000028_S0000137	GEZA HAD MOVED TO DEVA WITH BELLA AND MARTA TO CONTINUE AS THE TEAM'S CHOREOGRAPHER AND DANCE COACH. THEY WERE WORKING AT THE PINNACLE OF ROMANIA'S CENTRALIZED SYSTEM.
POD1000000028_S0000138	AND THERE WAS TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO FIND MORE NADIA'S.
POD1000000028_S0000139	MY REAL FULL NAME IS GERTRUDE AMELIA EBERLE.
POD1000000028_S0000140	TRUDY KOLAR WAS A GYMNAST FOR ROMANIA'S NATIONAL TEAM FROM 1976 TO 1983. SHE COMPETED UNDER HER MIDDLE AND MAIDEN NAMES, EMILIA EBERLI.
POD1000000028_S0000141	BECAUSE IT SOUNDED MORE LIKE ROMANIAN.
POD1000000028_S0000142	BY AGE 12, TRUDY WAS THE REIGNING JUNIOR NATIONAL CHAMPION.
POD1000000028_S0000143	I JUST GOT A CALL AT HOME.
POD1000000028_S0000144	IT WAS BELLA COROLLI.
POD1000000028_S0000145	I SAW NADIA ON TV AND I LOVED GYMNASTICS AND I ALWAYS TOLD MY MOM, OH MY GOSH, I WISH I COULD TRAIN WITH HER, BUT THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN. AND THEN WE GET A PHONE CALL AND I WAS LIKE, I SAID, OKAY, MOM, LET'S GO.
POD1000000028_S0000146	TRUDY TRAVELED WITH HER MOTHER BY TRAIN TO DEVA.
POD1000000028_S0000147	I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN WE GOT THERE AND I SAW BELLA. HE LOOKED TO ME LIKE A MOUNTAIN. I WAS A LITTLE TINY GIRL AND HE WAS LIKE BIG AND ALL SMILING AND EVERYTHING.
POD1000000028_S0000148	HER MOTHER KISSED HER AND PLACED A HALF A LOAF OF BREAD IN A DRESSER DRAWER BEFORE LEAVING. SHE TOLD HER DAUGHTER TO PLEASE REMEMBER TO EAT.
POD1000000028_S0000149	SHE SAID, OKAY, HONEY, I NEED TO LEAVE NOW. I NEED TO CATCH THE TRAIN. I SAID, BYE, MOM. I GAVE HER A KISS AND THEN BELLA SHOWED HER TO THE, THROUGH THE HALLWAY TO THE DOOR.
POD1000000028_S0000150	AND I WAS JUST LIKE, OH, OKAY, BY MYSELF IN A ROOM. I SAID, OKAY, SO WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY STUFF? AND THE DOOR JUST SUDDENLY OPENS IN A SCARY WAY, YOU KNOW, JUST REALLY FAST.
POD1000000028_S0000151	AND BELLA COMES AND HE SMACKED ME OVER THE FACE SO HARD THAT IT FLEW ON MY BED. AND HE OPENED THE DRAWER WHERE MY BREAD WAS IN AND HE SAID, IF I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN EATING ANYTHING LIKE THIS, I WILL KILL YOU.
POD1000000028_S0000152	THAT WAS MY WELCOME.
POD1000000028_S0000154	DON'T MISUNDERSTAND, THE NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER AT A DRAB TOWN CALLED DAVA IS NOT A CONCENTRATION CAMP. THERE ARE PILLOW FIGHTS AND FUN AND GOING TO SCHOOL, BUT THERE'S MOSTLY TRAINING.
POD1000000028_S0000155	TOUGH TRAINING IT IS. THIS WAS NADIA IN HER TRAINING DAYS WITH COACH KAROLYI STANDING BY, BUT NOT CATCHING HER. IS THIS TRAINING OR TORTURE? AND WHAT DO THE YOUNGSTERS THINK ABOUT IT?
POD1000000028_S0000156	WE FAIL TO WATCH ALL THE TIME.
POD1000000028_S0000157	GABBY JAIKULESCU WAS 13 YEARS OLD WHEN SHE WAS RECRUITED TO TRAIN WITH TRUDY AND THE OTHER OLYMPIANS IN THE MAKING.
POD1000000028_S0000158	LIFE IN DEVA WAS ONE OF DEPRIVATION, BEATINGS, AND LIVING IN CONSTANT FEAR.
POD1000000028_S0000159	I TELL YOU WHAT I SAW WHEN I GOT THERE. YOU KNOW, TWO LITTLE CRACKERS IN THE MORNING. IT WAS A LITTLE FOOD, BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH.
POD1000000028_S0000160	I MEAN, I ATE TOOTHPASTE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO SLEEP. I WAS SO HUNGRY. AND I JUST FELT THAT I NEED SOMETHING IN MY STOMACH.
POD1000000028_S0000161	WE WERE EATING LEFTOVERS ON THE STREET. IF YOU FIND A LITTLE APPLE THAT WAS LIKE HALF EATEN, THEN YOU WOULD PICK IT UP.
POD1000000028_S0000162	YOU FALL ASLEEP DREAMING ABOUT CHOCOLATES FLOATING IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES. YOU FALL ASLEEP SEEING LIKE FRIED CHICKEN.
POD1000000028_S0000163	ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GO AND THE COACHES EAT TO A TABLE NEXT TO YOU AND THEY GET LIKE FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES AND THEY EAT RIGHT NEXT TO US AND WE SIT THERE WE HAVE
POD1000000028_S0000164	PLAIN YOGURT AND A BOILED EGG. OR YOU HAVE A DRY PIECE OF MEAT THAT GETS STUCK IN YOUR THROAT, IT'S SO DRY.
POD1000000028_S0000165	I MEAN, YOU GO TO SLEEP HUNGRY AND WITH ALL THAT TRAINING, YOU KNOW, TRAINING, TRAINING, TRAINING, AND WE WERE GIVEN A FIST OF VITAMINS OR WHO KNOWS WHAT WAS THAT.
POD1000000028_S0000166	AND WE NEVER KNEW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. AND THERE WERE TIMES WHERE 11 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT CAME AND BILLA CAME TO THE DORM AND SAID, PUT YOUR SHOES ON AND LET'S GO START RUNNING OUTSIDE, YOU FAT ASS PIGS.
POD1000000028_S0000168	GO RUN. RAIN, SHINE, SNOWING.
POD1000000028_S0000169	THERE WAS NO PATIENCE OR COMPASSION FOR INJURIES AT BELLA'S TRAINING CENTER.
POD1000000028_S0000170	HE WANTED EVERYTHING FAST, QUICK, YOU KNOW, PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER FAST, YOU KNOW. IF THE DOCTOR DIDN'T FOLLOW BELA'S ORDERS, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE OUT.
POD1000000028_S0000171	BELLA FIRED DOCTORS WHO DIDN'T FOLLOW HIS ORDERS, AND THE GYMNASTS KNEW THAT COMPLAINING ABOUT INJURIES COULD LEAD TO A BEATING.
POD1000000028_S0000172	ONE DAY, DOING A VAULT AT PRACTICE, GABBY LANDED AWKWARDLY AND BROKE TWO FINGERS. SHE WALKED BACK TO HER TEAMMATES AND SHOWED THEM HER THROBBING RIGHT HAND.
POD1000000028_S0000173	AND THEY TOLD ME, SHUT UP, DON'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE HE'S GONNA GET SO MAD. AND I HAD TO FINISH THAT PRACTICE WITH TWO BROKEN FINGERS.
POD1000000028_S0000174	I REMEMBER TRYING TO GRAB THE BAR WITH ONE OF THE HANDS. I COULD HAVE PUT TWO FINGERS DOWN. AND SOMEHOW HE JUST GOT KIND OF SICK OF LOOKING AT ME NOT DOING A GOOD JOB.
POD1000000028_S0000175	HE SAID A FEW WORDS, YOU KNOW, AND JUST DISMISSED ME. NOBODY'S GOING TO TAKE ME TO TAKE AN X RAY, NOT HAVE A DOCTOR TO LOOK AT THIS.
POD1000000028_S0000176	AND ALL WHAT I HEAR FROM COLLEAGUES IS JUST KEEP GOING.
POD1000000028_S0000177	EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GYMNAST'S LIVES IN DAVA WAS MONITORED. THE NATIONAL TEAM COACHES LISTENED TO THEIR PHONE CALLS AND INTERCEPTED THEIR MAIL.
POD1000000028_S0000178	WHEN HOMESICK GIRLS RAN AWAY FROM THE TRAINING CENTER, POLICE TOOK THEM BACK TO DEVA.
POD1000000028_S0000179	I WAS SO SCARED, I SWEAR I THOUGHT HE HAS EYES ON THE TREES, ON THE BUSHES, ON THE WALLS.
POD1000000028_S0000180	WE COULDN'T QUIT. IT WAS NOT A CHOICE. AND YOU HAD TO KEEP GOING AGAINST YOUR WILL, AGAINST EVERYTHING.
POD1000000028_S0000181	BELLA MAINTAINED COMPLETE CONTROL, WHILE MARTA CAME INTO THE GYM MOSTLY TO COACH BALANCE BEAM.
POD1000000028_S0000182	TO ME, IT ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE HE WAS ALWAYS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING AND SHE WAS DOING WHATEVER HE WANTED HER TO DO AND OBEYING EVERYTHING.
POD1000000028_S0000183	WHEN MARTA WAS IN THE GYM, SHE COULD ALSO BE PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE.
POD1000000028_S0000184	AND WE COULD ACTUALLY DEFEND OURSELVES FROM HER BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CATCH US AND HIT US.
POD1000000028_S0000185	SO, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES SHE WOULD SCRATCH US AND SHE WOULD GRAB US FROM THE NECK LIKE THIS AND THEN SHE WOULD POUR HER FINGERNAILS INTO YOUR MEAT AND IT KIND OF HURT. BUT SHE WAS NOT GOOD AT BEATING.
POD1000000028_S0000186	BELLA WAS THE BAD ONE. OH GOSH, THAT WAS BAD.
POD1000000028_S0000187	AND WHEN THEY FALTERED AT MEATS, THEY FACED HIS WRATH.
POD1000000028_S0000188	LET'S SAY YOU FELL ON BEAM, THAT WAS A DISASTER. YOU GOT OFF THE BEAM, SALUTED THE JUDGES, AND WE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BATHROOM AND HE CAME AFTER US AND WE GOT BEATEN UP.
POD1000000028_S0000190	AND THEN HE SAID, WELL, YOU BETTER PUT YOURSELF TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO MORE EVENTS.
POD1000000028_S0000191	THE GIRLS' ONLY RESPITE FROM BELLA AND MARTA WAS THEIR DANCE CLASSES WITH GEZA.
POD1000000028_S0000192	YOU KNOW, IT WAS RELAXING FOR US. IT WAS FUN. HE COULD MAKE US, YOU KNOW, SMILE AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
POD1000000028_S0000193	THEY ALSO KNEW HE WOULD LOOK OUT FOR THEM.
POD1000000028_S0000194	GEZA WAS ALWAYS THE ONE THAT WAS ALWAYS BEHIND BELLA'S BACK. HE WAS PROTECTING US.
POD1000000028_S0000195	WHEN HE WAS TOGETHER WITH BELLA AND MARTA, HE WAS A TOUGH GUY BECAUSE HE HAD TO LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY LOST HIS JOB IF HE DIDN'T.
POD1000000028_S0000196	SO EVERY TIME WE WENT TO PRACTICE AT THE GYM IN THE AFTERNOON AND GEZA WAS THERE BEFORE AND HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE DOOR LOOKING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND WHEN BELLA MARKED, HE SAID, SIX, SIX, SIX AND FIVE. FIVE WAS MARKED AND SIX WAS BELLA.
POD1000000028_S0000197	GEZA USED DANCE COUNTS AS CODE NAMES FOR MARTA AND BELLA.
POD1000000028_S0000198	THAT'S HOW WE KNEW WHEN HE SAID SIX, WE ALREADY WERE LIKE, OH MY GOSH, BELLA'S COMING.
POD1000000028_S0000199	SOME DAYS, BELLA DISAPPEARED FROM THE GYM TO GO HUNTING.
POD1000000028_S0000200	THOSE ARE THE BEST DAYS OF OUR LIVES IN THE GYM. SO BASICALLY DRACULA WASN'T THERE.
POD1000000028_S0000201	WHO WAS DRACULA?
POD1000000028_S0000202	OH, BELLA.
POD1000000028_S0000204	BELLA AND MARTA FACED ENORMOUS PRESSURE GOING INTO THE 1980 OLYMPICS. THEIR STANDING WITH THE GOVERNMENT WAS ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR NEXT RESULT.
POD1000000028_S0000205	THEY'D HAVE TO MATCH OR BEAT THE SUCCESS OF THE 76 GAMES TO KEEP THEIR COUNTRY'S FAVOR.
POD1000000028_S0000206	THE ENTIRE ROMANIAN TEAM FELT THE WEIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY'S OPPRESSIVE REGIME WHEN THEY MET WITH OFFICIALS BEFORE THEY LEFT FOR MOSCOW.
POD1000000028_S0000207	SOME KIND OF LIEUTENANT, I DON'T KNOW, HE WAS ALL DRESSED IN GREEN AND STUFF, BIG GUY AND REALLY SERIOUS. AND HE SAID, YOU BETTER THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING TWICE. DON'T YOU EVER BRING SHAME ON YOUR COUNTRY. YOU'RE WEIGHING OUR COUNTRY ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
POD1000000028_S0000208	TRYING TO DEFEND HER GOLD MEDAL IN THE ALL AROUND, NADIA BECAME THE CENTER OF A JUDGING DISPUTE.
POD1000000028_S0000210	NADIA WENT ON A BEAM AND HER BEAM SCORE DIDN'T COME UP.
POD1000000028_S0000212	BELLA PROTESTED NADIA'S LOW BEAM SCORE IN FULL VIEW OF THE TELEVISION CAMERAS.
POD1000000028_S0000214	NADIA HAD TO SETTLE FOR SILVER IN THE ALL AROUND, BUT WENT ON TO WIN GOLD ON FLOOR AND BEAM. TRUDY WON A SILVER MEDAL ON THE UNEVEN BARS.
POD1000000028_S0000215	THE ROMANIANS REPEATED WITH A SILVER IN THE TEAM COMPETITION. BUT THIS TIME FINISHING SECOND TO THE RUSSIANS WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. BELA AND MARTA WEREN'T RETURNING TO ROMANIA AS HEROES AGAIN.
POD1000000028_S0000216	SO WHEN WE MADE A BIG BROUHAHA ABOUT NADIA'S CALLING ON ME, THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T LIKE IT.
POD1000000028_S0000217	IN A SOCIETY HYPER SENSITIVE ABOUT HOW IT WAS PERCEIVED ON THE WORLD STAGE, AND PARTICULARLY BY ITS COMMUNIST ALLIES, BELA'S PROTEST IN RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN JUDGE EMBARRASSED THE ROMANIAN OFFICIALS.
POD1000000028_S0000218	PLUS, HIS MOST IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE CEAUSESCU REGIME,
POD1000000028_S0000219	HAD JUST BEEN DEMOTED.
POD1000000028_S0000220	SO BELA KNEW THAT THE END IS CLOSE. HE TOLD ME AT THAT MOMENT, WE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE. AND FROM THERE EVERYTHING STARTED TO GO SOUR FOR US.
POD1000000028_S0000222	THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW BELA KAROLYI IN ACTION WITH HIS GYMNASTS WAS PRETTY MEMORABLE.
POD1000000028_S0000224	IT WAS THE NADIA 81 TOUR WHEN BELLA AND THE ROMANIAN WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM TOURED WITH THE AMERICAN TEAM IN MARCH 1981.
POD1000000028_S0000225	MY REPORTING PARTNER, BONNIE FORD, COVERED THE DETROIT STOP OF THE NADIA 81 TOUR, A SEVEN CITY PROMOTIONAL TOUR OF THE U.S. FEATURING THE ROMANIAN NATIONAL TEAM AND ITS SUPERSTAR.
POD1000000028_S0000226	SO I PERSONALLY, AS BOTH AN OLYMPIC FAN AND A REPORTER AT THAT TIME, I DIDN'T THINK OF IT AS A POLITICAL EVENT WHERE THE ROMANIANS WERE SHOWING OFF THEIR SYSTEM, SO TO SPEAK.
POD1000000028_S0000227	CERTAINLY, THEY DID. THEY SAW IT AS A PROPAGANDA TOOL AND A CHANCE TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR EXCELLENCE.
POD1000000028_S0000229	BUT TO ME, IT WAS JUST A CHANCE TO SEE THE BEST ATHLETE IN HER SPORT.
POD1000000028_S0000231	I WAS FOCUSED ON NADIA, THE AUDIENCE WAS FOCUSED ON NADIA, A LOT OF VERY EXCITED YOUNG GIRLS. THIS WAS LIKE BEATLEMANIA. NADIA MANIA WAS DEFINITELY A REAL THING.
POD1000000028_S0000233	BELLA COROLLI WAS VERY VISIBLE AND HE WAS UNMISTAKABLE ON THE FLOOR. HUGE GUY. HE WAS, IN OUR EYES, THE GURU, THE GENIUS BEHIND NADIA'S PRECISION AND PERFECTION.
POD1000000028_S0000234	BEING ON TOUR WITH BELLA AS THE ROMANIANS COACH, IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH HIM AND THE GYMNAST REALLY, JUST HOW THEY INTERACTED WITH EACH OTHER.
POD1000000028_S0000235	THE U.S. NATIONAL TEAM HAD BEEN INVITED TO PERFORM WITH THE ROMANIANS ON THEIR TOUR. TRACY TALAVERA WAS A MEMBER OF THAT TEAM.
POD1000000028_S0000236	THE GYMNASTS WERE ALWAYS VERY STERN, VERY ROBOTIC. THEY WORKED EXTREMELY HARD. THEY DID NUMBERS OF ROUTINES AND SKILLS WAY BEYOND WHAT WE HAD EVER SEEN.
POD1000000028_S0000237	MIKE JACKIE, THE MAN WHO WOULD BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE US GYMNASTICS FEDERATION, WAS ON THE TOUR, WORKING FOR ONE OF THE EQUIPMENT SPONSORS. HE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE CAROLLIS.
POD1000000028_S0000238	MARTA WAS IN THE BACKGROUND. SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. BELLA INSTRUCTED HER LIKE HE INSTRUCTED EVERYBODY ELSE. SHE WAS VERY SUBSERVIENT. I MEAN, IT WAS NOT A COACHING DUEL.
POD1000000028_S0000239	HE WAS DEFINITELY THE COACH AND SHE WAS DEFINITELY THE THIRD ASSISTANT, EVEN THOUGH THERE WASN'T A FIRST OR SECOND ASSISTANT.
POD1000000028_S0000240	BUT DESPITE HOW WELL THE TOUR WAS GOING, THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES WERE DETERIORATING FOR THE ROMANIAN COACHES.
POD1000000028_S0000241	THEY COULD TELL FROM THE WAY OFFICIALS WERE TREATING THEM THAT THEY WERE IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR JOBS AND THEIR PRESTIGE.
POD1000000028_S0000242	WE WENT THERE AND WE WERE TREATED VERY POORLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TOUR. I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE GYMNASTICS FEDERATION GAVE US A COLD SHOULDER.
POD1000000028_S0000243	ON THE WASHINGTON, D.C. STOP, THEY WERE INVITED TO A DINNER PARTY HOSTED BY THE ROMANIAN AMBASSADOR.
POD1000000028_S0000244	AND AT THE DINNER PARTY, NOBODY WOULD TALK TO US. THEY LOOK AT US LIKE STRANGERS, LIKE NOT EVEN PART OF THE TEAM. I THINK THEY HAD A FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.
POD1000000028_S0000245	BELA SAID THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY FUTURE BACK IN ROMANIA.
POD1000000028_S0000246	THE TOUR WAS ALMOST OVER. IN TWO DAYS THEY'D BE HEADED HOME. THE KAROLIS AND GEZA KNEW THINGS COULD ONLY GET WORSE FOR THEM. THAT THEIR FAVOR WITH A FICKLE AND PUNITIVE GOVERNMENT WAS WANING.
POD1000000028_S0000247	THEY WERE TIRED OF THE SCRUTINY. IN ROMANIA, EVERYONE WAS WATCHED ALL THE TIME. BELA HAD FANTASIZED ABOUT WHAT A LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES COULD BE.
POD1000000028_S0000248	THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION.
POD1000000028_S0000249	WE MADE A PLAN.
POD1000000028_S0000250	AFTER THE FINAL SHOW, THE TEAM RETURNED TO NEW YORK BEFORE TRAVELING BACK TO ROMANIA. BUT THE COACHES HAD NO INTENTION OF GETTING ON THAT PLANE.
POD1000000028_S0000251	MARTA HAD AN AUNT WITH A PLACE IN MANHATTAN THAT THEY COULD USE TO HIDE OUT FOR A FEW DAYS. IN ORDER TO GET THERE, GEZA WOULD HAVE TO DISTRACT HIS ROOMMATE, THE HEAD OF THE ROMANIAN SECURITY DETAIL.
POD1000000028_S0000252	THE PLAN WAS THAT I WILL TAKE THE SECRET SERVICE GUY OUT TO SHOPPING AND THEN WE MEET AT THE APARTMENT.
POD1000000028_S0000254	THE MORNING OF MARCH 30, 1981, TRUDY AND HER TEAMMATES WERE TOLD THEY COULD GO SHOPPING, AS LONG AS THEY WERE BACK IN TIME TO BOARD A BUS TO JFK AIRPORT AT NOON.
POD1000000028_S0000255	SO WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY AND WE MET DOWN IN THE HALLWAY AND THEY SAID, OKAY, SO YOU HAVE TWO HOURS, NO FUNNY BUSINESS, NO CHOCOLATES, NO EATING, NO NOTHING.
POD1000000028_S0000256	THEN WE ALL WENT OUT THE DOOR. PROBABLY I WALKED LIKE 10 STEPS AND BELLA SAYS, TRUDY,
POD1000000028_S0000257	I NEEDED TO COME BACK. I STARTED CRYING. I SAID, OH MY GOSH, WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG THIS TIME? HE SAID, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK WITH US IN OUR ROOM. I STARTED CRYING BECAUSE I THOUGHT, I MEAN, JUST THE FEAR OF WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG?
POD1000000028_S0000258	TRUDY FOLLOWED BELLA'S ORDERS AND WENT BACK TO THEIR ROOM WITH MARTA.
POD1000000028_S0000259	I GO BACK WITH MARTA TO THE HOTEL ROOM AND VERY UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR. SHE WENT, LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW, WENT, WALKED BACK TO THE DOOR, LOOKED TO THE WINDOW, WALKED BACK TO THE DOOR, AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, WHAT IN THE WORLD? GOSH, AM I, NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WAITING TO GET BEATEN UP?
POD1000000028_S0000260	AND I THINK WE WAITED A GOOD HALF AN HOUR AND THEN HE COMES THROUGH THE DOOR WITH A THIS KIND OF LOOK ON HIS FACE LIKE HE WAS ALL PALE AND STUFF LIKE THAT. HE SAYS, JUDY, WE'RE NOT COMING BACK ANYMORE.
POD1000000028_S0000261	WHEN I HEARD THAT, I ASKED, WHAT? THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT I TALKED. I SAID, WHAT? HE SAID, WELL, WE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING TO STAY HERE. WE'RE NOT COMING BACK.
POD1000000028_S0000262	BELLA AND MARTA ASKED TRUDY TO BRING BACK LUGGAGE FOR THEIR FAMILIES.
POD1000000028_S0000263	AND THEN THEY JUST TOLD ME SAID WE JUST HAVE ONE REQUEST. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THIS ROOM. YOU DON'T LEAVE THIS ROOM FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER WE'RE OUT OF THIS ROOM.
POD1000000028_S0000264	AND YOU CANNOT TELL ANYBODY ANYTHING UNTIL YOU GET ON THE PLANE. THEY LEFT AND I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS AND I SAW THEM THROWING THEIR LUGGAGE INTO A TAXI. THEY JUMPED TO A TAXI AND LEFT.
POD1000000028_S0000265	AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW FOR SURE. I SAID, OH, WE REALLY, WE REALLY GOT RID OF THE DRACULA. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET BEATEN EVER AGAIN. LIFE IS GOING TO BE GOOD FROM NOW ON.
POD1000000028_S0000266	MEANWHILE, GEZA GOT HIS SECURITY GUARD ROOMMATE OUT OF THE HOTEL AND INTO THE CROWDED STREETS OF TIMES SQUARE FOR THEIR OWN SHOPPING TRIP.
POD1000000028_S0000267	IT'S A BIG SALE, I SAID, BIG SALE. I THINK WE HAD A FEELING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON. WE HAD SOME PLANS. HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO. AND SUDDENLY HE SEES A LITTLE STORE WITH UMBRELLAS.
POD1000000028_S0000268	FAISA HAD HIS OPPORTUNITY.
POD1000000028_S0000269	I SAW A CAB STOPPING DOWN THE STREET. I JUMPED TO THE CAB AND I WAS GONE.
POD1000000028_S0000270	GEZA MADE HIS WAY TO MEET BELLA AND MARTA AT HER AUNT'S APARTMENT.
POD1000000028_S0000271	AND WHEN THEY SAW ME, THEY JUMPED UP AND DOWN, AND I MADE IT. WE WERE VERY HAPPY.
POD1000000028_S0000272	AFTER TRUDY SAW THE KAROLIS LEAVE, SHE WENT OUT AND FOUND HER TEAMMATES ON THEIR SHOPPING EXPEDITION AND LOADED UP ON CHOCOLATES.
POD1000000028_S0000273	I DID, I GOT CHOCOLATES AND I ATE EVEN, I ATE CHOCOLATES RIGHT WHEN I BOUGHT IT, IT WAS THE TIME OF MY LIFE.
POD1000000028_S0000274	THERE WAS NO ONE TO STOP HER. AT NOON, AS PLANNED, THE ROMANIAN NATIONAL TEAM BOARDED A BUS TO THE AIRPORT.
POD1000000028_S0000275	SO WE FINALLY GOT ON A BUS AND THE SECURITY GUY WHO WAS ALREADY GREEN ON HIS FACE, HE WAS ALL GREEN, HE SAID, WHERE'S BELLA? YOU KNOW IT. I SAID, I DON'T KNOW. HOW SHOULD I KNOW? MAYBE THEY DIDN'T COME BACK FROM THE STORE YET. I HAVE NO IDEA.
POD1000000028_S0000276	THERE WAS NO SIGN OF BELLA, MARTA, OR GEZA.
POD1000000028_S0000277	AND SO THE BUS LEFT. WE GOT TO THE AIRPORT, NO BELLA. WE GOT TO THE PLANE, NO BELLA.
POD1000000028_S0000278	THE PLANE WAITED THREE HOURS ON THE TARMAC.
POD1000000028_S0000279	I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT TO MYSELF. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT UNTIL THE PLANE TOOK OFF AND I SAW THEY'RE NOT IN THE PLANE. I SAID, OKAY, NOW THEY CAN'T COME ANYMORE.
POD1000000028_S0000280	IT'S BEEN SOME TIME SINCE THE UNITED STATES HAS HAD A REALLY TOP DRAWER DEFECTION FROM THE COMMUNIST BLOC OF NATIONS. BUT OVERNIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON, A TRIPLE DEFECTION BY THREE ROMANIANS BECAME KNOWN, WHICH HAS OVERJOYED THE AMERICAN ATHLETIC WORLD.
POD1000000028_S0000281	ROMANIAN GYMNASTICS COACH BELA CAROLI, ONE OF THE WORLD'S BEST. HIS WIFE MARTA, ALSO A HIGHLY REGARDED TRAINER. AND GEZA POSAR, THE TOP CHOREOGRAPHER FOR THE ROMANIAN WOMEN'S TEAM. TODAY, THEY WERE AT THE CAPITAL, ASKING A CONGRESSMAN TO HELP REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR FAMILIES.
POD1000000028_S0000282	THE COROLLIS LEFT A SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN ROMANIA, GEZA POSAR, A WIFE AND A YOUNG DAUGHTER.
POD1000000028_S0000283	ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THEY ARE EXTREMELY WARM AND I BELIEVE VERY TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF THE DESIRE TO BE FREE.
POD1000000028_S0000284	THE U.S. ALREADY HAS GRANTED THE COACHES PERMISSION TO WORK, AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY PLAN TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST.

POD1000000028_S0000329	THIS SEASON OF 30 FOR 30 PODCAST WAS PRODUCED IN ASSOCIATION WITH ESPNW.
POD1000000030_S0000001	IF IT SAVES ENERGY AND GIVES YOUR PERFORMANCE A BOOST, WELL, WHEN IS A SHOE JUST A SHOE? FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. I'M JACK STEWART, IN FOR MOLLY WOOD.
POD1000000030_S0000003	WORLD ATHLETICS, THE GOVERNING BODY FOR TRACK AND FIELD, IS SET TO ANNOUNCE WHETHER IT'LL BAN CERTAIN TYPES OF SHOES.
POD1000000030_S0000004	IN PARTICULAR, NIKE'S VAPORFLY SHOES HAVE BEEN PROMINENTLY ON THE FEET OF ATHLETES RESPONSIBLE FOR TUMBLING RACE RECORDS RECENTLY.
POD1000000030_S0000005	NIKE CLAIMS THE $250 SNEAKERS SHAVE UP TO 4% OFF A RUNNER'S TIME. SO IS THAT TECHNOLOGY DOPING?
POD1000000030_S0000006	WE GOT A HOLD OF IAN HUNTER, PROFESSOR OF EXERCISE SCIENCE AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY, AS HE WAS WITH SOME ATHLETES TRAINING AT BYU'S INDOOR TRACK. HE TOLD US THE SHOES WORK BY COMBINING FOAM IN THE SOLE WITH A CARBON FIBER PLATE.
POD1000000030_S0000007	I THINK THE PLATE MOSTLY ALLOWS FOR SOME STRUCTURE OF THE SHOES.
POD1000000030_S0000008	SO IF THAT PLATE WASN'T THERE AND YOU HAVE A 44 MILLIMETER HEIGHT OFF THE GROUND THAT'S JUST FOAM AND YOU TRY RUNNING AROUND A CORNER, IT'S JUST GOING TO COLLAPSE ON YOU.
POD1000000030_S0000009	SO THE PLANE...
POD1000000030_S0000011	MAINLY GIVE STRUCTURE TO THE SHOE, BUT IT DOES GIVE A SMALL BENEFIT IN TERMS OF ENERGY COST.
POD1000000030_S0000012	COMBINE THAT WITH NOW YOU CAN DO HIGHER FOAM BECAUSE YOU CAN HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER WITH THE PLATE.
POD1000000030_S0000013	AND YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD PUSHING INTO THE GROUND, BIG DISPLACEMENT OF THE FOOT WHILE IT INTERACTS WITH THE GROUND AND THEN PUSHES OFF REALLY EFFECTIVELY.
POD1000000030_S0000014	SO IT QUITE LITERALLY PUTS A SPRING IN YOUR STEP.
POD1000000030_S0000015	YEAH, IT'S NOT A COILED SPRING LIKE WE'RE USED TO, BUT ANY FOAM IS REALLY A SPRING. THIS ONE'S JUST REALLY EFFECTIVE AT IT.
POD1000000030_S0000016	BUT WHERE'S THE LINE? THAT'S WHAT THE QUESTION IS NOW. AND I THINK THESE ARE EITHER AT THE LINE WHERE I'D FEEL COMFORTABLE OR A LITTLE BIT BEYOND.
POD1000000030_S0000017	SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE COULD STILL BE SOME INNOVATION ALLOWED IN SHOES? WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY EVERYBODY MUST WEAR THE SAME TYPE OF SHOE, BUT THERE MUST BE A LIMIT TO IT.
POD1000000030_S0000018	YEAH, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE INNOVATION AND WHAT NIKE'S DONE IS PROPELLED OTHER COMPANIES TO CATCH UP AND THEY WILL CATCH UP.
POD1000000030_S0000019	SO WE COULD HAVE THE STANDARD FOR MARATHONING OR ROAD RACING IS A SHOE LIKE THE VAPORFLY, BUT THEN NIKE OR SOMEONE WILL GO A LITTLE FURTHER WITH IT.
POD1000000030_S0000020	AND WE'LL END UP WITH LIKE 60 MILLIMETER FOAM AND ENOUGH CARBON FIBER TO HOLD THE STRUCTURE OF IT SO YOU'RE NOT COLLAPSING BUT IT'LL JUST CONTINUE ON
POD1000000030_S0000021	AND AT SOME POINT THE RULES NEED TO JUST STANDARDIZE HERE'S WHAT A SHOE IS.
POD1000000030_S0000022	THE PRICE OF THESE SHOES TO US AMATEURS OUT THERE SEEMS INCREDIBLY HIGH. IS IT SORT OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR A TOP OF THE LINE RUNNING SHOE?
POD1000000030_S0000023	YEAH, WHEN I SAY $250 FOR A PAIR OF SHOES, THE NIKE HAS MENTIONED PROBABLY WILL LAST YOU ABOUT 90 MILES BEFORE IT'S LOSING SOME OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS.
POD1000000030_S0000024	THAT IS GETTING TO THE POINT OF NOT OUTRAGEOUS, BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE RESTRICTED BY THE COST OF IT AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR CHEAPER OPTIONS.
POD1000000030_S0000025	IF NEW BALANCE, ALCONY, OTHERS START COMPETING WITH THE SAME QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SHOE AND ARE CHARGING $150, NIKE'S GOING TO HAVE TO START DROPPING THEIR COST DOWN.
POD1000000030_S0000026	SO IT'S JUST THE NATURAL HOW MARKETING WORKS AND IT'LL ALL COME TO AN EQUILIBRIUM OVER TIME.
POD1000000030_S0000027	I REMEMBER READING ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES THAT SOME FORMS OF ARTIFICIAL LEGS COULD GIVE RUNNERS, POTENTIALLY OVER RUNNERS WITH LIKE NATURAL BORN LEGS. I MEAN, ARE WE JUST REACHING A POINT WHERE KIND OF SPORT IS HARD ENGINEERING?
POD1000000030_S0000028	IT IS, AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE, BUT THERE HAVE TO BE SOME RESTRICTIONS TO HOW FAR YOU GO.
POD1000000030_S0000029	WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE TEMPTED TO AMPUTATE THEIR LOWER LEGS SO THEY CAN GO FROM A 215 MARATHONER TO A 205 MARATHONER.
POD1000000030_S0000030	OUR LEGS AREN'T BUILT JUST FOR RUNNING. THEY'RE BUILT FOR CLIMBING AND SWIMMING AND JUMPING AND ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES.
POD1000000030_S0000031	SO IF YOU TUNE THE LEG TO BE TUNED JUST FOR RUNNING, THEY'LL BE GREAT AT RUNNING BUT NOT GOOD AT OTHER THINGS
POD1000000030_S0000032	AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD GO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE RULES ESTABLISHED.
POD1000000030_S0000033	GIVEN THAT THESE SHOES DO KIND OF HAVE A LIMITED LIFE, DO ATHLETES TRAIN IN THEM AND ACTUALLY RUN IN THEM IN RACES OR DO YOU SORT OF HOLD THEM OFF FOR THAT PERFORMANCE BOOST WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT?
POD1000000030_S0000034	WELL, IF THEY'RE SPONSORED BY NIKE, THEY'LL DO ALL OF THEIR RACE PACE WORK IN THOSE SHOES.
POD1000000030_S0000035	BUT IF THEY'RE BUYING THEIR OWN SHOES, WHAT I TYPICALLY SEE IS THEY BUY THE PAIR, DO MAYBE TWO WORKOUTS IN THEM BEFORE THE RACE, SO THEY PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT 15 TO 20 MILES ON THEM, AND THEN THEY DO THE RACE.
POD1000000030_S0000036	AND THEN THEY'LL MAYBE WORK OUT IN THOSE ONES BUT BUY A NEW PAIR BEFORE THE NEXT RACE THEY DO.
POD1000000030_S0000037	AND THAT'S IF IT'S SOMEONE THAT CARES ABOUT SAVING A COUPLE MINUTES ON A MARATHON TIME.
POD1000000030_S0000038	I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE OR TWO MINUTES THE BENEFIT THAT MOST WOULD GET FROM THIS TOO.
POD1000000030_S0000039	THE PRICE OF PROGRESS, I GUESS. IAN HUNTER THERE, WHO WORKS WITH USA TRACK & FIELD.
POD1000000030_S0000041	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS. NIKE SHOES FIRST CAME TO PROMINENCE IN 2016 WHEN THEY WERE WORN BY THE FIRST THREE FINISHERS IN THE RIO OLYMPICS MEN'S MARATHON.
POD1000000030_S0000042	AN ESTIMATED 95 OF THE FIRST 100 FINISHERS IN LAST YEAR'S VALENCIA MARATHON WERE WEARING VAPORFLY SHOES.
POD1000000030_S0000043	THAT'S JUST TWO OF THE STATISTICS THAT REUTERS HAS PULLED TOGETHER TO SHOW THE DOMINANCE OF THIS TECH IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT VERSIONS. SOME GRAPHS IN THEIR ARTICLE TOO FOR MY FELLOW DATA NERDS.
POD1000000030_S0000044	I ALSO GOT LOST IN A NEW WALL STREET JOURNAL VIDEO ON THE SHOES AND THE CONTROVERSY AROUND THEM, WHICH AS IT SAYS, SOME ARE CALLING A SEISMIC SHIFT.
POD1000000030_S0000045	SO WE'LL LINK YOU TO THAT. AND A VOICE YOU HEAR ON MARKETPLACE TECH FROM TIME TO TIME, NICK THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WIRED MAGAZINE, IS ALSO A KEEN MARATHONER.
POD1000000030_S0000046	AND HE SET OUT TO PUT THESE SNEAKERS TO THE TEST HIMSELF BY RUNNING THE NEW YORK MARATHON WEARING THEM AND CRUNCHING ALL OF HIS DATA.
POD1000000030_S0000047	THEY FELT STRANGE AND WOBBLY AT FIRST, HE SAYS. MY INITIAL STEPS REMINDED ME OF PUTTING ON ICE SKATES AND THEN WALKING ON A RUBBER MAT TO THE RINK.
POD1000000030_S0000048	BUT ONCE I STARTED RUNNING, THE STRANGENESS DISAPPEARED AND I FORGOT I WAS WEARING THEM.
POD1000000030_S0000049	MORE OF HIS EXPERIENCES AND HIS CRUNCHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC DATA TO SEE IF HE EXPERIENCED THE TECH DOPING EFFECT AT MARKETPLACETECH.ORG
POD1000000030_S0000050	I'M JACK STEWART AND THAT IS MARKETPLACE TECH.
POD1000000030_S0000052	THIS IS APM.
POD1000000031_S0000001	THE HOLIDAYS ARE OVER, IT'S BACK TO REALITY FOR MOST OF US, AND BACK TO SOME DISTANT WAREHOUSE FOR A LOT OF OUR UNWANTED GIFTS.
POD1000000031_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY.
POD1000000031_S0000003	I'M JACK STEWART, IN FOR MOLLY WOOD.
POD1000000031_S0000005	THIS SEASON'S ONLINE HOLIDAY SALES WERE WORTH SOME $138 BILLION TO E RETAILERS.
POD1000000031_S0000006	BUT NEARLY A THIRD OF THAT STUFF IS EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED, ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH FROM CBRE, A REAL ESTATE RESEARCH GROUP.
POD1000000031_S0000007	AND THAT'S PRETTY TYPICAL. 30% OF ONLINE SHOPPING IS RETURNED, VERSUS 8% OF STUFF BOUGHT IN SHOPS.
POD1000000031_S0000008	AND ALL OF THOSE RETURNS COME WITH A COST, EVEN IF THEY'RE FREE TO US, THE SHOPPERS.
POD1000000031_S0000009	THERE'S THE EMISSIONS FROM THE TRUCKS AND PLANES, THE WASTE FROM PACKAGING AND DISCARDED PRODUCTS, THE COST OF FINDING SPACE FOR IT ALL, OR EVEN JUST CHUCKING IT OUT.
POD1000000031_S0000010	DAVID EGAN WITH CBRE SAYS RIGHT ABOUT NOW WAREHOUSE WORKERS ARE GETTING BURIED.
POD1000000031_S0000011	WELL, IT'S JUST THE FLOOD OF PACKAGES. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS BUILT AND DESIGNED, IT REALLY IS MEANT TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE IN MOVING PRODUCT FROM THE POINT OF PRODUCTION, SO WHEREVER SOMETHING IS MADE, TO THE END POINT, THE POINT OF CONSUMPTION.
POD1000000031_S0000012	AND ALL OF THE NETWORKS, THE BUILDINGS, THE FLOW THROUGH THE BUILDINGS, THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS, EVEN THE WAY THE EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO HANDLE THE PACKAGES ARE REALLY MEANT TO GET THAT STUFF MOVING OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
POD1000000031_S0000013	ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE COULD USE TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM?
POD1000000031_S0000014	IN MY OPINION, THE REAL SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION AT THE POINT OF SALE. SO HOW DO YOU PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER BETTER ASSURANCE THAT WHAT THEY'RE BUYING IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT?
POD1000000031_S0000015	SO THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE IS SOMEONE BUYS THREE OR FOUR SHIRTS WITH THE INTENTION OF ONLY KEEPING ONE OR TWO OF THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE SIZE IS RIGHT, THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE COLOR IS QUITE GOING TO BE RIGHT, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO FEEL LIKE.
POD1000000031_S0000016	AND I DO THINK THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES BETWEEN AUGMENTED REALITY AND VIRTUAL REALITY WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHOP ONLINE AND HAVE A MORE, YOU KNOW, A SENSE OF AN IN PERSON TYPE OF EXPERIENCE, WHICH I BELIEVE WILL REALLY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RETURNS THAT OCCUR.
POD1000000031_S0000017	THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THOUGH IS THAT OFFERING THAT TYPE OF FREE FRICTIONLESS SEAMLESS RETURN POLICY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEPING CUSTOMERS.
POD1000000031_S0000018	DO YOU THINK WE AS CONSUMERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY HERE? I MEAN RETURNS ARE SO EASY, MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE FREE, THEY'RE MAYBE SOMETHING WE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD.
POD1000000031_S0000019	I THINK WE NEED TO INCUR SOME OF THE COSTS, FRANKLY. I DO THINK THAT THE FREE AND PAINLESS RETURN SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DEALING WITH IS LONG TERM NOT SUSTAINABLE.
POD1000000031_S0000020	SO I DO THINK IN SOME PLACE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW DAMAGING IT IS, NOT ONLY TO THE RETAILERS THAT WE'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH, BUT ALSO TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
POD1000000031_S0000021	YOU KNOW, ONE FACT THAT I FIND SHOCKING, FRANKLY, IS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE, FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF RETURN MERCHANDISE GETS PUT IN THE LANDFILL EVERY SINGLE YEAR, JUST IN THE US.
POD1000000031_S0000022	SO MERCHANDISE THAT'S BEEN HANDLED AND ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED BETWEEN THE POINT OF SALE TO THE RETURN POINT THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED WORTHLESS AND IT GETS THROWN AWAY. FIVE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR.
POD1000000031_S0000023	SO, I MEAN, IT'S JUST, IT'S A DESTRUCTIVE TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ALL TAKING PART IN. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO DO OUR PART TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.
POD1000000031_S0000024	AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO PAY FOR IT. AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING, THEY'LL BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THEY BEHAVE.
POD1000000031_S0000025	NOW THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT THE CONSUMERS HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF FREE AND FRICTIONLESS RETURNS AND HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL FIND SOMEONE IF YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO ME SOMEONE ELSE WILL.
POD1000000031_S0000026	SO, FIXING THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE THE FIRST RETAILER THAT'S GOING TO BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TURN AROUND AND SAY, SURE, WE'LL TAKE YOUR RETURNS, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COST YOU.
POD1000000031_S0000027	THAT WAS DAVID EGAN WITH CBRE.
POD1000000031_S0000029	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS.
POD1000000031_S0000030	IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT ONLINE SHOPPING WITHOUT MENTIONING THE BEHEMOTH THAT IS AMAZON. AS ADWEEK SAYS, WHERE IT GOES, OTHER RETAILERS FOLLOW.
POD1000000031_S0000031	AND IN THE LAST DECADE IT HAS SET NEW STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR DELIVERY, PUSHING ITS COMPETITORS TO DO THE SAME.
POD1000000031_S0000032	ADWEEK HAS THE FIVE WAYS WHICH AMAZON CHANGED SHOPPING IN THE 2010S.
POD1000000031_S0000033	WITH RETURNS OFTEN BEING FREE, IT'S REALLY NOT SURPRISING THAT CONSUMERS AREN'T AWARE OF THE REAL COSTS.
POD1000000031_S0000034	OR MAYBE WE JUST LIKE TO ASSUME OR HOPE THAT THOSE UNWANTED ITEMS THAT WE SO CAREFULLY RETURN WITH ALL THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGING INTACT ARE THEN RESTOCKED AND RESOLD.
POD1000000031_S0000035	THE IDEA THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF THEM END UP IN LANDFILL IS, AS THE LA TIMES CALLS IT, A HIDDEN ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS.
POD1000000031_S0000036	DAVID EGAN EXPLAINED THAT THE LOGISTICS OPERATION IS SET UP TO RUN SMOOTHLY IN ONE DIRECTION, GETTING THINGS TO US.
POD1000000031_S0000037	THERE ARE A LOT OF EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TOO THOUGH. THERE ARE COMPANIES MAKING IT THEIR BUSINESS TO HELP RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS.
POD1000000031_S0000038	SO IF YOU DO EVER STEP OUT FROM BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER AND ACTUALLY GO TO MALLS A LITTLE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ME, YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED SOME RETURN BARS WHERE YOU CAN DROP OFF PURCHASES AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE JUST DEAL WITH ALL THAT SENDING IT BACK STUFF FOR YOU.
POD1000000031_S0000039	AND FOR THE SELLERS, THESE COMPANIES PROMISE TO ANALYZE RETURNS AND THE REASONS FOR THEM, AND REDUCE THE PACKAGING THEY NEED. VOGUE BUSINESS BREAKS IT DOWN.
POD1000000031_S0000040	BUT I THINK REALLY THE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION THAT I'M TAKING AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS IS JUST TO BUY LESS STUFF. I'M JACK STEWART, AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH.
POD1000000031_S0000042	THIS IS APM.
POD1000000031_S0000043	HELLO TO 2020 AND TO ALL THE NEW MARKETPLACE INVESTORS WHO JOINED US BEFORE THE END OF THE DECADE.
POD1000000031_S0000044	THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THIS COMMUNITY OF DONORS WHO BELIEVE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUSTWORTHY, INDEPENDENT NEWS AND INFORMATION.
POD1000000031_S0000045	IT'S YOUR ONGOING SUPPORT THAT KEEPS US STRONG AND HELPS MAKE PEOPLE SMARTER EVERYWHERE. THANKS AGAIN AND HAPPY NEW YEAR.
POD1000000032_S0000001	THE US NEEDS A LOT MORE HOSPITAL BEDS FAST.
POD1000000032_S0000002	KENTEC, HELP US BUILD THEM.
POD1000000032_S0000003	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY.
POD1000000032_S0000004	I'M MOLLY WOOD.
POD1000000032_S0000006	STATES AND CITIES ARE RUSHING TO FIND HOSPITAL BEDS TO PREPARE FOR AN INCREASE IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM COVID 19.
POD1000000032_S0000007	IN NEW YORK, MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS ARE GOING UP IN CENTRAL PARK. A NAVY HOSPITAL SHIP IS IN THE CITY'S HARBOR.
POD1000000032_S0000008	ITS JAVITS CONVENTION CENTER HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A TEMPORARY MEDICAL FACILITY. AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS LOOKING TO CONVERT EMPTY HOTELS AND OTHER BUILDINGS INTO HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
POD1000000032_S0000009	NOW, AS PART OF ITS RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BUILT TWO GIANT HOSPITALS IN 10 DAYS.
POD1000000032_S0000010	AND WE WONDERED, COULD WE BUILD HOSPITALS THAT FAST HERE IN THE US? AND WHAT TECH EXISTS TO INNOVATE ON THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS?
POD1000000032_S0000011	CHRIS JETTINA IS WORKING ON IT. HE'S THE CEO OF THE MANUFACTURING AND DESIGN FIRM BLOCKS, WHICH SPECIALIZES IN MODULAR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION.
POD1000000032_S0000012	WE DELIVER ACUTE CARE FACILITIES. THINK ABOUT HOSPITALS. WE DESIGN THEM DIGITALLY AND WE MANUFACTURE THEM IN OUR PLANT.
POD1000000032_S0000013	AND IMAGINE A BIG COMPLEX LEGO THAT WE CAN SHIP OUT. AND THEN WHEN WE GET THERE, WE ASSEMBLE IT AS A COMPLETED BUILDING.
POD1000000032_S0000014	AND ALL OF THIS RELIES ON A BUNCH OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE, THE DIGITAL DESIGN AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE MACHINES THAT MAKE THESE PARTS REAL TOGETHER.
POD1000000032_S0000015	BUT AT THE END, WE TAKE RAW MATERIAL AND WE TURN IT INTO HOSPITALS.
POD1000000032_S0000016	AND ABOUT HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE?
POD1000000032_S0000017	A TYPICAL BUILDING MAY TAKE 12 TO 16 MONTHS TO MAKE.
POD1000000032_S0000018	AND WE DO IT IN FOUR MONTHS NOW. AND EVERY DAY WE HAVE A TEAM THAT'S WORKING TO MAKE IT FASTER AND FASTER.
POD1000000032_S0000019	YEAH, YOU KNOW, I ASKED THAT BECAUSE NO PRESSURE, BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME HEALTH CARE FACILITIES QUICKLY.
POD1000000032_S0000020	HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR COMPANY BEING A PART OF THAT?
POD1000000032_S0000021	SO A FEW WEEKS AGO, WHEN THE SIZE OF THIS PANDEMIC BECAME CLEAR,
POD1000000032_S0000022	OUR TEAM HAD TO REFOCUS. I MEAN, WE WERE MAKING PERMANENT HOSPITALS AND WE WERE DOING THEM REALLY FAST, BUT WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO TAKE THIS PROBLEM AND PUT IT THROUGH OUR MACHINE BLOCKS.
POD1000000032_S0000023	AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT SO THAT WE COULD GET HOSPITAL BEDS QUICKER.
POD1000000032_S0000024	WE SET OUT IMMEDIATELY TO DESIGN A 24 BED MICU.
POD1000000032_S0000025	YOU KNOW?
POD1000000032_S0000026	A MICU IS A MOBILE ISOLATION CARE UNIT. THIS MICU, IT'S GOT THREE JOBS.
POD1000000032_S0000027	AND THE FIRST ONE IS IT'S GOT TO PROTECT THE FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKER.
POD1000000032_S0000028	AND THEN THERE'S THIS SECOND THING THAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO, WHICH IS THEY'RE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE HOSPITAL'S EXISTING CAPACITY.
POD1000000032_S0000029	AND THEN THE FINAL ONE IS WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THESE MICUS BECOME A PERMANENT AND FLEXIBLE ASSET THAT HELPS SERVE THE HEALTH SYSTEM GOING FORWARD.
POD1000000032_S0000030	SO I MEAN, THEY'RE INSTITUTIONAL GRADE, THEY'RE REUSABLE.
POD1000000032_S0000031	IT'S A FLEET OF ICU ROOMS THAT GETS TO BE MOVED IN THE FUTURE TO WHEREVER THE HOT SPOT IS.
POD1000000032_S0000032	HOW MUCH DO THEY COST?
POD1000000032_S0000033	THESE THINGS WILL BE AROUND $200,000 TO $300,000 A BED IN THE BEGINNING, AND THEN THOSE PRICES WILL DROP DOWN.
POD1000000032_S0000034	SO THESE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE, BUT THEY'RE STILL HIGH TECH DEVICES THAT ARE CHOCK FULL OF EQUIPMENT AND PRESSURIZATION AND ELECTRONICS, AND THEY'RE STILL PRETTY EXPENSIVE BOXES.
POD1000000032_S0000035	CAN YOU TELL US AT ALL WHERE THESE PROJECTS MIGHT BE HAPPENING? LIKE WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING UP THESE MICKEYS?
POD1000000032_S0000036	WELL, WE'RE NOT PUTTING THEM UP YET, SO IT'S STILL GOING TO PRODUCTION IN TWO WEEKS.
POD1000000032_S0000037	THE FIRST ONES COULD BE IN ANY OF THE SPOTS THAT ARE NEEDED.
POD1000000032_S0000038	SO OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN IN PRETTY HEAVY DISCUSSIONS IN NEW YORK. WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS IN GEORGIA. AND THERE'S A BIG THERE'S A BIG DELTA BETWEEN THOSE TWO PLACES. BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO US WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED.
POD1000000032_S0000039	THEY CAN GO JUST AS EASILY TO ONE OR THE OTHER.
POD1000000032_S0000040	AND THEN JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, IS IT SORT OF LIKE A MODULAR HOUSE WHERE IT'S BASICALLY SORT OF PRE BUILT AND THEN IT JUST COMES ON A BIG TRUCK?
POD1000000032_S0000041	YOU KNOW, PARTS OF IT ARE. SO A LEGO ANALOGY IS REALLY A PRETTY GOOD ONE.
POD1000000032_S0000042	IF YOU THINK ABOUT A LEGO KIT OR ADVANCED ONE, IT HAS DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTS.
POD1000000032_S0000043	SOME OF THEM ARE VOLUMETRIC AND SOME OF THEM ARE CUSTOM PARTS AND SOME OF THEM ARE LITTLE PIECES THAT CAN BE USED IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS.
POD1000000032_S0000044	AND WE'RE AGNOSTIC ABOUT IT. WE THINK THAT THERE'S JUST A VALUE STREAM THAT GOES FROM RAW MATERIAL AND IT'S CONVERTED INTO A USABLE BUILDING.
POD1000000032_S0000045	AND THE PROCESS THAT IT GOES THROUGH IS A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT STAGES.
POD1000000032_S0000046	WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND AN OPTIMAL ONE.
POD1000000032_S0000047	THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A RIGHT PATH BECAUSE OF, IN FACT, WE'RE USING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO FOR A REGULAR HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW
POD1000000032_S0000048	BUT WE'VE MADE DIFFERENT CHANGES. THE FOUNDATION, FOR EXAMPLE, IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ON A MICU.
POD1000000032_S0000049	IT DOESN'T NEED ALL OF THE PERMANENCE THAT AN ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL MAY HAVE, YOU KNOW, THAT HAS A 50 YEAR LIFESPAN.
POD1000000032_S0000050	SO THE IDEA IS WE THINK OF IT AS COMPLETED PARTS, BUT EVERY PART'S COMPLETED.
POD1000000032_S0000051	AND IT GOES TOGETHER IN A FORM OF CHUNKING.
POD1000000032_S0000052	IT'S KIND OF THE WAY THEY BUILD THE NEW BOEING 787 DREAMLINER. IT'S NOT MADE ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE THE WAY YOU THINK OF AN ASSEMBLY LINE.
POD1000000032_S0000053	IT'S MADE IN CHUNKS THAT ARE MADE ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND THEY'VE ALL BROUGHT TOGETHER IN CHARLESTON AND PUT TOGETHER AS AN OEM IN A MATTER OF DAYS.
POD1000000032_S0000054	SO THAT'S MORE LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH BLOCKS.
POD1000000032_S0000055	GOT IT. WHAT MAKES THESE SPECIFIC TO MEDICAL FACILITIES?
POD1000000032_S0000056	WHAT KIND OF CERTIFICATION AND TECHNOLOGY GOES INTO THAT.
POD1000000032_S0000057	HOSPITALS ARE REALLY HEAVILY REGULATED.
POD1000000032_S0000058	AND IF YOU TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHICH ONES THERE ARE, IT'S A LONG LIST.
POD1000000032_S0000059	AND SO WHAT I WOULD JUST SIMPLY SAY IS THESE THINGS ARE DEALING WITH LIFE SAFETY AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. THEY'RE DEALING WITH EMERGENCY POWER, CRITICAL CARE OPERATIONS.
POD1000000032_S0000060	THEY'RE DEALING WITH TEMPERATURE CONTROL THAT'S BASED ON AIR EXCHANGES, WHICH ALLOW YOU TO EVACUATE DISEASE AND INFECTION.
POD1000000032_S0000061	THEY ARE DESIGNED TO BE VISIBLE AND OPERATIONAL HIGH PERFORMANCES, IF YOU WILL.
POD1000000032_S0000062	SO THESE NURSES AND DOCTORS ARE UNDER AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE.
POD1000000032_S0000063	AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A PLACE WHICH IS SAFE FOR THEM TO WORK, BUT VISUALLY CONTROLLED SO THEY CAN SEE EVERYTHING AT ONCE.
POD1000000032_S0000064	AND THAT'S WHAT WE FOCUSED ON. HOW DO WE MAKE THIS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL, ELEGANTLY SIMPLE, OPERATIONALLY VISUALLY CONTROLLED DEVICE THAT IS TECHNOLOGICALLY EMPOWERED?
POD1000000032_S0000065	AND CAN BE DEPLOYED REALLY FAST AND STILL BE DONE WITH THE STUFF THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY, NOT THE STUFF THAT WE WISH WAS AVAILABLE TODAY.
POD1000000032_S0000066	YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE A TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION TIME FOR A BUILDING FROM 12 TO 18 MONTHS DOWN TO FOUR MONTHS.
POD1000000032_S0000067	HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO CONSTRUCT THESE MICUS?
POD1000000032_S0000068	SO, THE FIRST ONE WILL ROLL OFF IN JUNE, THE END OF MAY, AND IT'LL BE OPERATIONAL A WEEK LATER.
POD1000000032_S0000069	AND THEN AFTER THAT, THEY'LL JUST KEEP COMING AS LONG AS THEY'RE NEEDED.
POD1000000032_S0000070	SO ONCE THE LINE IS LOADED, THEN THINK OF IT AS JUST A CONTINUOUS RIVER THAT KEEPS DROPPING THEM OUT.
POD1000000032_S0000071	SO THERE'S ABOUT 10 LARGE MODULES IN EACH ONE OF THESE AND EVERY DAY AND A HALF ANOTHER 10 WILL BE READY TO BE SHIPPED.
POD1000000032_S0000072	LET ME ASK YOU THIS, IT'S CLEARLY A TECHNOLOGICAL MIRACLE IN A LOT OF WAYS.
POD1000000032_S0000073	JUNE IS A LONG WAYS AWAY. DO YOU WISH THAT YOU HAD STARTED GETTING CALLS SOONER?
POD1000000032_S0000075	YES. NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION, AND I THINK THAT WE'RE, AS A NATION, IN THE MIDST OF A NECESSITY.
POD1000000032_S0000076	I LIKE WHAT I SEE IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT COMING TOGETHER TO TRY AND SOLVE HARD PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.
POD1000000032_S0000077	CHRIS JETTINA IS CEO OF THE MODULAR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION FIRM, BLOX.
POD1000000032_S0000078	HE SAID THE COMPANY IS TALKING RIGHT NOW WITH A FEW STATES ABOUT BUILDING THE MICUS HE MENTIONED.
POD1000000032_S0000079	BUT SO FAR HASN'T FINALIZED ANY DEALS.
POD1000000032_S0000081	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS TO THAT POINT ABOUT WHETHER BLOCKS IS ALREADY BUILDING FACILITIES.
POD1000000032_S0000082	FAST COMPANY HAS A PIECE ON HOW, YES, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE MODULAR CONSTRUCTION EXPERTISE TO GET BUILDINGS UP QUICKLY,
POD1000000032_S0000083	BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF LOGISTICS AND RED TAPE PROBLEMS.
POD1000000032_S0000084	THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, AS YOU HEARD, WANTS TO CONVERT EXISTING FACILITIES
POD1000000032_S0000085	BUT FOR THE REASONS THAT JATINA MENTIONED, A HOTEL OR CONVENTION CENTER IS NOT IDEAL FOR THE JOB. THOSE BUILDINGS ARE HARD TO STERILIZE.
POD1000000032_S0000086	THEY NEED HVAC SYSTEMS THAT CAN PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES FROM BEING PUMPED INTO EVERY ROOM. AND THEY HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER MEDICAL NEEDS AS WELL.
POD1000000032_S0000087	THE PIECE POINTS TO SOME MODULAR DESIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE CREATING MEDICAL PODS THAT CAN BE BUILT QUICKLY,
POD1000000032_S0000088	SOME OTHERS IN ADDITION TO BLOCKS.
POD1000000032_S0000089	BUT SINCE EACH CITY AND STATE HAS ITS OWN RULES AROUND CONSTRUCTION AND PERMITS, AND EVEN JUST A SHORTAGE OF ACTUAL LAND TO PUT MODULES ON,
POD1000000032_S0000090	IT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM TO SOLVE QUICKLY, AT A TIME WHEN SPEED IS WHAT WE NEED.
POD1000000032_S0000092	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING IN TECH.
POD1000000032_S0000093	THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTS THAT, NO SURPRISE, THE U.S. IS ALREADY STARTING TO TRACK PEOPLE'S SMARTPHONE DATA TO ANALYZE MOVEMENTS AND ULTIMATELY BUILD A DATABASE THAT CAN SHOW, AT A NATIONAL LEVEL,
POD1000000032_S0000094	HOW WELL SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES ARE WORKING, AND WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT BE GATHERING TOGETHER IN LARGE GROUPS SO THAT AUTHORITIES CAN BOTH CRACK DOWN AND POTENTIALLY PREDICT A FUTURE OUTBREAK.
POD1000000032_S0000095	AND LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS LATER IN THE WEEK, THIS NEED FOR A DATA DRIVEN RESPONSE TO THIS OUTBREAK AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS USEFUL EXISTING DATA.
POD1000000032_S0000096	AND THE FACT THAT IT IS ALSO LIKELY TO BECOME A PRIVACY INVASION AT A GRAND SCALE.
POD1000000032_S0000097	TECHCRUNCH HAS A PIECE ABOUT HOW SINGAPORE IS COLLECTING DATA IN A MORE PRIVACY FRIENDLY WAY THROUGH AN APP CALLED TRACETOGETHER.
POD1000000032_S0000098	THAT'S WHAT MIT IS TRYING TO DO WITH ITS APP, SAFE PATHS. BUT BOTH CASES RELY ON PEOPLE DOWNLOADING THE APP AND USING IT AND VOLUNTARILY REPORTING INFORMATION.
POD1000000032_S0000099	IN SINGAPORE, THERE IS A MORE CENTRAL AUTHORITY THAT CAN MAKE PEOPLE DO THE THING.
POD1000000032_S0000100	THAT'S A LOT HARDER IN THE US, AND SINCE THE DATA ALREADY EXISTS IN ONE GIANT COOKIE JAR FULL OF DELICIOUS QUARANTINE BAKED COOKIES,
POD1000000032_S0000101	IT'S GONNA BE REAL HARD TO CONVINCE THE COOKIE MONSTER TO FIND ANOTHER TREAT.

POD1000000034_S0000005	I'M KIMBERLY ADAMS, IN FOR MOLLY WOOD.
POD1000000034_S0000007	AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, MANY OF US ARE DOING MORE ONLINE SHOPPING AND RELYING ON AMAZON MORE THAN EVER. AMAZON HAS HIRED ABOUT 80,000 NEW WORKERS TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND,
POD1000000034_S0000008	AND FOLLOWING EMPLOYEE WALKOUTS AND PROTESTS, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THURSDAY IT WOULD START TAKING EMPLOYEES' TEMPERATURES AT WORK AND PROVIDE FACE MASKS.
POD1000000034_S0000009	AMAZON IN THE ERA OF COVID 19 IS THE TOPIC FOR THIS WEEK'S QUALITY ASSURANCE, WHERE WE TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT A BIG STORY IN THE NEWS. MATT DAY COVERS AMAZON FOR BLOOMBERG.
POD1000000034_S0000010	AND WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THE COMPANY FIT INTO THAT NOW CRUCIAL DESIGNATION OF ESSENTIAL.
POD1000000034_S0000011	OBVIOUSLY A GOOD DEAL OF AMAZON IS KIND OF ESSENTIAL IN THESE TIMES, PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WITH MOBILITY ISSUES, YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO FOR HEALTH REASONS DOESN'T WANT TO EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF GOING TO A SUPERMARKET OR BIG BOX STORE THAT REMAINS OPEN, YOU'RE RELIANT ON E COMMERCE.
POD1000000034_S0000012	ON THAT REGARD, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET DRY GOODS OR HAND SANITIZER OR WIPES, CHANCES ARE YOU'RE USING AMAZON.COM. BUT ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS THAT WE FOUND OF THIS ENVIRONMENT, AT LEAST IF YOU TALK TO AMAZON'S WORKERS, IS THAT THEY'RE STILL SHIPPING A LOT OF NON ESSENTIAL STUFF.
POD1000000034_S0000013	AMAZON'S DIGITAL DOORS REMAIN OPEN FOR BOOKS, FOR TOYS, GAMES, FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SELLING ONLINE ANYWAY. THEY'RE STILL SHIPPING THAT. AND THERE'S WORKERS IN FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY STILL RISKING THEIR OWN HEALTH GOING INTO WORK.
POD1000000034_S0000014	IN THE SERVICE OF MOVING THOSE GOODS TO YOUR DOOR TOO.
POD1000000034_S0000015	WE'RE TALKING ABOUT E COMMERCE BUT AMAZON ALSO HAS A LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES RIGHT.
POD1000000034_S0000016	RIGHT, RIGHT. AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER AREAS THAT THEY STAND TO LIKELY BENEFIT FROM THIS. ONE OF THEM, IT DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT QUITE AS MUCH AS DELIVERY, BUT AMAZON WEB SERVICES, THEIR CLOUD COMPUTING GROUP, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY ON DEMAND SOFTWARE OR PROCESSING POWER.
POD1000000034_S0000017	BUSINESSES WITH EMPLOYEES WORKING FROM HOME ARE MAKING MORE USE OF THAT, ANALYSTS SAY. AND THEN IF YOU'RE SITTING AT HOME WATCHING NETFLIX OR USING A VARIETY OF INTERNET SERVICES, A LOT OF THE BACKBONES OF THOSE LIVE ON AMAZON WEB SERVICES.
POD1000000034_S0000018	IT'S KIND OF THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT THEY STAND TO GAIN TOO FROM THIS ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW.
POD1000000034_S0000019	YOU KNOW, SO MANY OF OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE COME OUT OF THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD TO EVEN ENVISION WHEN THAT IS OR WHAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AT THAT POINT.
POD1000000034_S0000020	BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT AMAZON A YEAR FROM NOW, WHAT KIND OF STORIES DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE WRITING ABOUT THIS COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS?
POD1000000034_S0000021	I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE WRITING ABOUT HOW THIS, AS CATASTROPHIC AN EVENT AS IT'S PROVING TO BE GLOBALLY, THIS IS KIND OF THE THING THAT AMAZON WAS BUILT FOR. THEY'VE SPENT MOST OF THE LAST DECADE BUILDING A GIANT LOGISTICS NETWORK IN THE US AND PARTS OF EUROPE.
POD1000000034_S0000022	REALLY IN AN UNPRECEDENTED WAY GET GOODS TO YOU QUICKER AND TO EVERY DOORSTEP THEY CAN ACCESS. THEY'VE BEEN TOUTING E COMMERCE SINCE THAT TERM WAS NEW. SO I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS THEY ARE A COMPANY BUILT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.
POD1000000034_S0000023	NOW IT HASN'T BEEN A GLORIOUS COUPLE OF MONTHS FOR THEM. THEY'VE HAD SOME COMPLAINTS FROM WORKERS ABOUT NON ESSENTIAL GOODS AND THE RATE AT WHICH THEY'VE BEEN WORKED. THERE'S BEEN THE USUAL CRITICISMS FROM US SENATORS ABOUT GIVING WORKERS BETTER PAY.
POD1000000034_S0000024	HAS BEEN AN ISSUE AT AMAZON OFF AND ON FOR A WHILE. BUT TO A LARGE EXTENT, THIS COMPANY WAS DESIGNED TO HANDLE THESE KIND OF CHALLENGES. SO I THINK IF THIS INDEED MEANS A SORT OF PERMANENT INCREASE IN ONLINE COMMERCE, AMAZON WOULD STAND TO GAIN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM IT.
POD1000000034_S0000025	AND THEN THE QUESTION IS JUST WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT, YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEIR BUSINESS LEADERS WOULD HOPE, OR IF SOME OF THE PR BACKLASH RELATED TO SOME OF THESE CONTROVERSIES HAMPERS THEM.
POD1000000034_S0000026	WE HAVE SEEN PROTESTS THIS WEEK BY DELIVERY WORKERS AND PEOPLE WORKING IN AMAZON'S WAREHOUSES. WILL THIS HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS?
POD1000000034_S0000027	THE ISSUE WITH AMAZON, IT'S BEEN A COMPLICATED STORY FOR A LONG TIME, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THIS CRISIS IS DOING IS SOME OF THOSE FOLKS ARE KIND OF TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE. THERE WAS A WALKOUT IN AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE JUST OUTSIDE OF DETROIT.
POD1000000034_S0000028	IT WAS THE THIRD WALKOUT IN THREE DAYS AT AN AMAZON FACILITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN.
POD1000000034_S0000029	SO CLEARLY, WORKERS WHO FEEL UNDER EXTREME AMOUNTS OF PRESSURE THEMSELVES THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO MAYBE ASK THINGS OF MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT UNDER SORT OF BUSINESS AS USUAL CONDITIONS.
POD1000000034_S0000030	BLOOMBERG'S MATT DAY. AMAZON ALSO SAYS IT'S NO LONGER GOING TO SELL N95 MASKS AND OTHER URGENTLY NEEDED COVID 19 RELATED SUPPLIES TO REGULAR CUSTOMERS.
POD1000000034_S0000031	THE COMPANY HAS A NEW SECTION OF ITS WEBSITE JUST FOR THESE PRODUCTS AND SAYS IT WILL PRIORITIZE THEM FOR HOSPITALS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
POD1000000034_S0000033	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS. MATT DAY RECENTLY WROTE ABOUT AMAZON'S SURGE IN HIRING TO MEET ALL THE DEMAND FROM PEOPLE STUCK AT HOME DUE TO CORONAVIRUS.
POD1000000034_S0000034	AND SOME OF THAT HIRING LAST MONTH WAS HAPPENING AT JOB FAIRS, WHERE PEOPLE WEREN'T EXACTLY ABLE TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING.
POD1000000034_S0000035	AMAZON SAID IT'S SINCE UPDATED ITS RECRUITING STRATEGIES TO, ACCORDING TO MATT'S REPORTS, KEEP APPLICANTS SAFE.
POD1000000034_S0000037	AND MY COLLEAGUE ANDY UHLER COVERED THOSE AMAZON PROTESTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.
POD1000000034_S0000038	AND SPEAKING OF SAFETY, INSTACART SAYS IT'S GOING TO START PROVIDING FULL SERVICE SHOPPERS WITH A SAFETY KIT, INCLUDING A MASK, HAND SANITIZER AND A THERMOMETER.
POD1000000034_S0000039	SHOPPERS HAVE TO REQUEST THE KITS, BUT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE. YOU CAN FIND THE LINKS TO ALL THESE STORIES AT MARKETPLACE.ORG.
POD1000000034_S0000041	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING. AFTER YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS, A BUNCH OF LAWSUITS, A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOBBYING AND SOME EXTRA STAYS AT THE TRUMP HOTEL,
POD1000000034_S0000042	THE MERGER BETWEEN T MOBILE AND SPRINT IS FINALLY DONE. THAT DEAL IS WORTH ABOUT $26 BILLION AND LEAVES US WITH JUST THREE BIG WIRELESS NETWORKS. AT&T, VERIZON, AND T MOBILE AND NO ONE ELSE.
POD1000000034_S0000043	STEPHANIE HUGHES PRODUCES MARKETPLACE TECH, JESUS ALVARADO IS OUR ASSISTANT PRODUCER, JODY BECKER IS OUR SENIOR EDITOR, AND ROBIN EDGAR IS OUR ENGINEER. I'M KIMBERLY ADAMS, AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH.
POD1000000034_S0000045	THIS IS APM.
POD1000000035_S0000001	HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR UNEMPLOYMENT ARE EXPOSING AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM IN STATES.
POD1000000035_S0000002	REALLY, REALLY OLD TECHNOLOGY.
POD1000000035_S0000003	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. I'M MOLLY WOOD.
POD1000000035_S0000005	NEW JERSEY'S GOVERNOR RECENTLY WENT ON TV ASKING FOR VOLUNTEERS WHO KNOW COBOL, A MORE THAN 60 YEAR OLD COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
POD1000000035_S0000006	THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT SYSTEM RUNS ON A DECADES OLD MAINFRAME THAT CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE VOLUME OF REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL HELP.
POD1000000035_S0000007	AND NEW JERSEY ISN'T ALONE. SEVERAL STATES, NOT TO MENTION LOTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ARE ALL AT THE MERCY OF THESE VERY OLD SYSTEMS RUNNING ON A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT ISN'T EVEN TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS ANYMORE.
POD1000000035_S0000008	JOSEPH STEINBERG IS A CYBERSECURITY CONSULTANT AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK CYBERSECURITIES FOR DUMMIES.
POD1000000035_S0000009	WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT USE MAINFRAMES WITH COBOL FOR BACK END PROCESSING OF TRANSACTIONS AND BATCH PROCESSING.
POD1000000035_S0000010	I THINK THEY PROBABLY HAVE THINGS IN A LOT BETTER SHAPE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES IN HOUSE.
POD1000000035_S0000011	IN SOME CASES THEY'VE REPLACED THE SYSTEMS AT GREAT EXPENSE OVER RECENT YEARS, IN SOME CASES THEY'RE DOING IT NOW.
POD1000000035_S0000012	AND IN SOME CASES THEY'VE MADE THE DECISIONS TO ACTUALLY TRAIN PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE SYSTEMS GOING FORWARD.
POD1000000035_S0000013	BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT, AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY EVEN WORSE IN THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THAN IN THE FEDERAL,
POD1000000035_S0000014	YOU HAVE MANY SYSTEMS THAT SEEM TO HANG AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
POD1000000035_S0000015	ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I POSED IN THE LAST WEEK IS SIMPLY IF, GOD FORBID, THIS PANDEMIC CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MORE MONTHS AND ALL AMERICANS HAD TO VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REMOTELY,
POD1000000035_S0000016	HMM.
POD1000000035_S0000017	DO ALL 50 STATES ACTUALLY HAVE COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE THAT VOLUME OF BALLOTS GOING OUT AND IN TO BE COUNTED, PROCESSED IN A SECURE FASHION, IN ANY REASONABLE TIME FRAME?
POD1000000035_S0000018	AND I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION MIGHT BE. WE SIMPLY HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY SYSTEMS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS STATE PROCESSES AND THEY ARE NOT MEANT, THEY WERE NEVER DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE MASS LOADS THAT COULD SUDDENLY HAPPEN NOW.
POD1000000035_S0000019	HMM.
POD1000000035_S0000020	AND IT'S A LOT HARDER TO SCALE THESE LEGACY SYSTEMS.
POD1000000035_S0000021	NEWER TECHNOLOGIES SCALE MUCH BETTER AND I'M AFRAID OF WHAT'S OUT THERE YOU KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL.
POD1000000035_S0000022	AND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT YOU KNOW, AFTER THIS PANDEMIC IS OVER, IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE TIME TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE OLDER SYSTEMS AND EVALUATE WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE RELIABLE ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD TO MAKE CHANGES OR THEY'RE REALLY RELIABLE.
POD1000000035_S0000023	AND I THINK IN MANY CASES WE'LL FIND IT'S THE FORMER.
POD1000000035_S0000024	RIGHT. I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS SORT OF AN INVISIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM IN AMERICA THAT IN SOME WAYS IS AS EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO FIX AS ROADS AND BRIDGES.
POD1000000035_S0000025	IT'S AS EXPENSIVE AND PERHAPS IN SOME WAYS MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T NOTICE IT UNTIL THE PROBLEM HAPPENS.
POD1000000035_S0000026	YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED MONEY BECAUSE THEIR WORK SUDDENLY ENDED, THEY PLACE AN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM AND THEY CAN'T GET IT PROCESSED.
POD1000000035_S0000027	THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS. PEOPLE COULD BE LOW ON FOOD AND OTHER SUPPLIES AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAN EASILY OBTAIN THEM NOW EITHER.
POD1000000035_S0000028	AND I THINK THAT'S PRECISELY THE ISSUE WITH THESE OLDER SYSTEMS.
POD1000000035_S0000029	OFTEN WE ASSUME THAT THEY'RE RELIABLE UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE AND THE PROBLEM HAS HIT. AND AT THAT POINT, YOU'VE GOT A TACTICAL PROBLEM. HOW DO WE PROCESS THESE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS?
POD1000000035_S0000030	AND A STRATEGIC PROBLEM, HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE?
POD1000000035_S0000031	YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO BRING A LOT OF PROGRAMMERS OUT OF RETIREMENT, THAT THESE SYSTEMS SIMPLY MAY NOT EVER BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE LOAD THAT IS BEING PUT ON THEM NOW.
POD1000000035_S0000032	IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO SCALE THEM UP WITH IMPROVED HARDWARE, BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE, NUMBER ONE.
POD1000000035_S0000033	AND THEY DON'T SCALE AS SIMPLY AS MORE MODERN SYSTEMS DO. SO, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HIRING PROGRAMMERS OUT OF RETIREMENT AND PEOPLE DON'T LIVE FOREVER.
POD1000000035_S0000034	YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF PROGRAMMERS WHO PROGRAMMED IN THE 70S IN THE WORKFORCE.
POD1000000035_S0000035	AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THESE SYSTEMS AREN'T RELIABLE. THEY MAY BE VERY RELIABLE FOR WHAT THEY DO NOW.
POD1000000035_S0000036	HMM.
POD1000000035_S0000037	BUT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SYSTEMS MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED AND MAY NEED TO SCALE UP SUDDENLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN RESOURCES.
POD1000000035_S0000038	I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN AT COMPANIES THAT REPLATFORMED AND IT IS HARD AND IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE. AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AT A SORT OF STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL? WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF BOTH TECHNOLOGY AND MONEY WOULD THAT TAKE?
POD1000000035_S0000039	THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THERE'S ALSO A POLITICAL PROBLEM WITH THINGS LIKE THIS.
POD1000000035_S0000040	YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A STATE ELECTED OFFICIAL AND YOU HAVE TO BUDGET A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR REPLACING A SYSTEM, NO USER OF THAT SYSTEM INITIALLY BENEFITS FROM IT.
POD1000000035_S0000041	SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL, WHICH I THINK AFTER THIS WE WILL, TO INVEST THE MONEY BEFORE PROBLEMS HAPPEN, UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE.
POD1000000035_S0000042	WE SHOULD HAVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SET UP THAT IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE DYING, THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON PEOPLE, NOT ON TECHNICAL GLITCHES IN AN UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM.
POD1000000035_S0000043	RIGHT. THIS IS SPECULATIVE AND A VAGUELY NIGHTMARE SCENARIO, BUT AT WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK COMPANIES
POD1000000035_S0000045	LIKE AN AMAZON OR MICROSOFT OR GOOGLE MIGHT APPROACH STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SAY MAYBE YOU NEED A PRIVATE SOLUTION, A PRIVATIZED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SOME OF THIS.
POD1000000035_S0000047	I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ALREADY HAVE. THEY MAY HAVE APPROACHED THEM YEARS AGO AND BEEN TOLD THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING, WE HAVE NO NEED TO REPLACE IT. I DON'T KNOW.
POD1000000035_S0000048	BUT I'M SURE THAT AFTER THIS IS ALL OVER, AS THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF SAID, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A POST MORTEM.
POD1000000035_S0000049	AND THEN AFTER THAT POSTMORTEM, THERE'S GOING TO BE EVALUATIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AS TO HOW TO PROCEED, AND SOME OF THOSE WILL INVOLVE UTILIZING THIRD PARTY RESOURCES POTENTIALLY.
POD1000000035_S0000050	BY THE WAY, YOU COULD HAVE A CLOUD THAT'S RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT. IT COULD BE A PRIVATE CLOUD SYSTEM. IT COULD BE THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE.
POD1000000035_S0000051	YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY MANY OPTIONS BUT MOVING AWAY FROM THE COBOL CODE RUNNING ON THE MAINFRAME TO A MORE MODERN PLATFORM MIGHT ALLOW FOR GREATER SCALABILITY SUDDENLY IF NEEDED, AS WELL AS FOR EASIER MAINTENANCE IF CODE CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE.
POD1000000035_S0000052	YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO NEED TO GO BEGGING FOR PROGRAMMERS AT A PRESS CONFERENCE.
POD1000000035_S0000054	JOSEPH STEINBERG IS A CYBERSECURITY CONSULTANT.
POD1000000035_S0000056	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS. WE'VE GOT A LINK TO THAT 2016 REPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, WHICH FOUND THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE USES 8 INCH FLOPPY DISKS TO COORDINATE SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR FORCES.
POD1000000035_S0000057	YOU CAN SEE WHY THEY WANT TO GET THAT BIG CLOUD PROJECT MOVING, I GUESS.
POD1000000035_S0000058	IN OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEWS, MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW HAS A PIECE THIS WEEK ABOUT HOW, GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE INTERNET IS HOLDING UP SHOCKINGLY WELL IN THE MIDST OF OUR BIG TRANSITION FROM WORK AND SCHOOL TO HOME.
POD1000000035_S0000059	IT POINTS OUT THAT CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ALSO STREAMING MEDIA AND TELECOM COMPANIES
POD1000000035_S0000060	SO THINK AMAZON OR COMCAST, NETFLIX, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE. THEY ALL PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO NEW INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO IN ORDER TO KEEP DELIVERING THEIR SERVICES.
POD1000000035_S0000061	AND NOW THIS CURRENT CRISIS IS GENERATING EVEN MORE INVESTMENT.
POD1000000035_S0000062	NOW IF ONLY WE COULD DO THE SAME FOR THE POWER GRID AND THE BRIDGES AND THE STATE AND COUNTY MAINFRAMES.
POD1000000035_S0000064	AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE WATCHING IN TECH. A BERUDOL WEEK AT YELP.
POD1000000035_S0000065	THE COMPANY THAT IS BASICALLY BUILT ON SMALL BUSINESSES IS LAYING OFF 1,000 PEOPLE AND FURLOUGHING ANOTHER 1,100, ACCORDING TO AXIOS.
POD1000000035_S0000066	YELP'S CEO WILL TAKE NO SALARY FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR, AND THE COMPANY IS CUTTING EXECUTIVE PAY BY 20 TO 30 PERCENT.
POD1000000035_S0000068	ALSO ON THURSDAY, MICROSOFT RELEASED A REPORT ABOUT REMOTE WORK TRENDS BASED ON DATA FROM ITS TEAMS PRODUCT.
POD1000000035_S0000069	THE COMPANY, OF COURSE, REPORTED A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING TEAMS.
POD1000000035_S0000070	BUT THE REPORT HAS SOME SUPER INTERESTING DATA.
POD1000000035_S0000071	FOR EXAMPLE, IT NOTES THAT PEOPLE ARE USING VIDEO IN THEIR MEETINGS A LOT MORE THAN THEY EVER DID BEFORE.
POD1000000035_S0000072	A THOUSAND PERCENT MORE IN MARCH, IN FACT.
POD1000000035_S0000073	BUT THE U.S. LAGS A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF VIDEO CALLING.
POD1000000035_S0000074	IN NORWAY AND THE NETHERLANDS, ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF CALLS INCLUDE VIDEO, BUT ONLY 38 PERCENT OF AMERICAN MEETINGS HAVE THE CAMERA TURNED ON.
POD1000000035_S0000075	I MEAN, LISTEN, I'M JUST GOING TO CONFESS THAT I STRAIGHT UP REFUSED TO JOIN A MEETING BY VIDEO ON THURSDAY BECAUSE I, FOR ONE, CAN NO LONGER STAND THE SIGHT OF MY OWN FOREHEAD.
POD1000000035_S0000076	I SEE YOU AMERICA, OR RATHER, I ONLY HEAR YOU.
POD1000000035_S0000077	STEPHANIE HUGHES PRODUCES MARKETPLACE TECH. JESUS ALVARADO IS OUR ASSISTANT PRODUCER. JODY BECKER IS OUR SENIOR EDITOR. ROBIN EDGAR IS OUR ENGINEER. I'M MOLLIE WOOD AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
POD1000000035_S0000078	THIS IS APM.
POD1000000036_S0000001	FACEBOOK USERS IN ILLINOIS COULD EACH BE IN LINE FOR A COUPLE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PRIVACY VIOLATIONS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE REST OF US?
POD1000000036_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH, DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, I'M JACK STEWART, IN FOR MOLLY WOOD.
POD1000000036_S0000004	ABOUT A DECADE AGO, FACEBOOK STARTED AUTOMATICALLY TAGGING PEOPLE WHOSE FACES ITS ALGORITHMS HAD RECOGNISED IN OUR UPLOADED PHOTOS. AT THE TIME IT SEEMED LIKE MAGIC.
POD1000000036_S0000005	BUT THIS WEEK, FACEBOOK HAS AGREED TO PAY $550 MILLION OVER CLAIMS THAT TOOL VIOLATED PRIVACY RIGHTS. THE SETTLEMENT IS IN ILLINOIS, WHICH HAS STRICT LAWS PROTECTING BIOMETRIC DATA.
POD1000000036_S0000006	FACEBOOK REVEALED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AT THE SAME TIME AS ITS QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS THIS WEEK. AND THEY, BY THE WAY, SHOWED THAT REVENUE WAS UP 25% TO $21 BILLION AT THE END OF LAST YEAR.
POD1000000036_S0000007	FOR TODAY'S QUALITY ASSURANCE, WE HAVE NATASHA SINGH, A TECH REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS SETTLEMENT MEANS.
POD1000000036_S0000008	SO, ILLINOIS HAS THE TOUGHEST BIOMETRIC PRIVACY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE ONLY THREE STATES THAT HAVE THESE KIND OF LAWS.
POD1000000036_S0000009	AND SO BIOMETRIC PRIVACY PERTAINS TO YOUR FINGERPRINTS OR FACIAL SCANS FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION. AND SO IN ILLINOIS, THE LAW SAYS THAT COMPANIES CAN'T COLLECT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION, LIKE FACIAL DATA FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION, WITHOUT GETTING WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM SOMEONE.
POD1000000036_S0000010	AND ALSO, THEY CAN'T COLLECT THE DATA WITHOUT TELLING SOMEBODY HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP IT. AND SO, FACEBOOK USERS IN ILLINOIS SUED FACEBOOK SAYING THAT IT HAD COLLECTED THEIR FACIAL INFORMATION AND HAD NOT OBTAINED THEIR KIND OF AFFIRMATIVE OPT IN PERMISSION AND HAD NOT TOLD THEM HOW LONG THAT FACEBOOK WAS GOING TO KEEP IT.
POD1000000036_S0000011	FACEBOOK SAYS THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE NOT TRUE, BUT FACEBOOK SAID THAT IT SETTLED THIS LAWSUIT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO, YOU KNOW, DRAG ON AND TAKE UP TOO MUCH RESOURCES AND IT WAS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY AND THE STOCKHOLDERS IF THEY SETTLED THE LAWSUIT.
POD1000000036_S0000012	DO YOU THINK THE SIZE OF THIS FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT MIGHT SERVE AS A WARNING TO OTHER COMPANIES WHO ARE CONSIDERING THIS SORT OF TECHNOLOGY?
POD1000000036_S0000013	IT FEELS LIKE MAYBE WHEN FACEBOOK INTRODUCED THINGS LIKE FACIAL RECOGNITION, THEY WERE JUST LOOKING AT FUN WAYS OF USING IT, AND MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER IMPLICATIONS ARE NOW COMING TO LIGHT.
POD1000000036_S0000014	IF YOU THINK ABOUT A FACE PRINT, IT'S LIKE THE FACIAL EQUIVALENT OF YOUR FINGERPRINT. AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE YOUR FINGERPRINT FOR FUN WAYS.
POD1000000036_S0000015	BUT WE KIND OF VISCERALLY KNOW THAT YOUR FINGERPRINT HAS ALL KINDS OF IMPLICATIONS AND IT'S UNIQUE. SO EVEN THE NOTION OF FACEBOOK TURNING ON FACIAL RECOGNITION BY DEFAULT FOR FUN THINGS IS PROBLEMATIC, FIRST OF ALL, IN ILLINOIS,
POD1000000036_S0000016	BUT ALSO TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PROBLEM WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION IS THAT IT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE AT A DISTANCE.
POD1000000036_S0000017	AND SO IT IMPLICATES YOUR ABILITY TO BE ANONYMOUS BOTH ONLINE AND IN PUBLIC.
POD1000000036_S0000018	DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE WE'LL SEE COMPANIES BASICALLY DEFAULTING TO JUST NOT COLLECTING ANY DATA LIKE THIS AT THE RISK OF IT SOMEHOW BEING REGULATED IN THE FUTURE?
POD1000000036_S0000019	CERTAINLY, I THINK COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVING SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY AND THEY HAVE ILLINOIS USERS MUST BE THINKING ABOUT IT, RIGHT? BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE DOORBELL CAMS, WHICH ARE SPREADING EVERYWHERE.
POD1000000036_S0000020	WELL, YOUR DOORBELL CAMERA IS GOING TO TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE AND IT'S USED FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION, RIGHT? SO THAT LIKE IT CAN RECOGNIZE YOUR BABYSITTER SO THAT THEY CAN COME IN. IN ILLINOIS, YOU NEED CONSENT FOR STUFF LIKE THAT.
POD1000000036_S0000021	AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ALL KINDS OF DEVICES THAT COLLECT AMBIENT BIOMETRIC DATA? I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT. I THINK THAT COMPANIES NOW, BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT, ARE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEIR ILLINOIS PLAN IS.
POD1000000036_S0000022	I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ONE SET OF SOFTWARE FOR ILLINOIS AND ANOTHER FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S JUST FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE INEFFICIENT.
POD1000000036_S0000023	BUT SECOND OF ALL, YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SAYING, WELL, YOU TURNED THAT OFF FOR ILLINOIS. WHY HAVEN'T YOU TURNED IT OFF FOR US?
POD1000000036_S0000024	AND SO WE'RE SEEING, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW, THAT OUR NUMBER OF COMPANIES, MICROSOFT, APPLE, HAVE SAID, WE'RE GOING TO HONOR THE RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW FOR EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES.
POD1000000036_S0000025	IT FEELS LIKE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE PRIVACY STORIES, WE TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF YOUR PRIVACY OR THE VALUE OF YOUR DATA, AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY HARD TO PUT A NUMBER ON THAT.
POD1000000036_S0000026	DO YOU THINK THINGS LIKE THIS ILLINOIS SETTLEMENT ARE STARTING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND PUTTING A DOLLAR VALUE ON THESE THINGS?
POD1000000036_S0000027	SO I THINK THE NOTION THAT THERE'S A TRADE AND YOU'RE TRADING YOUR DATA FOR SERVICES AND SO YOU'RE GIVING UP SOME OF YOUR PRIVACY IS THE SILICON VALLEY FRAMING THAT YOU'RE GETTING VALUE FOR DATA.
POD1000000036_S0000028	BUT WHEN WE THINK OF A TRADE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GIVING UP AND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING. BUT WHEN YOU GIVE UP YOUR DATA, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT'S GOING TO BE USED.
POD1000000036_S0000029	IT CAN BE USED PERENNIALLY FOR ALL TIME FOR ALL KINDS OF PURPOSES FOR WHICH YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT A TRADE. IT'S NOT A FAIR TRADE. AND I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT DATA IS NOT PROPERTY.
POD1000000036_S0000030	IN EUROPE, SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. AND IF WE THINK OF OTHER FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS LIKE THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH, YOU WOULDN'T SAY I'M TRADING MY FREE SPEECH FOR FACEBOOK SERVICES.
POD1000000036_S0000031	SO THIS NOTION THAT WE'RE TRADING OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY FOR SERVICES, I THINK IS JUST A PROBLEMATIC FRAMING.
POD1000000036_S0000033	FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES. ACCORDING TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE, A FEDERAL COURT JUDGE MUST APPROVE THE FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT.
POD1000000036_S0000034	AND THEN MEMBERS OF THE CLASS ACTION
POD1000000036_S0000036	CLAIMS FOR PART OF THE MONEY.
POD1000000036_S0000038	FOR SOME RELATED LINKS TODAY, CHECK OUT NATASHA'S STORY AT THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE SETTLEMENT AND NEXT STEPS, AS WELL AS COVERAGE FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE FOR MORE ON WHY ILLINOIS HAS BECOME SO IMPORTANT FOR PRIVACY LAWSUITS.
POD1000000036_S0000039	AND THEN IF YOU DIDN'T READ IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WELL, SET ASIDE A GOOD FEW MINUTES TO COMPLETELY DIGEST THE NEW YORK TIMES STORY, THE SECRETIVE COMPANY THAT MIGHT END PRIVACY AS WE KNOW IT. IT'S ABOUT CLEARVIEW AI, A LITTLE KNOWN COMPANY THAT CREATED AN APP FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE FACIAL RECOGNITION.
POD1000000036_S0000040	AS THE ARTICLE SAYS, WITHOUT PUBLIC SCRUTINY, MORE THAN 600 LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE STARTED USING CLEARVIEW IN THE PAST YEAR. AND WHILE BIG TECH COMPANIES ARE AT LEAST FACING SOME SCRUTINY FOR THEIR FACIAL RECOGNITION EFFORTS, THIS COMPANY SEEMS TO HAVE FLOWN UNDER THE RADAR UNTIL NOW.
POD1000000036_S0000041	WELL, SO WHAT? YOU MIGHT THINK, I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG, WHY DOES IT MATTER IF MY FACE IS RECOGNISED IN PUBLIC? PRIVACY CAMPAIGNERS WOULD ARGUE THAT WE'RE JUST NOT AWARE YET OF EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE GIVING UP.
POD1000000036_S0000042	THE NEW YORK TIMES TOOK THE FEED FROM THREE PUBLIC WEBCAMS IN NEW YORK AND PHOTOS FROM EMPLOYER WEBSITES.
POD1000000036_S0000043	AND USING THAT, THEY MATCHED 2,750 FACES. AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE, THEY FOUND A PROFESSOR ON HIS WAY TO LUNCH WITH A JOB CANDIDATE.
POD1000000036_S0000044	AS THE TIMES SAYS, OUR EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT A PERSON EQUIPPED WITH JUST A FEW CAMERAS AND FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY CAN LEARN PEOPLE'S DAILY HABITS, WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE OFFICE EACH DAY, WHO THEY GET COFFEE WITH, WHETHER THEY LEFT WORK EARLY.
POD1000000036_S0000045	THE PROFESSOR'S REACTION WHEN HE WAS TOLD WAS, OH MY GOD, THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. BUT THESE DAYS, IT REALLY IS EASIER AND EASIER TO BELIEVE.
POD1000000036_S0000046	I'M JACK STEWART, AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH.
POD1000000036_S0000048	THIS IS APM.
POD1000000037_S0000001	SUMMER CAMP, FRESH AIR, BONFIRES, OR, YOU KNOW, STAYING INSIDE AND LEARNING HOW TO SHOOT YOUTUBE VIDEOS.
POD1000000037_S0000003	FOR AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA, THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH, DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY.
POD1000000037_S0000004	I'M JED KIM, IN FOR MOLLYWOOD.
POD1000000037_S0000006	SUMMER VACATION IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING. FOR SOME FAMILIES THAT MEANS SENDING KIDS TO CAMP. SOME OF THOSE ARE YOUTUBE CAMPS.
POD1000000037_S0000007	ESSENTIALLY, PLACES WHERE KIDS CAN LEARN HOW TO CREATE SLICKER YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND CHANNELS.
POD1000000037_S0000008	THE DEMAND HAS GROWN AS KIDS WANT TO EMULATE THE ONLINE STARS THEY WATCH.
POD1000000037_S0000009	JULIE JARGON IS THE FAMILY AND TECH COLUMNIST AT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND SHE WROTE ABOUT THE TREND.
POD1000000037_S0000010	SHE SAID KIDS LEARN HOW TO LIGHT, SHOOT, AND EDIT VIDEOS. ALSO, HOW TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONAL BRANDS.
POD1000000037_S0000011	THEY'RE TEACHING THEM TO CREATE THEIR OWN UNIQUE VOICE SO THAT THEY CAN STAND OUT IN THE CROWD OF YOUTUBERS AND DEVELOP ORIGINAL CONTENT.
POD1000000037_S0000012	BUT YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE KIDS I TALK TO, THEY JUST WANT TO SHOOT VIDEOS OF THEMSELVES PLAYING FORTNITE.
POD1000000037_S0000013	SO THERE'S A LOT OF THAT ALREADY. BUT THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF KIDS ARE INTERESTED IN DOING. THEY WATCH THE YOUTUBERS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND THEN THEY WANT TO DO IT THEMSELVES.
POD1000000037_S0000014	YEAH, I GOTTA SAY, I HEAR YOUTUBE CAMP AND MY INITIAL REACTION IS GROSS.
POD1000000037_S0000016	BUT I KNOW THAT'S JUST LIKE ME BEING UNINFORMED AND REACTIONARY. HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THIS.
POD1000000037_S0000017	WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S THE REACTION ACTUALLY OF A LOT OF PARENTS AND I THERE IS A DEBATE RAGING IN A LOT OF HOUSEHOLDS RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHETHER TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO HAVE THEIR OWN YOUTUBE CHANNELS
POD1000000037_S0000018	AND A LOT OF THE FIRST TIME REACTION FROM PARENTS IS NO.
POD1000000037_S0000019	YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT KIDS BEING EXPOSED PUBLICLY AND BEING OPEN TO BULLYING AND PREDATORS AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT WE WORRY ABOUT ON THE INTERNET.
POD1000000037_S0000020	BUT A LOT OF THE PARENTS I SPOKE TO WHO ALSO SHARED THOSE CONCERNS, YOU KNOW, KIND OF WENT ABOUT IT THOUGHTFULLY AND SAID, WELL, MY KID WANTS TO DO SOMETHING. THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. HOW DO I FOSTER THAT?
POD1000000037_S0000021	AND IS THERE A WAY TO LOOK AT YOUTUBE AS A MEDIUM THAT CAN BE AN OUTLET FOR THEIR CREATIVITY TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ON THEIR OWN AT HOME?
POD1000000037_S0000022	AND ALSO HOW CAN THOSE SKILLS TRANSLATE TO OTHER LIFE EXPERIENCES.
POD1000000037_S0000023	AND ALSO JUST LEARNING THE POISE AND THE COMPOSURE OF SPEAKING ON FILM AND ADDRESSING AN AUDIENCE.
POD1000000037_S0000024	YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE ALL GOOD THINGS FOR KIDS TO KNOW HOW TO DO.
POD1000000037_S0000025	YEAH, SUMMER IS THIS, I GUESS IT'S LIKE A BLANK CANVAS FOR KIDS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. OR I GUESS WHAT THEIR PARENTS WANT THEM TO LEARN.
POD1000000037_S0000026	AND ARE PARENTS MORE VALUING DEVELOPING DIGITAL SKILLS THAN THEY WERE IN THE PAST?
POD1000000037_S0000027	I THINK SO. I THINK THERE'S A GROWING AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT THESE KIND OF SKILLS COULD BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE CAREERS. I MEAN, GAMING ALONE IS SUCH A HUGE INDUSTRY.
POD1000000037_S0000028	A LOT OF KIDS GO TO CODING CAMPS TO LEARN HOW TO CODE VIDEO GAMES.
POD1000000037_S0000029	SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIGITAL SORT OF SKILLS THAT, YOU KNOW, OLDER GENERATION OF PARENTS DON'T HAVE AND THEY'RE SEEING THAT IT COULD BE APPLICABLE TO FUTURE CAREER CHOICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
POD1000000037_S0000030	SOME PARENTS ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT SCREEN TIME AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND SPENDING ALL DAY VIDEO GAMING. EVEN IF IT IS FOR LEARNING.
POD1000000037_S0000031	SO WHAT MAKES A FAMILY MORE WARY OF TECH COMPARED TO OTHER FAMILIES THAT ARE LIKE, GO FOR IT.
POD1000000037_S0000032	I JUST THINK IT COMES DOWN TO AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND INDIVIDUAL FEELINGS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. SOME FAMILIES JUST REALLY EMBRACE IT AND THEY DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE BEHIND.
POD1000000037_S0000033	AND THEY FEEL LIKE IF THEIR KIDS AREN'T LEARNING THESE SKILLS OR AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET MORE BROADLY, THAT THEY WILL SOMEHOW BE SOCIAL OUTCASTS OR THEY WON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN, YOU KNOW, IN THE FUTURE WORKFORCE.
POD1000000037_S0000034	OTHER PARENTS ARE JUST REALLY CAUTIOUS. I MEAN, IT'S NOT WHAT WE GREW UP WITH.
POD1000000037_S0000035	AND SO YOU HEAR THE HORROR STORIES AND YOU HEAR ABOUT ONLINE BULLYING AND YOUTUBE IS A VERY PUBLIC FORUM AND PEOPLE CAN LEAVE MEAN COMMENTS.
POD1000000037_S0000036	AND IS A CHILD REALLY READY TO DEAL WITH THAT? ARE THEY DEVELOPMENTALLY READY AND EMOTIONALLY READY TO LET IT ROLL OFF THEIR SKIN WHEN SOMEONE POSTS A MEAN COMMENT ABOUT THEIR VIDEO?
POD1000000037_S0000037	THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING FOR ADULTS TO EVEN FACE, THAT KIND OF CRITICISM FROM THE TROLLS. AND SO PARENTS HAVE TO REALLY PREPARE THEIR KIDS FOR THAT.
POD1000000037_S0000038	I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO. YOU CAN MODERATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE POSTED ON YOUTUBE. YOU CAN TURN THEM OFF. YOU CAN MAKE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL PRIVATE SO NO ONE CAN SEE IT.
POD1000000037_S0000039	THAT SORT OF DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF POSTING ON YOUTUBE THOUGH, BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO BE SHARED AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS ARE MEANT TO BE COMMENTED ON.
POD1000000037_S0000040	IT'S JUST A WHOLE NEW WORLD THAT PARENTS ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE AND IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO PERSONAL CHOICE AS TO WHETHER YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO JUMP INTO THAT WORLD OR MAYBE KIND OF KEEP THEM AWAY FROM IT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE.
POD1000000037_S0000041	LET'S TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT KIND OF THE FAME SIDE OF THINGS. SOME CAMPS THAT YOU FOUND WERE CAUTIONING AGAINST BUILDING EXPECTATIONS THAT YOUR KID'S GOING TO BE A STAR.
POD1000000037_S0000042	BUT OTHER CAMPS WERE LIKE USING IT AS A MARKETING POINT.
POD1000000037_S0000043	ANYTHING PROBLEMATIC WITH THAT?
POD1000000037_S0000044	YEAH, I MEAN, WHAT IS THE REALITY OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT YOUR CHILD IS GOING TO ACHIEVE SOME SORT OF YOUTUBE FAME?
POD1000000037_S0000045	PROBABLY PRETTY SLIM CONSIDERING HOW MANY VIDEOS ARE ON YOUTUBE AND SORT OF THE MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT THE ALGORITHM CHOOSES TO PUSH UP. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU CAN CREATE A VIDEO AND GET NO VIEWS.
POD1000000037_S0000046	IT'S REALLY HARD SOMETIMES TO SIFT THROUGH ALL THE VIDEOS AND FIND A VIDEO ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC. YOU KNOW, AND THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE A BILLION HOURS OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS VIEWED DAILY.
POD1000000037_S0000047	SO HOW DO YOU BREAK THROUGH THE CLUTTER AND MAKE YOUR VIDEO STAND OUT?
POD1000000037_S0000048	I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I THINK PARENTS HAVE TO BE REALISTIC WITH THEMSELVES AND WITH THEIR CHILDREN THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU POST A VIDEO TO YOUTUBE DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO START, YOU KNOW, HAVING A MILLION SUBSCRIBERS.
POD1000000037_S0000049	RYE.
POD1000000037_S0000050	AND, YOU KNOW, ADVERTISING AND SPONSORSHIP CONTRACTS AND THAT KIND OF THING.
POD1000000037_S0000051	I MEAN, CERTAINLY PEOPLE HAVE ACHIEVED FAME AND FORTUNE ON YOUTUBE, BUT JUST LIKE WITH ANYTHING ELSE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BECOME NECESSARILY THE NEXT STAR NBA PLAYER JUST BECAUSE YOU GO TO A BASKETBALL CAMP.
POD1000000037_S0000052	SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO JUST BE REALISTIC AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU AND YOUR WHAT YOUR CHILD WANTS TO ACHIEVE WITH THEIR YOUTUBE CHANNEL.
POD1000000037_S0000053	JULIE JARGON WRITES ABOUT FAMILY AND TECH AT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. I ASKED HER IF THIS MEANS MORE KIDS WILL BE COMING HOME FROM CAMP, STARTING CONVERSATIONS BY SAYING,
POD1000000037_S0000054	HEY GUYS, MADISON HERE. I'VE GOT A COUPLE GREAT THINGS TO SHARE WITH YOU." JULIE SAID, YEAH, THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING, EVEN OUTSIDE OF CAMP.
POD1000000037_S0000056	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS! INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW YOUTUBE IS WORKING TO WEED OUT THE OBJECTIONABLE VIDEOS THAT GET UPLOADED?
POD1000000037_S0000057	VOX SAT DOWN WITH NEIL MOHAN, THE COMPANY'S CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER. HE SAYS IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST FINDING BAD VIDEOS AND REMOVING THEM. IT'S ABOUT CONSTANTLY UPDATING THE USER GUIDELINES FOR COMPUTER AND HUMAN WORKERS TO FOLLOW.

POD1000000039_S0000015	I WAS, I WOULDN'T SLEEP ENOUGH BECAUSE I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I DIDN'T GET TO PLAY. I WAS SO ANGRY AT THAT TIME. I'D RATHER HAVE NOT PLAYED THOSE 13 MINUTES THAN TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COURTESY 12 MINUTES IN A GAME.
POD1000000039_S0000017	DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW INSANE IT IS TO GIVE JUST 13 MINUTES OF PLAY?
POD1000000039_S0000018	NOT EVEN REAL PLAY, BUT TOKEN GESTURE, PATRONIZING, THROWAWAY PLAY.
POD1000000039_S0000021	IT'S MADNESS, AND IT VERY NEARLY BROKE THE MAN.
POD1000000039_S0000023	I LIKE CLOSURE. I LIKE CLOSURE. I LIKE KNOWING WHY I FUCKED UP. I LIKE KNOWING WHAT I DID WRONG SO I CAN FIX IT. AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT I DID WRONG IN 98.

POD1000000039_S0000029	NOT LONG AFTER HE'D RETURNED HOME FROM FRANCE.
POD1000000039_S0000031	I GOT A LETTER.
POD1000000039_S0000033	IT WAS FROM STEVE SAMPSON.
POD1000000039_S0000035	A LETTER THAT I DID NOT OPEN FOR ALMOST TWO AND A HALF YEARS. IT JUST SAT IN MY DRAWER. I DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN IT. I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
POD1000000039_S0000036	WELL, DID THE LETTER SAY MORE TO IT?
POD1000000039_S0000037	I JUST REMEMBER THE QUOTE THAT SAID, WELL HINDSIGHT'S 20 20, AND I JUST KIND OF SAT THERE GOING, OKAY, SO THIS IS THE WAY YOU APOLOGIZE?

POD1000000039_S0000039	I NEVER GOT CLOSURE. I NEVER GOT TOLD WHAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH ABOUT MY GAME. HE INSERTED MADNESS TO EVERYBODY'S LIFE. NOT JUST ME. I THINK HE DID IT TO LEXI. AND I THINK HE DID THAT TO A LOT OF GUYS. I THINK THAT AT THAT TIME, LIKE I SAID, NOW, NOT A BIG DEAL.
POD1000000039_S0000040	BUT AT THE TIME, YOU KNOW, I GO BACK AND I JUST SAY, HE SCREWED MENTALLY WITH ME LIKE NO OTHER COACH HAS EVER DONE TO ME.
POD1000000039_S0000041	DID YOU EVER WRITE A LETTER BACK TO STEVE SIMPSON?

POD1000000039_S0000050	I ONLY WROTE A LETTER TO MARCELLA BALBOA. I DIDN'T WRITE TO ANYBODY ELSE.
POD1000000039_S0000051	HE SAID THERE WAS A PHRASE IN A SET WITH TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THIS WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.
POD1000000039_S0000052	IN 2020 HINDSIGHT, I SHOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY TO GET HIM ON THAT FIELD BECAUSE I THINK HIS EXPERIENCE AND HIS VETERANSHIP WOULD HAVE AFFECTED THE TEAM IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY. TO THIS DAY, I FEEL BADLY THAT MARCELO BALBOA DIDN'T PLAY MORE THAN WHAT HE DID.

POD1000000039_S0000128	OH
POD1000000039_S0000130	IT WASN'T JUST FRANKIE'S INNATE ABILITY TO MAKE LEMONADE OUT OF LEMONS THAT GOT HIM THROUGH.
POD1000000039_S0000132	IT WAS A JOB OFFER. HE GOT THE NIGHT OFF TO THE YUGOSLAVIA GAME.
POD1000000039_S0000133	RIGHT AFTER DINNER, I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM MY AGENT WHO WAS AT THE HOTEL AND BAYER LEVERKUSEN.
POD1000000039_S0000134	JUST EXPLAIN WHO THEY ARE.
POD1000000039_S0000135	BUY OUR LEVERKUSEN. I WOULD SAY IT WAS...
POD1000000039_S0000137	TOP FIVE GERMAN TEAMS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL TIME, BUT OVER THE LAST 25 30 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY MUCH IN THE TOP FIVE, TOP EIGHT IN THE BUNDESLIGA.
POD1000000039_S0000138	I ENDED UP SIGNING THE CONTRACT THAT NIGHT PRETTY MUCH I THINK. I WAS MAKING 30 GRAND IN THE MLS A YEAR AND I WAS BEING OFFERED 1.4 MILLION.
POD1000000039_S0000139	SO IT WAS A NO BRAINER.
POD1000000039_S0000140	SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THIS, EVERYONE IS GOING MAD. PLAYERS ARE POPPING OFF, PLAYERS ARE SELF DESTRUCTING, PLAYERS ARE BURNING DOWN. YOU'RE LIKE, I'M DOING GREAT, GUY.
POD1000000039_S0000142	YOU WERE LIKE AT A WEDDING EVERYBODY ELSE WAS AT A FUNERAL
POD1000000039_S0000144	YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, YEAH, TOTALLY. 100%. YEAH, IT'S CRAZY HOW THAT WORKS OUT, RIGHT? IT WAS SUCH A BAD THING FOR SO MANY PEOPLE, AND FOR ME IT WAS...
POD1000000039_S0000146	IT ENDED UP CHANGING MY LIFE IN PROBABLY THE BEST WAY EVER. I WOULDN'T BE FISHING. I WOULDN'T BE HITTING GOLF BALLS OFF MY BACK DECK.
POD1000000039_S0000148	YEAH, NO, REALLY. THAT'S CRAZY. YEAH. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YEAH. AND I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY.

POD1000000039_S0000156	PRESS OFFICER JIM.
POD1000000039_S0000158	A SLIGHTLY SOURER MEMORY THAT HE'S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SHRUG OFF.
POD1000000039_S0000160	THE DUMPSTERS, THE GARBAGE CANS WERE OVERFLOWING WITH SUITS THAT WERE JUST LIKE.
POD1000000039_S0000161	COMPLETE DISRESPECT FOR WHAT THEY WERE GIVEN. THESE WERE FANCY CLOTHES GIVEN TO THE PLAYERS BY A PROUD US SOCCER FEDERATION BACK IN MORE OPTIMISTIC DAYS.
POD1000000039_S0000162	NAVY BLUE BLAZERS, ALL TAILORED WITH THE US NATIONAL TEAM CRESTS SEWN ON THE BREAST POCKET. THEY WERE MEANT TO BE WORN PROUDLY ON GAME DAY BEFORE THE PLAYERS CHANGED TO GO ON THE FIELD. BUT INSTEAD, THE TEAM TRASHED THEM.
POD1000000039_S0000164	AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE, TO ME, LIKE THE AMERICAN FLAG, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS SHOWING YOU WERE A US NATIONAL TEAM PLAYER.
POD1000000039_S0000166	AND YOU DECIDE TO THROW IT AWAY? I JUST, IT WAS, THE MOOD WAS SO BAD.
POD1000000039_S0000168	JIM FROST HAD STAYED IN THE GAME OF FOOTBALL. HE'S JUST DECIDED TO AVOID ALL FOOTBALL PLAYERS. THESE DAYS, HE WORKS IN THE WORLD.
POD1000000039_S0000171	ALEXI LALAS, HE NEVER REPRESENTED THE UNITED STATES AGAIN. HE PLAYED OUT HIS CAREER IN MLS, AND THEN TRIED HIS HAND AT BEING A GENERAL MANAGER, FINISHING WITH THE LA GALAXY.
POD1000000039_S0000172	STILL, LALLIS REMAINS A FAMILIAR FACE OF US SOCCER TO THIS DAY. HE'S FOX SPORTS' LEAD BROADCASTER FOR THE WORLD CUP IN RUSSIA.
POD1000000039_S0000174	LALLUS HAS ALSO FOUND TIME TO KEEP RECORDING THE HITS. THIS NEW ALBUM SUNSHINE JUST CAME OUT.
POD1000000039_S0000176	JOHN HAWKS, THE CAPTAIN FOR NOT QUITE LIFE, RETIRED FROM MLS IN 2003.
POD1000000039_S0000178	AND BECAME AN ANALYST FOR TELEVISION AND RADIO.
POD1000000039_S0000180	THIS YEAR, ERIC WINALDA, HE MOUNTED AN OUTSIDER CAMPAIGN TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF US SOCCER, AND HE ATTRACTED A LOT OF ATTENTION, BUT ULTIMATELY.
POD1000000039_S0000182	NOT A LOT OF OUT.
POD1000000039_S0000184	DAVID RÉGY BECAME THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL TEAM IN HIS NATIVE MARTINIQUE.
POD1000000039_S0000186	STILL DREAMS OF COACHING IN AMERICA ONE DAY.
POD1000000039_S0000188	YOU DO KNOW THAT THE US MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM NEEDS A HEAD COACH, DAVID.
POD1000000039_S0000190	YEAH, I HEARD THAT AND IT'S A DREAM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH BEFORE LEAVING THIS EARTH.
POD1000000039_S0000191	YOU AND A GOOSE AGAIN.
POD1000000039_S0000193	OH YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
POD1000000039_S0000195	YOU MIGHT RECALL, STEVE SAMPSON STARTED
POD1000000039_S0000197	IN THE 1998 WORLD CUP.
POD1000000039_S0000200	SPENT HIS ENTIRE TIME IN FRANCE ON THE BENCH.
POD1000000039_S0000202	BUT HE GOT HIS REVENGE IN 2002.
POD1000000039_S0000204	BEAT OUT FOR THE STARTING LINEUP.
POD1000000039_S0000206	MAYBE KARMA DOES EXIST AFTER ALL.
POD1000000039_S0000208	HE PLAYED FOR 10 SEASONS IN MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER AND THEN TRANSITIONED INTO A FRONT OFFICE ROLE.
POD1000000039_S0000210	SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE LEAGUE.
POD1000000039_S0000211	OF IMPROVING THE GAME IN THE UNITED STATES.
POD1000000039_S0000212	WE ARE IN THE INNER SANCTUM. WE'RE IN THE JEFF AGOOSE OFFICE.
POD1000000039_S0000213	THIS IS WHERE ALL OF THE COACHES AND GMS WILL CALL ME ON A MONDAY DESCRIBING THE PAIN THEY'VE UNDERGONE WITH EITHER POOR OFFICIATING OR POOR DISCIPLINE.
POD1000000039_S0000214	OR BOTH.
POD1000000039_S0000215	OR BOTH, YES.
POD1000000039_S0000216	AND I'M LOOKING AT AN INCREDIBLY CLEAN DESK, CLEAN DESK, CLEAN MIND.
POD1000000039_S0000217	NEXT TO A PICTURE OF HIS CHILDREN, THERE'S A FRAMED PHOTO OF THAT NOTORIOUS RED CARD HE GOT PLAYING AGAINST MEXICO IN 1997.
POD1000000039_S0000218	I HAVE IT UP TO REMIND ME THAT YOU CAN CONTROL THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF, BUT YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO. AND THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS CONTROL WHAT YOU CAN.
POD1000000039_S0000220	I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A RED CARD, BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER. IT WAS A RED CARD. AND I HURT MY TEAM AND THERE WERE RAMIFICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE RED CARD, PROFESSIONALLY AND PERSONALLY.
POD1000000039_S0000222	WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO STEVE SIMPSON.
POD1000000039_S0000224	HIS CAREER IN REVERSE, FRONT LOADING THE BIG DREAM JOB BEFORE DRIFTING BACK TOWARDS THE ROOTS OF THE GAME.
POD1000000039_S0000226	AFTER FRANCE, SAMSON WENT ON TO COACH THE COSTA RICAN NATIONAL TEAM AND HAD SPENT SOME TIME AT THE CLUB LEVEL COACHING THE LOS ANGELES GALAXY.
POD1000000039_S0000228	TODAY, STEVE IS HEAD COACH AT THE CALIFORNIA POLYTECHNIC STATE UNIVERSITY.
POD1000000039_S0000230	SO THIS IS THE JERSEY THAT WAS WORN IN THE FIFA WORLD CUP IN FRANCE 1998. THIS WAS PRESENTED TO ME PRIOR TO THE TOURNAMENT BEGINNING.
POD1000000039_S0000231	WE'RE IN STEVE SAMSON'S MODEST OFFICE.
POD1000000039_S0000232	TO BE HONEST.
POD1000000039_S0000233	AND HE'S SHOWING US THE JERSEYS THAT HANG ON HIS WALL. ONE IN PARTICULAR HAS A PLACE OF HONOUR.
POD1000000039_S0000234	BUT RED SHORT SLEEVED JERSEY SIGNED BY ALL THE PLAYERS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE WORLD CUP IN FRANCE. AGAIN, VERY PROUD TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO COACH THESE MEN.
POD1000000039_S0000235	DOES IT NOT CONJURE EVEN A HINT, A HINT OF A DARK MEMORY OF CHALLENGED TIMES WHEN YOUR EYES LOOK AT IT?
POD1000000039_S0000237	OH, CERTAINLY. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S, IT'S LIKE I'VE TOLD PEOPLE I'VE EXPERIENCED THE HIGHS OF HIGHS AND THE LOWS OF LOWS AND, AND IT'S ALL PART OF THE JOURNEY.
POD1000000039_S0000238	THAT JERSEY REPRESENTS TO ME THE ENTIRE LEAD UP, THE QUALIFICATION PHASE, ALL THE GREAT MOMENTS THAT WE HAD OVER THE YEARS LEADING UP TO THE WORLD CUP. AND YES, OF COURSE, IT CONJURES UP
POD1000000039_S0000239	SOME DISAPPOINTMENT OF NOT ACHIEVING WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO, BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THE END, AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRIDE.
POD1000000039_S0000240	EVEN IN THE DARKNESS, STEVE.
POD1000000039_S0000241	AND I'M GOING TO BE HONEST, STEVE, YOU HAVE ENDURED MORE THAN MOST, MORE THAN MOST MANAGERS THAT I HAVE ENGAGED WITH, DESPITE THE DARKNESS. IS THAT 1998 WORLD CUP, IS IT STILL A LIFE HIGH POINT?
POD1000000039_S0000243	THE 1998 WORLD CUP WASN'T JUST ABOUT THOSE THREE WEEKS IN FRANCE.
POD1000000039_S0000244	IT WAS ABOUT PROBABLY A PERIOD OF TIME THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC, IMPORTANT MOMENTS IN U.S. SOCCER HISTORY.
POD1000000039_S0000245	AND TO HAVE BEEN A PART OF THAT WAS A GREAT HONOR AND A GREAT PRIVILEGE.
POD1000000039_S0000247	I DON'T
POD1000000039_S0000249	DON'T DISMISS MY RESPONSIBILITIES AT ALL OR MY SHARE IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES
POD1000000039_S0000251	BUT I THINK THAT ALL OF US, YOU KNOW...
POD1000000039_S0000253	EVERYBODY SHOULD SHARE IN THE RESPONSIBILITY.
POD1000000039_S0000255	I THINK THERE WERE FACTORS THAT UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T GIVE US OUR VERY BEST CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT'S WHAT HAS MADE ME ANGRY OVER THE YEARS. THAT'S WHAT HAS MADE ME DISAPPOINTED OVER THE YEARS.
POD1000000039_S0000258	DO THEY HAUNT YOU IN YOUR DREAMS?
POD1000000039_S0000260	DO THEY HAUNT ME IN MY DREAMS? YEAH, TO BE HONEST, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, YES.
POD1000000039_S0000262	YEAH, I...
POD1000000039_S0000264	I FIND MYSELF THINKING ABOUT THOSE MOMENTS AND THOSE DAYS ON MANY OCCASIONS. IT'S LESS FREQUENT NOW THAN IT WAS 10 YEARS

POD1000000039_S0000279	FOR ALMOST EVERYONE I SPOKE WITH, IT'S THE GAME OF SOCCER IN THE US. THE FIGHT FOR RESPECT, FOR LEGITIMACY AND BELONGING, BOTH WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND EXTERNALLY IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD.
POD1000000039_S0000281	MORE THAN ANYTHING, 1998 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE YEAR THAT THIS GROUP OF GUYS, PLAYING THIS GAME, FINALLY WON OVER THE GREAT UNCARING AMERICAN AUDIENCE TO ESTABLISH THE GAME THEY LOVED,
POD1000000039_S0000282	SOCCER LONG DERIDED IN THE UNITED STATES AS A TRULY MAJOR LEAGUE SPORT.
POD1000000039_S0000284	AND THEY BLEW IT.
POD1000000039_S0000286	WE COULD BE MERCENARY ABOUT THIS AND SAY, WELL, THEY LOST, YOU KNOW, THE COMMERCIALS. THEY LOST THE WHEATIES BOXES. THEY DID. THEY CERTAINLY LOST ALL THAT. BUT THEY ALSO LOST THEIR PRIDE.
POD1000000039_S0000287	ESPN REPORTER
POD1000000039_S0000289	I MEAN THEY WERE A PROUD BUNCH OF GUYS THESE GUYS YOU KNOW IT'S A BIG COUNTRY THEY WERE THE BEST WE HAD TO OFFER PRETTY MUCH.
POD1000000039_S0000290	AND THEY WERE TERRIBLE AND THEY DIDN'T JUST LOSE THEY LOST TO IRAN AND THEY FINISHED LAST IN THE TOURNAMENT 32ND OUT OF 32ND
POD1000000039_S0000291	THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICANS DO. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO. WE DON'T LOSE LIKE THAT.
POD1000000039_S0000292	AND THE RAMIFICATIONS FOR SOCCER.
POD1000000039_S0000293	AS WE FOUND OUT YOU DON'T EVEN GET THESE CHANCES EVERY FOUR YEARS AND WHEN YOU GET THEM YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE ESPECIALLY IN A CULTURE IN WHICH THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION.
POD1000000039_S0000294	THE REST OF THE TIME THE WAY THEY ARE DURING THAT MONTH AND BY GOING OUT IN IGNOMINIOUS FASHION HUMILIATING FASHION.
POD1000000039_S0000296	I THINK THIS IS IN SOME WAYS USUALLY TOO STRONG A WORD TO APPLY TO SPORTS.
POD1000000039_S0000298	THIS WAS DISGRACEFUL FASHION. THEY HURT SOCCER.
POD1000000039_S0000300	SO THE DAMAGE TO THE PROFILE OF THE GAME, YOU HAD PEOPLE WATCHING.
POD1000000039_S0000302	SO I PUT THAT DAMAGE IN EXCESS OF A BILLION DOLLARS.
POD1000000039_S0000303	IT'S HANK STEINBRECHER AGAIN.
POD1000000039_S0000305	HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET OVER 1998?
POD1000000039_S0000307	OH, I'M NOT OVER IT.
POD1000000039_S0000309	I'M NOT OVER IT. THAT WAS THE LOWEST POINT OF MY CAREER.
POD1000000039_S0000311	I'M NOT OVER IT.
POD1000000039_S0000313	YOU LIVE WITH IT.
POD1000000039_S0000315	WHAT MISTAKES DID I MAKE THAT AFFECTED THAT GAME?
POD1000000039_S0000317	SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT CARE AS MUCH AS I DID.
POD1000000039_S0000319	BUT I CARE. AND WE FAILED. AND I DON'T LIKE THE FAILURE, EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THE
POD1000000039_S0000322	AND NOBODY EVER SAYS THIS OUT LOUD, BUT I'M GONNA. NOT UNTIL BRANDI CHASTAIN SAVED IT IN 1999 DID WE HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THE SPORT. BUT THE BOYS HAD BLOWN IT.
POD1000000039_S0000323	WE HAD REALLY LOST A LOT OF RESPECT FROM THE WORLD AND INTERNALLY.
POD1000000039_S0000325	IN 1999, THE US WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM, THEY EXPLODED INTO AMERICA'S CONSCIOUSNESS. ONE YEAR AFTER AMERICA'S MOST DISMAL FAILURE, SOCCER ONCE AGAIN WAS BREAKFAST TABLE CONVERSATION ACROSS AMERICA.
POD1000000039_S0000326	BECAUSE PLAYERS LIKE BRANDI CHASTAIN AND MIA HAMM, THEY WERE PLASTERED ALL OVER OUR WHEATIES BOXES.
POD1000000039_S0000328	SO YEAH, WHILE IT'S DARK THAT THE US MEN FAILED TO EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE 2018 WORLD CUP, WORRY NOT. THE US WOMEN WILL, PLEASE GOD, ONCE AGAIN REDEEM THEMSELVES.
POD1000000039_S0000330	AT THE 2019 WORLD CUP. BUT ULTIMATELY, IT DOESN'T MATTER. BECAUSE AMERICA, YOU'VE GOT TO FACE IT.
POD1000000039_S0000331	SOCCER'S HERE. IT'S IN YOUR HEART. THE HONEST TRUTH IS, I CAN WATCH MORE SOCCER IN THE US THAN I EVER COULD WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED.
POD1000000039_S0000332	REMEMBER, BACK THEN, I COULD ONLY HEAR A BIG GAME IN ENGLAND BY HAVING MY DAD TO HOLD UP THE PHONE TO HIS OWN TELEVISION BACK IN LIVERPOOL.
POD1000000039_S0000333	NOW I CAN WATCH THE ACTION FROM DOZENS OF LEAGUES FROM MAJOR TO OBSCURE AND SCREAM AT THEM AT MY OWN TELEVISION IN MY OWN HOME IN NEW YORK CITY.
POD1000000039_S0000335	AND I'M NOT ALONE. 72,000 PEOPLE PACKED A STADIUM IN ATLANTA THIS SEASON TO SET AN MLS SINGLE GAME ATTENDANCE RECORD.
POD1000000039_S0000336	AND YOU KNOW WHO SET THE TWO PREVIOUS ATTENDANCE RECORDS? ATLANTA. YES, ATLANTA, PEOPLE.
POD1000000039_S0000338	THE VIDEO GAME EA SPORTS FIFA HAS BECOME MORE THAN JUST A BEST SELLING VIDEO GAME. IT'S A TOOL THAT'S INTRODUCED A GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO THE TEAMS AND THE STARS THAT PLAY THE GAME.
POD1000000039_S0000340	PROOF? CRISTIANO RONALDO AND LIONEL MESSI NOW REGULARLY POLL IN THE TOP 10 WHEN AMERICANS ARE ASKED TO NAME THEIR FAVORITE SPORTS STARS, OUTSTRIPPING MOST OF THEIR NFL, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL AND NBA COUNTERPARTS.
POD1000000039_S0000341	SOCCER IS NOW EVERYWHERE IN AMERICA. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, YOUR COUNTRY IS A SOCCER COUNTRY. BUT FOR YOUR MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM, THERE'S STILL ONE THING MISSING.
POD1000000039_S0000343	GO FOR IT. WE'RE AMERICANS. I CAN. LET'S CLIMB EVEREST. LET'S GO TO THE MOON. LET'S CURE CANCER.
POD1000000039_S0000345	GO FOR IT. LET'S WIN A WORLD CUP. LET'S WIN A WORLD CUP.

POD1000000040_S0000399	OUR KIDS LEARN AND GROW BY BEING INTERACTIVE AND PLAYING ON THE PLAYGROUND AND WRESTLING AND JUST BEING A KID.
POD1000000040_S0000400	AND THERE WAS THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR LIKE ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS IN A POD WHERE FIVE FAMILIES GOT TOGETHER AND WE HIRED THIS TEACHER AND ONE OF OUR FRIENDS HAD SOME SPACE IN THEIR HOUSE SO THEY CREATED LIKE YOU KNOW CLASSROOM.
POD1000000040_S0000401	FIVE KIDS TAKING THE CURRICULUM AND JUST TEACHING IT. AND THEY'VE HAD, IT'S BEEN THE BEST THING EVER FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE JUST TO SEE THERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO WEAR MASKS AND THEY HAVE TO DO THIS.

POD1000000040_S0000403	BUT EVERYBODY HAS TO WEAR A MASK ALL THE TIME. THEY'RE GOING TO BE SIX FEET APART AT ALL TIMES. IF YOUR CHILD FALLS, UNFORTUNATELY, OUR TEACHERS CAN'T GO AND PICK THEM UP OR REMOVE THEIR MASK. I'M LIKE, WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

POD1000000042_S0000091	AND MAYBE THIS SHOW WILL BE THE PLATFORM FOR YOU. FOR YOU AS A PERSON, WHY WAS THIS SO IMPORTANT TO WRITE?
POD1000000042_S0000093	YOU KNOW, FUNDAMENTALLY, THE STRONGEST FORCE IN THIS NATION IS OUR ECONOMY. AND PEOPLE DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. YOU KNOW, IT IS OUR DUTY AS AMERICAN CITIZENS TO MAKE SURE THAT THING IS AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE WHEN IT IS, WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED IN THE MILITARY.
POD1000000042_S0000094	AND FOR A VET COMING OUT, IF YOU CAN'T FIND PURPOSE, YOU KNOW, SO MANY VETS NOWADAYS SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW MY WHY, I DON'T KNOW MY PURPOSE. YEAH, YOU'VE GOT ONE PURPOSE. GET A JOB, MAKE THE ECONOMY STRONGER.
POD1000000042_S0000095	AND THAT'S YOUR DUTY TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF MILITARY LEADERS COMING IN.
POD1000000042_S0000097	AND WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S SO HARD TO GET THROUGH PEOPLE'S HEADS OF WHY THEY SHOULD HIRE MILITARY VETERANS? THIS IS ONE THAT I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND.
POD1000000042_S0000098	IN A MILLION YEARS.
POD1000000042_S0000100	YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S RESUME IS FAR LESS IMPORTANT THAN THEIR ABILITY TO FUCKING CHANGE ON THE FLY, RIGHT? TO ABSORB INFORMATION, MAKE QUICK DECISIONS, AND THEN TURN THAT INFORMATION INTO GOOD DECISIONS.
POD1000000042_S0000101	YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU CAN TEACH PEOPLE TO DO IT. IT'S NOT TRUE THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH PEOPLE, BUT PEOPLE THAT CAN DO IT UNDER EXTREME DURESS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU WANT IN THOSE HIGH LEVEL POSITIONS.
POD1000000042_S0000102	YES, OR IN EVEN LOWER LEVEL POSITIONS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL. I GOT MY FIRST TASTE OF IT ON RANGE 15. WHEN I DIRECTED THAT, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WHERE MOST OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE CAMERA WERE VETERANS.
POD1000000042_S0000103	THEY DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE AS TYPICAL PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD, BUT THE WORK ETHIC, THEY OUTWORKED ANY OF THOSE LAZY ASSHOLES LIKE THREE TO ONE. AND AFTER THAT, I MEAN, MY MIND COMPLETELY CHANGED WHERE I WAS JUST LIKE, DUDE,
POD1000000042_S0000104	IF YOU'RE NOT HIRING MILITARY VETERANS TO DO ALL THE SHIT, YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON… BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH THEM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH THEM WORTH ETHIC WHATSOEVER OR WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET UP EARLY AND WORK HARD AND ALL THAT STUFF.
POD1000000042_S0000105	THAT'S ALREADY INSTILLED IN EVERYBODY THAT COMES OUT OF THE MILITARY. AS A CIVILIAN, MY GOD MAN, THAT'S THE FIRST FUCKING PEOPLE I WOULD HIRE OVER ANY OF THESE FUCKING ASSHOLES. IT WAS LIKE, EH.
POD1000000042_S0000106	MY DAD DID THIS OR I GOT IN THIS OR WHATEVER AND IT'S LIKE, WELL GREAT, HOW IS THAT GONNA HELP MY COMPANY?
POD1000000042_S0000107	SO THE BOOK IS NOT EXACTLY AN ARGUMENT FOR WHY YOU SHOULD HIRE VETERANS, BUT AS A WHOLE, IT SPEAKS TO YOU HIRE FOR CHARACTER, YOU HIRE FOR ATTITUDE, YOU HIRE FOR MINDSET.
POD1000000042_S0000108	INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, WHICH IS HOW 99% OF COMPANIES HIRE, IS NOT A PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS. IT'S NOT. JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS FIVE YEARS OF MARKETING EXPERIENCE DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOOD AT MARKETING.
POD1000000042_S0000109	IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY WITH ALL THE RIGHT ATTRIBUTES AND YOU TRAIN THEM, LIKE YOU JUST SAID, THEY WILL OUTWORK, THEY WILL OUTPACE THOSE PEOPLE EVENTUALLY. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING. YOU KNOW, THE SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES WITH VETERANS, YOU KNOW WHERE CIVILIANS GET THIS.
POD1000000042_S0000110	BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST, YOU KNOW, COMING OUT OF WORLD WAR TWO, PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE SERVED IN THE MILITARY FOR THE MOST PART. YEAH. AND THEY HAD, THEY UNDERSTOOD
POD1000000042_S0000111	I HAD TO, YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000112	YEAH. THEY UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF VETERANS. IT'S NOW THE 1% VERSUS THE 99%.
POD1000000042_S0000113	WELL, I MEAN, IT'S IT'S POINT FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT, ACTUALLY, TO BE SPECIFIC. YES. I THINK IN I THINK IN WORLD WAR TWO WAS LIKE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO THE NOW POINT FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT. YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000115	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000116	SO IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD NOW, OBVIOUSLY.
POD1000000042_S0000117	SO THE 99.5% THEIR PERCEPTIONS ARE BASED OFF WHAT THEY SEE IN THE MOVIES. HOLLYWOOD IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE BEST RECRUITING TOOL FOR THE MILITARY. IT'S ALSO ITS WORST ENEMY WHEN YOU GET OUT.
POD1000000042_S0000118	THAT'S WHY SHOWS LIKE SEAL TEAM ARE SO IMPORTANT. LIKE THEY GET IT ALL RIGHT, THEY DON'T CHURCH UP ANY OF THE BULLSHIT. AND IT'S ONE THING TO BE, TO CHALLENGE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND TAKE THEM ON IN A NETWORK ENVIRONMENT IS TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE MURDERING PEOPLE BASICALLY.
POD1000000042_S0000119	BUT THEY GET A LOT RIGHT AND ALL THOSE GUYS ARE HUGE SUPPORTERS OF THE MILITARY AS WELL. THAT'S WHY THEY GOT INTO THE PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE. TYLER IS A, YOU KNOW, TYLER.
POD1000000042_S0000120	TELEGRAHE
POD1000000042_S0000121	HE'S A HE'S A FUCKING MAN. YES. HE IS. HE IS A MAGNET FOR GOOD AND TALENTED PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT HIM THAT MAKES THAT HAPPEN. MAYBE HE'S JESUS. IT'S HARD TO SAY.
POD1000000042_S0000123	IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE, FIRST OF ALL, HE'S ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING HUMAN BEINGS I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE, BUT HE'S ALSO BRILLIANT AND AN OPERATOR.
POD1000000042_S0000124	PEOPLE FLOCK TO HIM TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS SHIT LIKE THAT. AND I TALK TO PEOPLE, I'VE BEEN ON SET A COUPLE TIMES, I'VE TALKED TO THE PEOPLE THAT WORK ON THAT SHOW THAT HAVE BEEN IN HOLLYWOOD FOR YEARS, AND THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT VETS THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE DO.
POD1000000042_S0000125	THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY THEY SPEAK. AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IT'S JUST EXPERIENCE, RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000126	THAT'S ALL IT IS. IT'S EXPERIENCE ONE ON ONE WITH A HUMAN BEING. IT'S THE REASON NOBODY HATES GAY PEOPLE ANYMORE. EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID OF GAY PEOPLE 15 YEARS AGO. AND THEY'RE LIKE, OH, EVERYBODY'S GAY, COOL. NOW NO ONE CARES ANYMORE. AND I THINK THERE'S SOME RETICENCE.
POD1000000042_S0000127	ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO DEAL WITH VETERANS, JUST TO DEAL WITH THEM IN GENERAL. AND WE'RE ALSO REALLY BAD AT ASKING FOR HELP WHEN WE NEED IT TOO.
POD1000000042_S0000128	SO ALL THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER AND THE RESULT, UNFORTUNATELY, VERY OFTEN IS SOME DUDE ALONE IN HIS APARTMENT WITH A FUCKING GUN IN HIS HAND. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THAT'S A TOO COMMON STANDARD HERE. AND IT IS WHAT IT IS. I MEAN, WE HAVE TO EDUCATE.
POD1000000042_S0000129	AT THE END OF THE DAY, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BOOK DOES.
POD1000000042_S0000130	WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE SERVED IN A TRIBE, REALLY SOME OF THE LAST TRIBES THAT EXIST IN THE US. AND WHEN YOU LEAVE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ALL YOU KNEW WAS TEAM AND ESPRIT DE CORPS,
POD1000000042_S0000131	IT'S HARD TO COME BACK, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE THE LEADERSHIP IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION, WHERE WE EXPECT OUR LEADERSHIP TO BE THE BEST AND WE GET THE EXACT OPPOSITE AND THEY CAN'T EVEN WORK WITH IT, YOU KNOW, TOGETHER WITH SOME CIVILITY.
POD1000000042_S0000132	AND YOU COME BACK FROM A MILITARY ENVIRONMENT AND YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
POD1000000042_S0000133	WE'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED. WE'VE GOT THE BEST MILITARY THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE. WE HAVE THE BEST IDEA, THE BEST FUNDAMENTAL IDEA THAT ANY COUNTRY IS BASED ON.
POD1000000042_S0000134	AND I THINK IT'S TWO PARTS. ONE IS INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THE OTHER PART IS WHAT MLK SAID. YOU HAVE TWO HANDS FOR A REASON. ONE TO PULL YOURSELF UP AND ONE TO PULL THE NEXT GUY UP WITH YOU.
POD1000000042_S0000135	THOSE ARE THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF MOST AMERICANS LIVES I HOPE. BUT SOMEHOW WE END UP EVERY SINGLE YEAR WITH THE SHITTIEST POSSIBLE LEADERS. LIKE WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT AMERICAN CULTURE THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PUT PEOPLE IN
POD1000000042_S0000137	I THINK MAYBE THE PRESUMPTION THAT EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE IS A DANGEROUS PRESUMPTION. BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF FUCKING SNAKES OUT THERE. AND WE'VE PUT THAT PART OF OUR BRAIN ON HOLD BECAUSE OUR LIVES ARE BUSY.
POD1000000042_S0000138	BUT IT MIGHT BE TIME TO START PAYING A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN POLITICS AGAIN. NOT JUST FUCKING RE SHARING STUPID SHIT ON FACEBOOK, BUT ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHO'S SAYING WHAT, HOW FULL OF SHIT BOTH OF THESE PARTIES ARE.
POD1000000042_S0000139	AND HOW THEY'RE BASICALLY JUST FUCKING USING YOU TO GET WHAT THEY WANT. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO FUCKING TURN INWARD AND START LOOKING AT THEMSELVES AND HOW THEY'VE ALLOWED THIS SHIT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PREVENT IT FROM CONTINUING, WE HAVE TO STOP IT IN ITS TRACKS.
POD1000000042_S0000140	WE HAVE TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN AS WELL. LIKE WE'RE NOT LEARNING A LOT OF LESSONS RIGHT NOW. EVERYBODY'S JUST
POD1000000042_S0000142	IT'S FUCKING STUPID.
POD1000000042_S0000143	IF YOU DON'T TAKE AN INTEREST IN POLITICS, POLITICS WILL ASSUREDLY TAKE AN INTEREST IN YOU. AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW SEEING THAT AND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET OUT TO VOTE IS, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO SAY DISGUSTING.
POD1000000042_S0000144	BUT THAT IS YOUR CIVIC DUTY TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WAKE UP AND THEY'RE GOING TO START GETTING A LOT MORE INVOLVED.
POD1000000042_S0000145	QUITE FRANKLY, VETERANS.
POD1000000042_S0000146	HMM.
POD1000000042_S0000147	WE NEED MORE VETERANS LIKE DAN CRENSHAW.
POD1000000042_S0000148	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000149	IN THERE WITH, YOU KNOW, DAN HAS SHOWN THE ABILITY TO REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND HAVE A CIVIL CONVERSATION. YEAH, THAT GUY IS DEFINITELY THE CANDIDATE FOR 2024. I DON'T DOUBT THAT ONE BIT.
POD1000000042_S0000150	MAYBE YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT AS WELL
POD1000000042_S0000151	AS LONG AS HIS OWN PARTY IN THEIR FUCKING DEEP BUTTHURT STATE THAT THEY'RE IN RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS OVER YET BY THE WAY, BUT IN THEIR DEEP BUTTHURT STATE.
POD1000000042_S0000152	THEY'RE GONNA LASH OUT AT ANYBODY THAT GIVES ANYTHING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE. AND THAT IS THE FUCKING DUMBEST SHIT OF ALL TIME. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOURSELF TRULY IRRELEVANT, BECOME THE TEA PARTY. START TO SHOUT.
POD1000000042_S0000153	THOU SHALT NOT INFRINGE OVER AND OVER UNTIL YOUR EARS BLEED AND EVERYBODY'S LIKE, ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THAT IDIOT ANYMORE.
POD1000000042_S0000154	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000155	IF YOU THINK YOU CAN GO PLAY THIS GAME, WHATEVER THIS GAME IS, WITHOUT NEGOTIATING AND TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S... IT'S NOT ABOUT GIVING UP GROUND. IT'S ABOUT TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES AND CIRCUMSTANCES INTO FUCKING MIND.
POD1000000042_S0000156	WHEN YOU'RE MAKING DECISIONS. THAT'S A GOOD, THAT'S A TRAIT OF A GOOD HUMAN BEING TO DO THAT BY THE WAY. IT DOESN'T, IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU WEAK TO CONSIDER THE FEELINGS AND PLIGHT OF OTHER PEOPLE.
POD1000000042_S0000157	HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE TRUE BECAUSE THE STRONGEST PEOPLE WE KNOW TAKE THAT THING INTO CONSIDERATION AND GO FIGHT AND DIE FOR IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY GODDAMN SENSE.
POD1000000042_S0000158	BUT SOMEHOW WE'VE APPLIED THAT POLITICALLY WHERE IT'S SOMEHOW PERCEIVED AS A WEAKNESS OR DISLOYAL TO AGREE WITH A FACT. LIKE NO DUDE, THIS IS INFORMATION.
POD1000000042_S0000160	YOU'RE JUST GET OUT OF HERE WITH THAT STUFF, BUT WE CAN'T DO IT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. I DON'T KNOW WHY.
POD1000000042_S0000161	I DON'T EITHER AND SPEAKING OF POLITICS, DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAD A POLITICAL HANGOVER TODAY WHEN YOU GOT UP AND STARTED THE DAY? BECAUSE NOW, LOOK, IT'S MONDAY. WE'RE RECORDING THIS ON MONDAY.
POD1000000042_S0000162	YOU WAKE UP, YOU WALK THE STREETS, YOU GET TO TALK TO PEOPLE OR SEE PEOPLE'S EXPRESSIONS. WHAT'S YOUR FEELING TODAY?
POD1000000042_S0000163	SO MY WIFE AND I WERE DOWNTOWN ON SATURDAY SHORTLY AFTER THEY MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND PEOPLE WERE DRIVING AROUND HONKING AND GREAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE HAPPY FOR THEIR SIDE.
POD1000000042_S0000164	BUT THE BIGGEST REALIZATION FOR ME AND ONE I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S COMING.
POD1000000042_S0000165	THE REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE LAYING IN WAIT, BUT THEY'VE GOT SOME. THERE'S JUST THIS EERIE FEELING. BUT MY WHOLE TAKEAWAY FROM THIS IS ONE, PEOPLE NEED TO BE JUST SO LESS POLARIZED.
POD1000000042_S0000166	AND SO LESS EMOTIONAL. AND I KNOW THAT'S MAINLY THE LEFT. BUT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME WAY TOO FREAKING BIG.
POD1000000042_S0000167	AND THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. AND IT NEEDS TO BE PUSHED DOWN TO THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL, AS IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED. AND IT WILL PUT LESS EMPHASIS ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF WE END UP DOING THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000168	OH, YOU MEAN LIKE THE 10TH AMENDMENT SAYS TO YOU?
POD1000000042_S0000169	YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000170	I MEAN, IT WAS ONE OF THE BILL OF GODDAMN RIGHTS. MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY OR WE JUST DO WHATEVER WHO CARES.
POD1000000042_S0000171	IF THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY WASN'T SO MESSED UP.
POD1000000042_S0000172	I MEAN, THE IDEAS HAVEN'T BEEN FLESHED OUT. THEY'RE TOO, THEY'RE TOO YOUNG. THEIR ECONOMIC POLICIES ARE NONSENSE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, NOBODY'S GOING TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS APPLICABLE, APPLICABLE.
POD1000000042_S0000173	AND SCALABLE, NOT JUST A GOOD IDEA. IT'S WE'RE IN 2020 NOW. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD BE GREAT IS IF THIS LIKE, YEAH, IT WOULD BE GREAT, BUT THAT'S NOT FUCKING REALITY.
POD1000000042_S0000174	YOU ALSO NEED A POPULAR CANDIDATE.
POD1000000042_S0000175	WELL, YEAH, I MEAN...
POD1000000042_S0000176	THAT WILL GO OUT THERE AND AND YOU'VE GOT TO SOMEBODY'S GOT TO TURN THE TIDE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
POD1000000042_S0000177	WAS THEIR PR PERSON BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE JOE JORGENSEN ON ANY NEWS STATION EVER. LIKE I KNOW SHE MADE APPEARANCES HERE AND THERE, BUT YOU NEED,
POD1000000042_S0000178	EVEN HERE, MAN.
POD1000000042_S0000179	IF YOU'RE TRYING TO START A NEW PARTY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A GOOD 30, 40 PEOPLE ALL SAYING THE SAME EXACT SHIT ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND BEING ABLE TO DEFEND THOSE POINTS AS WELL. LIKE WE BELIEVE THIS BECAUSE OF THIS. CHALLENGE ME ON THAT. MAYBE I CAN, I CAN FLEX ON IT A LITTLE BIT.
POD1000000042_S0000180	BUT HERE'S WHY WE BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE. WHAT DO YOU GUYS BELIEVE? OH, WELL, HERE'S WHY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING RIGHT NOW ISN'T IS RIGHT TECHNICALLY, BUT IN APPLICATION, IT WON'T WORK. RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000181	AND HERE'S THE LAST 40 YEARS OF PROOF OF THAT. NOW LET'S TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. BUT NO, IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S JUST LIKE, THEY'LL SHOW NOT INFRINGING.
POD1000000042_S0000182	YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000183	FUCKING FUCK THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM. I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T REALLY TELL ME ANYTHING. I NEED INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE A DECISION. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
POD1000000042_S0000184	RIGHT. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT. EVEN WITH JO JORGENSEN, WE HAD HER VP CANDIDATE ON THE SHOW, SPIKE
POD1000000042_S0000186	AND THE PROMISE INITIALLY WAS, HEY MAN, JOE JORGENSEN'S GONNA COME ON NEXT WEEK OR WHATEVER. SHE DIDN'T END UP COMING ON THE SHOW.
POD1000000042_S0000187	PROBABLY BECAUSE I LIT HIM UP A LITTLE BIT FOR SEEING DUMB SHIT
POD1000000042_S0000188	EITHER WAY, MAN, YOU DON'T TURN DOWN 10.3 MILLION LISTENERS, RIGHT? YOU TRY TO GET YOUR MESSAGE OUT THERE DESPITE WHATEVER IT IS, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GO OUT TO AN AUDIENCE OF THIS SIZE ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW.
POD1000000042_S0000189	YOU WOULDN'T GET IT ON JIMMY FALLON IF YOU'RE GOING ON JIMMY FALLON. SO NO MATTER IF PEOPLE ARE GONNA CHALLENGE YOU OR NOT, YOU STILL WANNA GET YOUR MESSAGE OUT TO THE LISTENERS. AND I ALSO THINK, AGAIN, YOU NEED A CANDIDATE IN THAT PARTY WHO IS POPULAR ENOUGH TO SAY, ALL RIGHT,
POD1000000042_S0000190	WE'RE GOING TO START VOTING FOR THIS. WE'RE GOING TO START TAKING THIS PARTY SERIOUSLY, REGARDLESS OF IT TAKES VOTES AWAY FROM ONE OF THE OTHER. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARGUMENTS, RIGHT? IS SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AFRAID TO RUN DOWN THE MIDDLE WITH THE
POD1000000042_S0000192	THAT'S GOING TO TAKE VOTES FROM THIS OTHER CANDIDATE. YOU HAVE TO STOP BEING AFRAID OF THAT. YES, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE VOTES FROM ANOTHER CANDIDATE, BUT IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A SERIOUS THIRD PARTY,
POD1000000042_S0000193	SOMEONE'S GOT TO START IT AND IT'S GOT TO BE SERIOUS AND THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME FINANCIAL BACKING BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY THERE.
POD1000000042_S0000194	NO, ROSS PRODUS PAID FOR HIMSELF.
POD1000000042_S0000195	YES.
POD1000000042_S0000196	AND THAT'S WHY I SAID, I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR THIS BEFORE, BUT I THINK BLOOMBERG SHOULD HAVE RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT. I THINK THAT BERNIE SANDERS SHOULD HAVE RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT. I THINK MITT ROMNEY SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
POD1000000042_S0000197	HMM.
POD1000000042_S0000198	LOOK, THIS ISN'T ABOUT A VERSUS B. THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK IS BEST FOR MY GODDAMN COUNTRY, RIGHT? WHAT IS ALL THIS THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THAT MADE THIS WORTH ALL THE FUCKING BLOOD THAT'S BEEN SHED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?
POD1000000042_S0000199	LOOK, WE HAD THIS IDEA THAT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE THINK WE CAN GOVERN OUR ENTIRE LIVES AROUND IT, AND WE SENT MEN TO BATTLE FOR IT FOR YEARS, OVER AND OVER.
POD1000000042_S0000200	ONE MAJOR WAR EVERY 20 YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY TO SUPPORT THAT FUCKING IDEA. SHOW ME WHERE THE FUCKING VALUE IS IN THAT NOW. LIKE SHOW ME WHAT FUCKING REVERENCE IS BEING GIVEN BACK TO THAT FUCKING PROMISE
POD1000000042_S0000201	IN THAT SACRIFICE JUST SO YOU CAN SPIT IN A COP'S FACE AND COMPLAIN ABOUT FASCISM IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS NEVER SEEN FASCISM. LET'S BE REAL. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
POD1000000042_S0000203	I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYTHING IN AMERICAN POLITICS CAN BE FIXED WITH VOTING AT THIS POINT. HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK IT CAN UNTIL PEOPLE CHANGE THE WAY THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG.
POD1000000042_S0000204	RIGHT IS NOT CORRECT AND LEFT IS NOT CORRECT. CORRECT IS CORRECT, BITCH.
POD1000000042_S0000205	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000206	THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD SAY, WELL, THAT'S A REPUBLICAN TALKING POINT. ANYTHING THAT'S A TALKING POINT TO ME IS BULLSHIT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT. PROVE IT, THEN I'LL BELIEVE IT. THIS IS NOT GOD. IT WAS 2020.
POD1000000042_S0000208	I HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE WORLD ON THIS LITTLE DEVICE RIGHT HERE AND SOMEHOW WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO AGREE ON FUCKING REALITY.
POD1000000042_S0000209	AND IT'S NOT COMING ANYTIME SOON.
POD1000000042_S0000210	IS IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE OLD TRIBAL LINES ANYMORE BECAUSE OF GLOBALISM? LIKE WE DON'T, I CAN'T JUST LIKE DISLIKE THE OTHER COUNTRY AND TAKE CARE OF MINE BECAUSE I HAVE TO LIKE EVERYBODY NOW. IS THAT IT? IS THAT REALLY WHAT IT IS? I MEAN, ARE WE THAT FUCKING PATHETIC?
POD1000000042_S0000211	TO YOUR POINT ABOUT ALL THE BLOODSHED, IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN PEOPLE'S MINDS, IF IT'S EVEN THERE AT ALL. THERE'S A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT IN AMERICA.
POD1000000042_S0000212	THAT AMERICANS ARE ALMOST ENTITLED FOR SOLDIERS GOING FORWARD OVERSEAS AND GIVING THEIR LIVES AND THEY'RE GOING TO TUNE INTO THE KARDASHIANS OR WHATEVER TV SHOW IS POPULAR.
POD1000000042_S0000213	SO THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY YEARS ON NOVEMBER 11TH, I USUALLY GO TO OTTAWA TO CELEBRATE WITH SOME CANADIAN.
POD1000000042_S0000215	WE HAVE TWO GUYS THAT ARE THE VERSION OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS.
POD1000000042_S0000216	HMM.
POD1000000042_S0000217	AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A COUNTRY LIKE
POD1000000042_S0000219	LET'S SAY THE UNITED KINGDOM, CELEBRATE A HOLIDAY LIKE THAT. AMERICANS DON'T CELEBRATE VETERANS DAY ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT CANADA AND BRITAIN DO. EVERYONE STOPS.
POD1000000042_S0000220	EVERY TOWN HAS A MEMORIAL. EVERYONE'S WEARING A RED POPPY. YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH UNITY. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SAD TO SAY THAT I SERVED 20 YEARS AND EVERY 11TH OF NOVEMBER, I DO MY BEST TO MAKE IT TO CANADA.
POD1000000042_S0000221	REALLY.
POD1000000042_S0000222	YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000223	NO SHIT.
POD1000000042_S0000224	YES.
POD1000000042_S0000226	THIS WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR BECAUSE ONE, THE COVID RESTRICTIONS AND TWO, THE LAUNCH OF THE BOOK.
POD1000000042_S0000227	YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000228	BUT, YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000229	THAT'S CRAZY. THAT'S CRAZY. YEAH, ME PERSONALLY, AS FAR AS POLITICAL HANGOVER GOES TODAY, I TYPICALLY WATCH THE, THERE'S A TODAY SHOW OR SOMETHING ON IN THE MORNING AS I'M GETTING READY.
POD1000000042_S0000230	FOR WORK JUST TO KIND OF CATCH UP ON THE NEWS. THIS WAS THE FIRST DAY THAT IT WASN'T DOMINATED BY MADNESS OVER TRUMP AND ANGER OVER TRUMP AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
POD1000000042_S0000231	THEY ALMOST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO TALK ABOUT ON THE NEWS, YOU KNOW THERE WAS A COUPLE THINGS OF LIKE HEY, THERE WAS A CELEBRATION OF BIDEN AND HARRISON
POD1000000042_S0000233	THEY SEEM LOST WHEN THEY COULDN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REGARDING TRUMP.
POD1000000042_S0000234	AND WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000235	LIKE THAT'S I WAS TRYING TO GUESS THAT EARLIER ON
POD1000000042_S0000237	REVOLUTION. WHAT IS IT? WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO TALK ABOUT?
POD1000000042_S0000238	BUT PROVIDED THINGS STAY AS THEY ARE WITH THESE COUNTS, WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO PROSECUTE BIDEN FOR THE RUSSIA BULLSHIT, WHICH IS HILARIOUS, BY THE WAY.
POD1000000042_S0000240	SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
POD1000000042_S0000241	FOR NO FOR THAT, BUT HIS INVOLVEMENT IN IT, WHICH WE KNOW HE HAD SOME OF IT. DON'T DON'T BE NAIVE. LET'S LET'S JUST BE ADULTS HERE.
POD1000000042_S0000242	YEAH, THE BIG GUY.
POD1000000042_S0000243	WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. WE WILL SEE. IT PROBABLY IS. I MEAN, IT DEFINITELY PASSES THE SMELL TEST AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE EMAILS ARE LEGIT NOW. NOT NECESSARILY. WE DON'T KNOW THAT BIDEN'S THE BIG GUY NECESSARILY. WE KNOW THOSE EMAILS ARE LEGIT.

POD1000000042_S0000420	WHAT ABOUT ME?
POD1000000042_S0000421	NO, NOT.
POD1000000042_S0000423	I DO DEFINITELY LIKE WINE. I, IT'S, IT'S, IT'S, I HAD THE BENEFIT, I GUESS, IF YOU WANT TO, IF THESE DAYS YOU DEFINITELY CAN'T CALL IT THAT, BUT IF YOU COULD EVER CALL THE CALL LIVING IN THE BAY AREA, THE BENEFIT OF IN ANY WAY IT WAS BECAUSE I COULD GO TO WINE COUNTRY WHENEVER I WANTED TO.
POD1000000042_S0000424	TRUE.
POD1000000042_S0000425	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000426	CIAO.
POD1000000042_S0000427	AND IT'S VERY DIVERSE, LIKE GRAPES ARE VERY DIVERSE, THEY TASTE DIFFERENT TO ME. SO I ENJOY IT. SO IF YOU'RE A WINE CONNOISSEUR OR IF YOU JUST LIKE IT OR YOU'RE TRYING TO GET INTO IT OR WHATEVER IT IS, OR IF YOU JUST WANT GOOD WINE, THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO GO.
POD1000000042_S0000428	IT IS. YOU GET SIX BOTTLES FOR $30.
POD1000000042_S0000429	FOR ANY LEVEL THAT YOU, FOR A WINE CLUB, FOR ANY LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE WITH WINE YOU HAVE, YOU CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT RANDOM BULLSHIT AND THEY CAN TELL YOU KIND OF WHAT YOUR FLAVOR PALETTE IS, BUT IF YOU HAVE MORE PRECISE INFORMATION, YOU CAN DO THAT AS WELL.
POD1000000042_S0000430	HMM.
POD1000000042_S0000431	AND THEN IT GRADUATES SO EVERY NEW WINE CHIP YOU GET SHOULD BE CLOSER TO YOUR OWN PARTICULAR TASTE, WHICH IS GOOD, RIGHT? THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD WORK, PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER USED IT BEFORE.
POD1000000042_S0000432	THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT'S LIKE HAVING YOUR OWN FUCKING WINE BUTLER BASICALLY.
POD1000000042_S0000433	IT'S AMAZING. SO THEY'LL SEND YOU THE SIX BOTTLES, YOU TRY THEM OUT, YOU LET THEM KNOW IF YOU LIKE THEM, AND THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE ON LIKE THAT. IN THE MEANTIME, AGAIN, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TURN DOWN SIX BOTTLES FOR $30?
POD1000000042_S0000434	REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR SITUATION IS.

POD1000000042_S0000444	NAH, I REALLY, I DON'T, I DON'T.
POD1000000042_S0000446	SPENDING CHRISTMAS WITHOUT FAMILY. I DON'T HAVE MY GIRLS THIS YEAR, SO IT'S GONNA BE PEACEFUL, IT'S GONNA BE NICE, BUT I'LL GET THAT WINE, PUT IT UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE, FORGET THAT I GOT IT.
POD1000000042_S0000448	AND THEN WHEN I OPEN IT UP, I'LL GET DRUNK.

POD1000000042_S0000453	PROUD OF YOU. YEAH, I HAD A BUNCH THIS WEEKEND, MAN, AFTER THIS ELECTION. I DON'T, DAN AND I HAVE SHIED AWAY FROM THE BEERS, OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU HIT YOUR EARLY 30S.
POD1000000042_S0000454	YEAH, YOU'LL LOOK LIKE ME.
POD1000000042_S0000456	RIGHT, DAN?
POD1000000042_S0000457	I'LL NEVER GET THERE.
POD1000000042_S0000458	IT'S A LOT OF A LOT OF SELTZERS THESE DAYS. WITH THIS ONE I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING ALL IN. I WAS AT TWISTED X BREWERY AND YESTERDAY.
POD1000000042_S0000459	WOULD YOU, WOULD YOU, WHAT WERE YOU HAMMERING DOWN?
POD1000000042_S0000460	THE BIG DOGS. THEY GOT SOME APVS THAT ARE 8% LAST NIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000461	YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000462	I THINK IS WHAT IT WAS CALLED. THEY'VE GOT THE MCCONAUGHEY'S, THEY'RE FAMOUS FOR THAT ONE.
POD1000000042_S0000463	I JUST DON'T LIKE HOW BLOATED I FEEL FOR LIKE TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS, LIKE HOW FAT I FEEL.
POD1000000042_S0000464	THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL TODAY. BUT I ALSO KNEW IT, RIGHT? I WAS GOING INTO THE WEEKEND AND I WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, COOL.
POD1000000042_S0000465	YOU GET THE MINDSET.
POD1000000042_S0000466	YEAH, BECAUSE I DIDN'T FIND OUT DAN AND I COLLECTIVELY SOMEBODY TALLIED IT UP. WE DID 58 HOURS WORTH OF PODCASTS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS. I SLEPT. I WAS PRETTY SICK. LIKE SATURDAY, MY BODY JUST GAVE OUT. I WAS PRETTY SICK.
POD1000000042_S0000467	AND I SLEPT MOST OF THE FUCKING WEEKEND, MAN. AND I DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THE ELECTION UNTIL I THINK LIKE 6.30 THAT NIGHT, SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN I WOKE UP AND I WAS LIKE, OH SHIT, THEY HAD ACTUALLY CALLED THIS.
POD1000000042_S0000468	MIKE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER HERE. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO IT? YOU THINK IT'S REAL?
POD1000000042_S0000469	OH, WHICH PART?
POD1000000042_S0000470	THE LIKE THE THE MAIL IN BALLOTING AND
POD1000000042_S0000471	I MEAN, LOOK, I THINK IT'S OVER, RIGHT? I MEAN, THE ELECTION'S OVER. THIS ONE'S OVER. I JUST HOPE THAT THE REPUBLICANS DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE THAT I FEEL LIKE THE DEMOCRATS DID OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND JUST TRY TO FIGHT OUT MISTAKES. AND I HOPE THIS ISN'T THEIR TAGLINE.
POD1000000042_S0000472	LIKE RUSSIA WAS FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. I HOPE THAT, LOOK, I DO THINK WE NEED TO DO JUSTICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM WAS, THAT IT WAS FAIR.
POD1000000042_S0000473	MMM.
POD1000000042_S0000474	BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, LIKE, OKAY, HEY, WE LOST. WE JUST NEED TO SAY IT. OKAY, WE LOST. WE GOT BEAT.
POD1000000042_S0000475	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000476	WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. LET'S DON'T PLAY THE VICTIM CARD OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
POD1000000042_S0000477	SO THAT KIND OF BEGS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL THIS, RIGHT? IS THE POINT FOR YOUR TEAM TO WIN OR IS THE POINT FOR AMERICA TO WIN? AND IT'S WHY I CHALLENGE THE BINARY POLITICAL SYSTEM ITSELF.
POD1000000042_S0000478	REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTS VERSUS LEFT TALKING OR LIBERAL TALKING POINTS INTO WIN VERSUS LOSE OR WIN VERSUS LOSE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU SEE THE WORLD, RIGHT? THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
POD1000000042_S0000479	THERE ARE RIGHT AND WRONG ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS AND WE'VE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO PIGEONHOLE OURSELVES INTO ONE OF TWO CHOICES AND EVERY FUCKING YEAR PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
POD1000000042_S0000480	CAN YOU BELIEVE WE GOTTA CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE TWO ASSHOLES AGAIN? IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.
POD1000000042_S0000481	YEP.
POD1000000042_S0000482	EVERY BIT OF IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU. IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU, YOU, ME. WE'RE ALL ASSHOLES.
POD1000000042_S0000483	BUT, I MEAN, YEAH, I MEAN, I THINK OUR SYSTEM, I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE DANGER OF DEMOCRACY, RIGHT? LIKE, THERE'S A DANGER TO IT. LIKE, IT'S KIND OF LIKE A GUN.
POD1000000042_S0000484	IT CAN BE A VERY, VERY POWERFUL TOOL THAT CAN FEED YOUR FAMILY, PROTECT YOUR FAMILY. IT CAN LITERALLY BE USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS, RIGHT? BUT IT CAN ALSO BE THE SAME THING THAT KILLS YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY, RIGHT? IN THE WRONG HANDS.
POD1000000042_S0000485	AND NOT USED WITH INTEGRITY AND NOT KNOWING THE SYSTEM BEING VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE TOOL AND ALL THESE THINGS. AND WHAT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EDUCATED ON HOW OUR SYSTEM WORKS.
POD1000000042_S0000486	WHO AREN'T EDUCATED ON IT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING AND THEY'RE PUTTING INTO POWER, THEY'RE USING THIS AS SOME REALITY TV SHOW OR LIKE THEY'RE BETTING ON SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, RIGHT? IT'S DONE WITH THE SAME MINDSET.
POD1000000042_S0000487	AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WITH DEMOCRACY IT CAN BE THE BEST TOOL TO GIVE THE FREEST COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. BUT IT CAN BE A SYSTEM THAT IMPLODES ON ITSELF AND TURNS EVERYBODY AGAINST EACH OTHER BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH FREEDOM, RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000488	COMMUNISM IS A MORE SYSTEMATIC, BUREAUCRATIC APPROACH TO SOMETHING, RIGHT? LIKE IT'S REGULATED. IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE MILITARY. COMMUNISM IS KIND OF LIKE HOW THE MILITARY COULD BE, RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000489	OR SOCIALISM, SOCIALISM IS THE MILITARY SOCIALISM. PRETTY MUCH, SOCIALISM. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE DEMOCRACY AND YOU HAVE ALL THIS FREEDOM AND ALL THIS POWER, YOU PUT IT IN THE WRONG HANDS.
POD1000000042_S0000490	IT CAN BE THE SAME. THE SAME THING THAT MAKES YOU FREE CAN ALSO BE THE SAME THING THAT KILLS US.
POD1000000042_S0000491	RIGHT, IT CAN. I MEAN, AND THAT'S WHY THERE WILL NEVER BE A SUCCESSFUL SOCIALIST COUNTRY EVER IS BECAUSE IT INEVITABLY TURNS TO COMMUNISM. NOW, WHAT WE FOUND ABOUT FREE MARKET CAPITALISM AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS IT CAN THRIVE PRETTY WELL.
POD1000000042_S0000492	WITHOUT THAT HAPPENING WITHOUT IT TURNING TO FASCISM FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH IS A FAR RIGHT IDEOLOGY BUT FOR SOME I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A CORRECTIVE MEASURE THAT SOCIETY'S TAKEN OR WHATEVER OR IF PEOPLE ARE JUST WEAK
POD1000000042_S0000493	BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE IDEA OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IS GONE BY THE WAYSIDE FOR THE MOST PART.
POD1000000042_S0000494	WHERE THERE IS NO...
POD1000000042_S0000495	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000496	THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY.
POD1000000042_S0000497	RIGHT. SO YOU ARE AFFORDED IN AMERICA, YOU'RE AFFORDED THE PRIVILEGE. IT'S NOT A RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAD TO FIGHT FOR THIS SHIT. IT IS A PRIVILEGE. YOU'RE AFFORDED THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY LIKE CAPITALISM
POD1000000042_S0000498	WITHOUT THE BULLSHIT FROM A SOCIETY LIKE SOCIALISM OR COMMUNISM WHERE PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO ALL THE TIME. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE. BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON...
POD1000000042_S0000499	AND TO ALLOW THESE WHAT SEEMED LIKE SIMPLE COMFORTS INTO YOUR LIFE AT THE TIME OR MAYBE THEY'RE NOT BAD ENOUGH TO REALLY GO AFTER.
POD1000000042_S0000500	WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THIS GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WELL RESPECTED FACET OF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM, RIGHT? OTHERWISE WE'RE FUCKED.
POD1000000042_S0000501	BUT LOOK, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ACROSS THE BOARD RIGHT NOW IN OUR POLITICS AND ACROSS THE WORLD, OR ACROSS THE BOARD OF AMERICA, IS THE REPERCUSSIONS
POD1000000042_S0000502	OF TAKING THE EASY ROAD. LOOK AT THE BABY BOOMERS. THEY WERE PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST GENERATIONS THAT DECIDED TO BECOME THE VICTIMS.
POD1000000042_S0000503	HMM.
POD1000000042_S0000504	A GREATER DIS YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000505	I MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CULTURE THAT ONCE YOU BECOME PROTECTED, YOU START LOOKING INWARD.
POD1000000042_S0000506	EXACTLY. AND SO LIKE THEY STARTED THEY STARTED THAT MINDSET AND NOW THEIR CHILDREN STARTED GETTING PARTICIPATION TROPHIES. RIGHT. AND NOW YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE SOCIETY THAT'S VOTING RIGHT NOW.
POD1000000042_S0000507	NOBODY WANTS TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT I FUCKING LOST SO I NEED TO GO BACK AND WORK ON SOMETHING
POD1000000042_S0000508	RIGHT, NO, WE'RE A BUNCH OF DULL BLADES.
POD1000000042_S0000509	WE'RE A BUNCH OF DULL BLADES.
POD1000000042_S0000510	BASICALLY, WE'VE NEVER SEEN STEEL BEFORE. WE'VE NEVER BEEN SHARPENED.
POD1000000042_S0000511	BUT ON THE BACKSIDE OF IT, THE MILITARY THAT WE HAVE AND THE FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE IS SECOND TO NONE AND IT'S PROVIDED THE SAME, LIKE WE HAVE EMPOWERED THE PROBLEM.
POD1000000042_S0000512	RIGHT BECAUSE WE'VE HAD MEN AND WOMEN WHO'VE BEEN WILLING TO RAISE THEIR RIGHT HANDS AND DIDN'T HAVE TO WE'VE HAD PEOPLE WILLING TO GO OUT AND AND PROTECT OUR SOCIETY AND STILL STAND UP AND
POD1000000042_S0000513	WHEN IT'S NOT POPULAR IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION, PEOPLE HAVE STILL BEEN WILLING TO DO THIS AND WE'RE BASICALLY ENABLING THIS BEHAVIOR TO CONTINUE. WE GOT POLICE PROTECTING THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING, FUCK THE POLICE.
POD1000000042_S0000514	GREAT.
POD1000000042_S0000515	YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND SO.
POD1000000042_S0000516	AND THERE'S NO SOCIAL COST TO BE PAID.
POD1000000042_S0000518	AND THE PROPS? THAT IS A PROBLEM.
POD1000000042_S0000519	AND THE PROBLEM IS, IS WHEN THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES TO YOUR ACTIONS. AND I BLAME 80% OF THIS ON ONE PIECE OF AMERICA.
POD1000000042_S0000520	AND THAT'S BIG TECH.
POD1000000042_S0000522	BIG TECH.
POD1000000042_S0000523	YEAH, YEAH, AND I'M WITH YOU. UNTIL THESE THINGS BECOME PUBLIC UTILITIES.
POD1000000042_S0000524	IT'S GONNA GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AND LOOK, WE SAW IT IN THIS ELECTION WHERE, I MEAN, SHIT, LOOK, BETWEEN THIS AND ROSS PATTERSON REVOLUTION, I'VE DONE AROUND 1,500 EPISODES OF PODCASTS.
POD1000000042_S0000525	I'VE NEVER BEEN CENSORED BEFORE. WE'VE BEEN SHADOW BANNED ON THIS SHOW, THAT SHOW. I EVEN HAD A SOCIAL MEDIA POST ON FACEBOOK THAT WAS SHADOW BANNED THIS MORNING. I DID AN ELECTION SHOW.
POD1000000042_S0000526	AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT POPS UP ON YOUTUBE IF YOU SAY THE WORD ELECTION NOW THAT SAYS THE AP HAS CALLED THE ELECTION FOR JOE BIDEN AND FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS AND IT WAS POINTED OUT TO BY THE LISTENERS AND I WAS
POD1000000042_S0000527	BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT IN THE AP'S POWER TO CALL AN ELECTION OR ANY OTHER MEDIA OUTLET. IT'S ONLY WITH THE ELECTORS AND THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION TO DO THAT. AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL AT THE EARLIEST DECEMBER 13TH.
POD1000000042_S0000528	AND IT, AND IT, RIGHT. AND IT, BY THE WAY, SO UNDERNEATH IT, UM, ON YOUTUBE, IF YOU'RE, IF YOU'RE DOING A VIDEO, UM, IT, IT PUTS, IT'S GOT A WEBSITE ON IT. UH, C I S A.GOV SLASH RUMOR CONTROL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT THIS IS. I CLICKED IT.
POD1000000042_S0000529	AND IT SAYS IT'S THE NATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR ELECTION SECURITY AND IT SAYS MIS AND DISINFORMATION CAN UNDERMINE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AS WELL IN OUR DEMOCRACY.
POD1000000042_S0000530	PEOPLE WILL LEAVE FOR THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000531	YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000532	WAIT FOR THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000533	YEAH, YOU SHOULD HAVE RAN THAT AD 15 YEARS AGO.
POD1000000042_S0000534	BUT THEY'RE DOING IT NOW, CURRENTLY NOW, ON VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE, AND IT KEEPS GETTING SCARIER AND SCARIER WHERE YOU'RE JUST LIKE, WELL, WHAT THE FUCK IS NEXT?
POD1000000042_S0000535	WELL, HERE'S WHAT I DON'T LIKE. I DON'T WANT WHEN ANY KIND OF PRIVATE ORGANIZATION AND LOOK, WE ALL SUPPORT PRIVATE BUSINESS HERE, BUT WE HAVE TO BE FUCKING PRAGMATIST AS WELL. WHEN ANY PRIVATE ORGANIZATION GETS THAT POWERFUL, THEN THEIR VOICE BECOMES LOUDER THAN YOURS.
POD1000000042_S0000536	AND WHEN THEIR VOICE BECOMES LOUDER, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TWO CHOICES TO LISTEN TO THAT VOICE OR TO DEVELOP A LOUDER VOICE THEMSELVES. AND THE ONLY WAY THE GOVERNMENT DEVELOPS A LOUDER VOICE IS BY TAKING VOICE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE IN BOTH OF THESE CASES.
POD1000000042_S0000537	OKAY.
POD1000000042_S0000538	THERE IS NO GOOD SOLUTION.
POD1000000042_S0000539	BUT I DON'T KNOW. THERE IS. I DISAGREE. THERE IS A GOOD SOLUTION WITH BIG TECH. IF I GO BUY A GUN, A GUN HAS TO BE REGISTERED TO SOMEBODY'S NAME.
POD1000000042_S0000540	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000541	IT HAS TO BE.
POD1000000042_S0000542	YES.
POD1000000042_S0000543	RIGHT. SO IF I'M GOING TO GO AND CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND USE THIS PLATFORM THAT CAN BE USED TO TO TO EMOTIONALLY CHARGE PEOPLE INTO THE MASS, YOU KNOW, GATHER PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR A CAUSE.
POD1000000042_S0000544	THAT SHOULD HAVE TO BE REGISTERED TO SOMEBODY'S NAME BECAUSE WHY IS THAT GUN REGISTERED TO SOMEBODY'S NAME? SO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
POD1000000042_S0000545	SO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS BASICALLY THE WAY TELEPHONES WORK, WHICH IS A PUBLIC UTILITY THING AND IT MAKES SENSE. PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD REGISTER AND THAT DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE.
POD1000000042_S0000546	OKAY, SO IT LIKE
POD1000000042_S0000547	BECAUSE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH POWER DO WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE? DO WE NOT DO WE NOT WANT THE CAPABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER ANONYMOUSLY OVER THE INTERNET? WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000548	NOT WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH THAT'S NOT THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE THE ONE
POD1000000042_S0000549	RIGHT? BUT WHO WOULD IT BE THEN?
POD1000000042_S0000550	WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF BIG TECH, IF I'M GOING TO CREATE A PLATFORM AND IT'S GOING TO BE MY PLATFORM, THEN IF, IF THIS ACCOUNT BREAKS THE LAW.
POD1000000042_S0000551	LIKE THEY BREAK THE LAW THAT WE ALREADY HAVE SET TOWARDS SPEECH. IF I LOOK AT YOU AND I SAY, HEY ROSS, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU. YOU CAN GO CALL THE COPS RIGHT NOW AND I'M GOING TO JAIL BECAUSE YOU HAVE PROOF OF IT.
POD1000000042_S0000552	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000553	RIGHT? SO THE SAME THING SHOULD BE WITH THE SAME SHIT AS TEXT MESSAGES. IT SHOULD BE THE SAME THING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. THAT IF SOMETHING IS SAID THAT BREAKS THE LAW, THERE SHOULD BE NO CENSORSHIP DECIDED FROM A PRIVATE PARTY.
POD1000000042_S0000554	IF THIS ACCOUNT BREAKS THE LAW, THEN GUESS WHAT? I COME TO YOU AS YOUR BIG TECH, ALL YOU ARE IS A VAULT, AND IT'S VERIFIED THESE PEOPLE, THAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS FAR AS IT GOES TO CENSORSHIP.
POD1000000042_S0000555	AND I COME TO YOU AND SAY, WHO IS THIS ACCOUNT REGISTERED TO? AND THEN THAT PERSON IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR BREAKING THE LAW.
POD1000000042_S0000556	SO INSTEAD OF WHAT SECTION 230 DOES, WHICH IS BASICALLY ABSOLVE PEOPLE OF OUR ABSOLVED TECH COMPANIES OF ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF THEIR PURVIEW THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED ON THEIR PLATFORM.
POD1000000042_S0000557	YOU WOULD RECOMMEND SOMETHING LIKE THE TECH COMPANIES JUST BEING COMPLICIT OR COMPLIANT RATHER WITH THE GOVERNMENT PROSECUTING CASE. I UNDERSTAND THAT IN PRINCIPLE.
POD1000000042_S0000558	ABSOLUTELY.
POD1000000042_S0000559	BUT IMAGINE A GOVERNMENT WHERE AOC IS IN CHARGE AND SHE'S MAKING LISTS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED TRUMP
POD1000000042_S0000560	DUDE, IT'S ALL BUT IT'S ALL BUT I'M SAYING IT, BUT I'M SAYING IT'S ALREADY
POD1000000042_S0000561	I KNOW I GOT IT, I'M JUST PLAYING DEVIL'S AVOCADO HERE BECAUSE...
POD1000000042_S0000562	WELL, THEN THAT GOES BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE VOTING IN PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN TRUST THAT HAVE THAT POWER.
POD1000000042_S0000563	YEAH, BUT WHEN HAVE WE DONE THAT? WHO'S THE LAST FUCKING PRESIDENT THAT YOU TRUSTED?
POD1000000042_S0000564	THEN WHAT DO WE DO?
POD1000000042_S0000565	I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I THINK WE NEED AN OVERHAUL OF THIS ENTIRE ELECTORAL SYSTEM.
POD1000000042_S0000566	WELL, I MEAN, I THINK MORE THE BIGGER PROBLEM TO ALL THIS IS THAT THE FACT THAT HONESTLY THIS PRESIDENT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE OUR THREE LIVES HERE. THIS PRESIDENT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY DECISIONS THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT MY LIFE OR CHANGE WHAT I DO EVERY SINGLE DAY.
POD1000000042_S0000567	IT'S GOING TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY, I DON'T INVEST IN STOCKS. SO I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THAT. I'LL BET I'LL GAMBLE ON MY OWN MONEY. I'LL GO AND I'LL INVEST IT IN PROPERTY OR I'LL DO IT LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE ON MY PERFORMANCE.
POD1000000042_S0000568	LIKE THIS THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT GONNA AFFECT IT'S GONNA AFFECT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF THE FUTURE FOR ME
POD1000000042_S0000569	YEAH, AND I'VE SAID THIS A BUNCH OF TIMES IN THE PAST WHERE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE THIS HEATED OVER A PRESIDENT, RIGHT, AND IT AFFECTS YOUR LIFE DAY TO DAY, CHANCES ARE YOU GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS, RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000570	BECAUSE LOOK.
POD1000000042_S0000571	YOU'RE PROBABLY LIVING OFF THE GOVERNMENT.
POD1000000042_S0000572	WELL, YOU SAY THAT, BUT I MEAN...
POD1000000042_S0000573	LET'S THINK ABOUT OUR POSITION SPECIFICALLY. WE'RE ALL BUSINESS OWNERS, RIGHT? IF I DECIDE TO SELL MY BUSINESS TODAY, THEN I PAY 15% CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON IT AND THE REST IS MINE.
POD1000000042_S0000574	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000576	IN FOUR MONTHS, THERE'S A DECENT CHANCE AT LEAST THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE 23%.
POD1000000042_S0000577	YES
POD1000000042_S0000578	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000579	YES.
POD1000000042_S0000580	THAT AFFECTS MY LIFE.
POD1000000042_S0000581	IT DOES. BUT DAY TO DAY LIFE. AND THE IDEA THAT BIDEN AND HIS TEAM ARE CURRENTLY FLOATING THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE MASK WEARING MANDATORY NATIONWIDE.
POD1000000042_S0000582	I MEAN IT DIDN'T
POD1000000042_S0000583	NOT THAT THEY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SURE. THE FACT THAT THEY'RE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT, THEN YEAH, I MEAN.
POD1000000042_S0000584	IT'S ALREADY THERE.
POD1000000042_S0000585	YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT ABOUT TRUMP AND HOW HE SOUNDS DICTATORIAL SOMETIMES BECAUSE HE'S JUST AN IDIOT THAT'S NEGOTIATING IN PUBLIC AND DOESN'T REALIZE THE WEIGHT OF THE WORDS HE SAYS. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000586	BUT IT DOES SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHY HE WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HE'S NOT DOING THOSE THINGS TO BE MALICIOUS. HE'S JUST DOING IT BECAUSE HE'S A FUCKING EMOTIONAL CHILD. AND THAT'S HOW HE'S LEARNED TO NEGOTIATE OVER THE YEARS. AND SOMETIMES IT'S PRETTY GODDAMN EFFECTIVE, FRANKLY. BUT EVEN IF IT WASN'T,
POD1000000042_S0000587	IT'S JUST A STRATEGY. IT'S NOT WHO HE IS AT THE CORE OF HIS PERSON.
POD1000000042_S0000588	SO WHEN I SEE PEOPLE WHO AT THE CORE OF THEIR CHARACTER ARE ARGUING FOR THESE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE THE CHAMPION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE NOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WROTE THE BILL.
POD1000000042_S0000589	THAT PUT ALL THESE MEN IN PRISON AND THAT MY FUCKING VICE PRESIDENT ENFORCED THAT BILL IN THE BIGGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN PRISON AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000590	THAT SHOULD BE AN AWAKENING, RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000591	YEAH, BUT TO YOUR POINT IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET
POD1000000042_S0000592	NO, I DON'T THINK IT WILL.
POD1000000042_S0000594	SO AFTER HILLARY LOSING, MAYBE THERE WAS SOME CHANCE IF BIDEN HAD LOST HERE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. BUT NOW THAT BIDEN WON, WE'RE LOOKING AT ANOTHER PROBABLY 20 YEARS OF JUST CONSTANT
POD1000000042_S0000595	NO.
POD1000000042_S0000596	FRACTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
POD1000000042_S0000597	WELL, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, LOOK, I MEAN, LOOK, THE DEMOCRATS LOST IT NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT, RIGHT? THEY LOST SEATS IN THE HOUSE. YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IF THE DEMOCRATS DON'T GO BACK AND SAY, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000042_S0000598	WE BARELY LIKE LIKE DONALD TRUMP GOT BEAT. WE DIDN'T WIN. KIND OF LIKE THE REPUBLICANS PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE AS WELL LAST YOU KNOW LAST TIME.
POD1000000042_S0000599	I MEAN, BOTH OF THEM HAVE GOT TO HAVE A MAJOR OVERHAUL, BUT HERE'S WHAT I GOTTA TELL YOU IS...
POD1000000042_S0000600	WELL, THE REPUBLICANS DID DO IT. THEY CAME BACK OUT OF LOSING TO OBAMA FOR A SECOND TIME AGAINST MITT ROMNEY AND THEY CAME OUT WITH DONALD TRUMP AND WON.
POD1000000042_S0000601	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000602	THEY MADE THE ADJUSTMENT.
POD1000000042_S0000603	BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I ALSO THINK THAT THAT WAS AS MUCH I
POD1000000042_S0000604	I DON'T THINK THE RNC WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN.
POD1000000042_S0000605	NO, THEY DEFINITELY DID NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN, YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000606	BUT SO MY THING TO YOU IS, OKAY, LET'S SAY AS SOON AS WHATEVER HAPPENS, THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM COMES OUT AND DECIDES WHOEVER'S PRESIDENT IS, EITHER WAY.
POD1000000042_S0000607	IF IT IS JOE BIDEN, WHICH I TRULY BELIEVE AT THIS POINT, THE ELECTION'S OVER, WE HAVE GOT TO STOP TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE BEFORE.
POD1000000042_S0000608	AND WE'VE JUST GOT TO HOPE FOR THE GOODNESS OF THIS NATION THAT THEY COME OUT AND HAVE LEARNED FROM THE MISTAKES AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO BETTER OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
POD1000000042_S0000609	THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO. LIKE IF WE DON'T DO THAT, THEN WE ARE JUST AS BAD AS THE LEFT. LIKE WE'RE JUST AS BAD AS THE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE WE'VE GOT TO HOPE THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000610	WELL, HOW DO YOU, HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT THOUGH? HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO SUPPORT AND WHAT NOT TO SUPPORT? FOR EXAMPLE.
POD1000000042_S0000611	WELL, HOW DO YOU PICK, HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHEN DONALD TRUMP DOES SOMETHING? YOU GOTTA FORGIVE HIM FOR THIS SHIT.
POD1000000042_S0000612	THE CRIME I GOT ALL THAT YEAH FOR SURE BUT LIKE HOW DO YOU WHAT WHAT'S THE LINE HERE IF IF THE IF THE DEMOCRATS IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN
POD1000000042_S0000613	WHICH IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE. WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH VOTER FRAUD. WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF VOTER FRAUD. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OR IF IT'LL BE ENOUGH TO SWING ANYTHING. BUT ANYWAYS, IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA WIN IF THEY WIN.
POD1000000042_S0000614	THERE ARE THINGS THAT THESE GUYS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT ARE UNTENABLE FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.
POD1000000042_S0000615	YOU'RE RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000616	SHUTTING DOWN. I'M NOT A FAN OF FRACKING. I'M NOT A FAN OF LONG OIL PIPELINES BECAUSE THEY PRESENT UNNECESSARY ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES. THAT TO ME IS LAZINESS. WE COULD FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO DO IT. WE JUST HAVEN'T PUT THE EFFORT TOWARDS IT. WE PUT THE EFFORT TOWARDS
POD1000000042_S0000617	AND MONEY TOWARDS NONSENSICAL FUCKING ENERGY SUBSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT FEASIBLE AT THIS PERIOD IN TIME. WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT BETTER WAYS TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING ALREADY. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT NEW WAYS, WHICH IS STUPID, BUT ANYWAYS.
POD1000000042_S0000618	ASIDE FROM STUFF LIKE THAT, THE GREEN NEW DEAL THAT KAMALA HARRIS WAS A CO AUTHOR OF, RIGHT? THAT BIDEN SAYS, OH NO, NO, NO, BUT LOOK, HE'S SUPPORTED IT IN THEORY, RIGHT? IN THE PAST.
POD1000000042_S0000619	AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF THAT'S COMING WITH THAT PARTY, I WANT THE COUNTRY TO SUCCEED. AND THIS IS A GOOD LEARNING LESSON FOR CONSERVATIVES RIGHT NOW.
POD1000000042_S0000620	BECAUSE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT IN 2016, IN NOVEMBER OF 2016, THEY HAVE A SET OF CORE BELIEFS THAT THEY THINK ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY THE BEST IT COULD BE.
POD1000000042_S0000622	TRUMP WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT. AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS TO JUST LOSE THEIR FUCKING MINDS. NOW THAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE. SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE RIDING A TRAIN THROUGH THE CITY.
POD1000000042_S0000623	LIKE YOU'RE ON THE WRONG LINE, BUT THEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP AND I CAN GO UP TWO MORE AND THEN SWAP OVER.
POD1000000042_S0000624	THIS TRAIN IS STILL MOVING GENERALLY IN THE DIRECTION YOU NEED IT TO MOVE. SO HOW DO I FUCKING GUIDE THIS THING THE BEST I CAN OR MAKE ADJUSTMENTS?
POD1000000042_S0000625	IN THE MEANTIME, BECAUSE, BUT THERE IS A LINE THOUGH, RIGHT? LIKE IF THEY START TALKING ABOUT GREEN NEW DEAL OR, OR NATIONWIDE MANDATING OF CERTAIN THINGS THAT IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THAT'S GOING TO BE A FUCKING PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000627	LOOK, LET'S LET'S DON'T TAKE AN ASPIRIN BEFORE WE GOT A HEADACHE, RIGHT? LIKE LET'S START THIS OFF WITH THE BEST MINDSET LIKE WE DON'T NEED THIS EMOTIONALLY CHARGED LIKE WE DON'T NEED TO LIKE LOOK LET'S LET'S DON'T BE THE SAME THING THAT WE JUST BITCHED ABOUT THE LAST FOUR YEARS
POD1000000042_S0000628	WELL, IT'S HARD. I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT IT'S HARD. IT'S HARD NOT TO DO THAT WHEN AOC AND HER COLLEAGUES ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING LISTS OF PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT TRUMP. I WAS NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER.
POD1000000042_S0000629	I GOT IT.
POD1000000042_S0000630	AND I'M NOT, AND I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT AN AOC SUPPORTER EITHER, BUT IF EITHER ONE OF THOSE SIDES STARTED MAKING LISTS OF THE OTHER SIDE, I'M GOING TO HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM WITH THAT. AND ALL OF YOU SHOULD TOO.
POD1000000042_S0000631	WELL, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT ISSUES, RIGHT? LIKE
POD1000000042_S0000632	WELL, WE ARE WHEN THE LEADERS OF THE PARTY LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA AS WELL AS LIKE THESE PEOPLE THESE 70 MILLION PEOPLE DECIDED TO VOTE FOR CHAOS AND RACISM HOW ABOUT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP MICHELLE? WELL LIKE THAT I MEAN THAT'S LIKE SHE'S ONE OF THE LEADER REGARDLESS OF HAVING NEVER RUN FOR POLITICS IN HER LIFE
POD1000000042_S0000633	SHE'S ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND WHAT SHE SAYS MEANS A LOT. SO SHE JUST CALLED OUT 70 MILLION PEOPLE AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY'RE FUCKING RACIST. LIKE HOW DO YOU EXPECT, ALL THEY TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS OH WE NEED TO UNIFY AND STUFF. YEAH, OF COURSE.
POD1000000042_S0000634	YOU WANT TO UNIFY RIGHT NOW WHILE YOU'RE WINNING IN THE GAME. YOU DON'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY MORE VIOLENCE.
POD1000000042_S0000635	I'M WITH YOU. LISTEN, I AM WITH YOU. I AM WITH YOU. BUT ALL WE CAN HOPE IS THAT OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, THAT WE CAN AT LEAST LEAD BY EXAMPLE.
POD1000000042_S0000636	THAT WE DON'T TURN AROUND AND WE DON'T GRAB GUNS AND WE DON'T GO AND WE DON'T START HOLDING GUNS TO WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T COUNT OUTSIDE OF VOTING CENTERS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I'M GONNA SAY ON THE BACKSIDE OF IT, BOTH SIDES ARE FUCKED UP.
POD1000000042_S0000637	RIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000638	RIGHT, SO LIKE I'M JUST SAYING AS FAR AS US WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE A PLATFORM WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK, LET'S OKAY I GOT WE SAID WE WERE IN A FIGHT LIKE WE'RE IN A FIGHT.
POD1000000042_S0000639	WE SAID WHAT WE NEEDED TO TO GET THERE, BUT IT'S TIME TO LIKE HEY LIKE CLEAN SLATE LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO GOING FORWARD LIKE LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO GOING FORWARD
POD1000000042_S0000640	I'M GOING TO RESERVE GETTING ANGRY UNTIL THE ACTUAL POLICIES ARE IN PLACE AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000641	UNLESS IT HAPPENS BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
POD1000000042_S0000642	THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO
POD1000000042_S0000643	WE'VE GOT A STALEMATE PRESIDENT FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
POD1000000042_S0000644	YEAH, BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.
POD1000000042_S0000645	IT'S GOING TO BE, YEAH, FOR AT LEAST...
POD1000000042_S0000646	AT LEAST FOUR YEARS.
POD1000000042_S0000648	NO, REPUBLICANS ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO FLIP THE HOUSE IN 2022 BECAUSE LET'S JUST BE REAL HONEST ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. EVEN IF ANYTHING BIDEN WAS GOING TO PUSH WOULD HAVE MADE SOME POSITIVE DENT.
POD1000000042_S0000649	HE MAY RIDE THE WAVE FROM POST COVID AND IT'LL INFLATE THE WAY HIS NUMBERS LOOK THE SAME WAY THAT TRUMP'S LOOKED AFTER OBAMA'S POLICIES BROUGHT US OUT OF A RECESSION. LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THAT.
POD1000000042_S0000650	SUSTAINING IT IS IMPORTANT, RIGHT? BIDEN PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW THESE POLICIES WORK, BUT IN 2022, HE'LL BE RIDING THAT DOWNWARD WAVE AND REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE THE HOUSE AND
POD1000000042_S0000651	WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I MEAN, JOE BIDEN IS A STATESMAN. HE'S A WEIRD GUY, SNIFFS PEOPLE, VERY BIZARRE.
POD1000000042_S0000653	HE'S EXISTED IN DC, WHICH IS A FUCKING HORNET'S NEST FOR 50 YEARS, WHICH IS IN ITSELF IMPRESSIVE. I THINK IT'S WRONG THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE TO SERVE THAT LONG, BUT IT'S IMPRESSIVE TO BE ABLE TO STAY, KEEP YOUR HEAD ABOVE WATER FOR THAT AMOUNT OF TIME.
POD1000000042_S0000654	SO HE'S GOING TO ADJUST, I THINK. THE PROBLEM IS NOT HIM. THE PROBLEM IS KAMALA HARRIS.
POD1000000042_S0000655	WELL, I GOT YOU AND LOOK AND ALL I CAN LOOK HERE'S HERE'S OUR BEST IN MY OPINION BEST CASE SCENARIO IF BIDEN WINS IS IT BIDEN LIVES ANOTHER FOUR YEARS?
POD1000000042_S0000656	CAN STATE LIKE WE DON'T WANT HIM. WE DON'T WANT KAMALA HARRIS GOING BEING ABLE TO TAKE OVER
POD1000000042_S0000657	I MEAN, SHE WON'T, WHAT WOULD EVEN HAPPEN? THE SENATE, DOESN'T THE SENATE HAVE TO CONFIRM A NEW VP? SO THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A VP FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS IF IT HAPPENED. I MEAN.
POD1000000042_S0000658	BUT WHAT I HOPE IS, IS I HOPE IF ANYTHING, IF ANYTHING, THIS NEXT FOUR YEARS, LIKE OBVIOUSLY THEY PROBABLY WON'T PASS MUCH, THEY PROBABLY WON'T CHANGE MUCH. I THINK WE KNOW THAT. BUT MAN, MY HOPE FOR THIS COUNTRY IS, IS THAT IF HE DOES ANYTHING,
POD1000000042_S0000659	THAT HE CAN AT LEAST LET AMERICA CALM DOWN LIKE AND SO LIKE WE ARE SO EMOTIONALLY CHARGED RIGHT NOW AND LOOK AND I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PUT A LOT OF THAT ON DONALD TRUMP LIKE HE IS EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTED US AS A NATION
POD1000000042_S0000660	THAT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE A FIGHT. AND I GOT IT'S BOTH SIDES.
POD1000000042_S0000661	I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL HIM TO BLAME.
POD1000000042_S0000662	I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL HAND OF MINE.
POD1000000042_S0000663	CHALLENGED THE ESTABLISHMENT SO MUCH THEY CAME OUT AND SAID EVERYTHING HE DOES IS RACIST OR SEXIST OR WHATEVER THE FUCK.
POD1000000042_S0000664	I GOT YOU, BUT I THINK HE COULD HAVE HANDLED IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
POD1000000042_S0000665	YEAH, BUT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE. HE'S DONALD TRUMP, RIGHT? SO THERE'S NO HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT IN HIS TOOLBOX.
POD1000000042_S0000666	SO THAT'S MY HOPE IS THAT BIDEN WILL AT LEAST TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH OF NOT CHARGING, OF DOING SOME OF THIS DIRTY FIGHTING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.
POD1000000042_S0000667	THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN BET ON RIGHT? YEAH, CUZ HIS STATEMENTS ARE GONNA BE VERY LIMITED AND VERY SHORTENED ANYWAYS AND SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE RUNNING THE TWITTER FEED

POD1000000042_S0000669	HMM.
POD1000000042_S0000670	IT'S TENSION EVERYWHERE, RIGHT? EVERYBODY'S WALKING ON EGGSHELLS AND THIS AND THAT. HOPEFULLY, THEY CAN ACT AS ADULTS.
POD1000000042_S0000671	IT DOES PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE ON YOU, PARTICULARLY AS A MAN, I THINK.
POD1000000042_S0000672	YES.
POD1000000042_S0000673	BUT MAYBE EVEN STILL AS A WOMAN IN CONGRESS OR THE SENATE.
POD1000000042_S0000674	SENATE TO RESPOND AGGRESSIVELY IF YOU'RE SPOKEN TO AGGRESSIVELY BECAUSE IT APPEARS WEAK.
POD1000000042_S0000675	I MEAN, IMAGINE A COP WALKING UP AND SAYING, HEY, MOTHERFUCKER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND BE LIKE, OH, WELL, SIR.
POD1000000042_S0000676	YEAH, I'D BE LIKE I'M MINDING MY GODDAMN BUSINESS.

POD1000000042_S0000682	WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
POD1000000042_S0000683	WHICH IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP GAVE ALL THE MONEY TO AND SAYS, HEY MAN, WE HAVE IT. WE'VE GOT THE CURE AND WE'RE 90% RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ABOUT 50 MILLION OF THESE GUYS OUT INTO THE WORLD IN JANUARY.
POD1000000042_S0000684	TO ME BECAUSE DAN RAILS ON THIS ALL THE TIME THAT BIG PHARMA IS ALWAYS IN BED WITH DEMOCRATS THIS WAS A BIG FAT FUCK YOU FROM BIG PHARMA TO DONALD TRUMP SAYING
POD1000000042_S0000685	WELL, HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT'S TAKEN HIM TO COURT TRYING TO GET DRUG PRICES LOWERED. HE'S THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO HAVE THESE OTHER BARGAINING SCHEDULES THAT YOU CAN BUY DRUGS FROM AND STUFF LIKE THAT. HE'S DEFINITELY TAKEN THEM ON AND THEY MADE HIM PAY FOR IT.
POD1000000042_S0000686	AND HE TOOK ON BIG TECH AND THEY MADE HIM PAY FOR THAT TOO.
POD1000000042_S0000687	YEAH.
POD1000000042_S0000688	LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS. THE REASON DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T GET REELECTED ISN'T BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE TALKS. RIGHT? BECAUSE
POD1000000042_S0000689	TOOK EVERYBODY TO TASK.
POD1000000042_S0000690	BECAUSE WHEN WE COME ON THIS SHOW AND TALK THE WAY WE TALK, WE GET MORE VIEWERS. THE MORE AUTHENTIC WE ARE, THE MORE VIEWERS WE GET. AND HE IS, THERE'S NO MORE AUTHENTIC AMERICAN THAN DONALD TRUMP. LET'S BE REAL FOR BETTER OR WORSE.
POD1000000042_S0000691	YEAH, I KNOW.
POD1000000042_S0000692	BACK FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS.
POD1000000042_S0000693	HE NEVER HELD BACK.
POD1000000042_S0000694	LIKE A FUCKING, A DUDE FROM NEW YORK THAT'S GOT A FUCKING ATTITUDE ABOUT HIM, BUT HE'S ALSO BEEN SUCCESSFUL. OF COURSE HE'S GONNA GET AN EVEN BIGGER ATTITUDE. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, NOW HE'S IN HIS 70S AND HE'S A BILLIONAIRE. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA ACT, RIGHT? IT MADE PERFECT SENSE, HOWEVER.
POD1000000042_S0000695	THAT ALL THAT STUFF HIS PERSONNEL I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S COARSE WHEN HE SPEAKS. I THINK IT'S A COORDINATED EFFORT FROM ALL THESE VERY.
POD1000000042_S0000696	LOOK, IF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN TRYING TO BUTTFUCK YOU FOR YEARS AND IS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO SINCE 83% OF ALL PRIVATELY FILED BANKRUPTCIES ARE FILED BECAUSE OF UNPAID MEDICAL EXPENSES,
POD1000000042_S0000697	AND TECH COMPANIES WHO WE KNOW HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO EXPLOIT OUR DATA AND SELL THAT INFORMATION OFF TO PEOPLE, DO YOU THINK EITHER ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE WORKING FOR YOUR BEST INTEREST RIGHT NOW? THERE'S NO FUCKING WAY, RIGHT?
POD1000000042_S0000698	SO THAT'S WHY IT ALWAYS BRINGS ME BACK TO THIS SAME CONCLUSION. I'M NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER. HOWEVER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER FOR THE COUNTRY HAD HE BEEN REELECTED.
POD1000000042_S0000699	AND FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS.
POD1000000042_S0000700	AND I THINK IT WAS ONE HOUR. LET ME JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS.

POD1000000043_S0000023	OH YEAH.
POD1000000043_S0000024	YEAH, WE'RE TALKING TO A PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA LATER TODAY ABOUT HIS MEMOIR, BUT SPECIFICALLY
POD1000000043_S0000026	AND I ARE GONNA FOCUS ON ALL.
POD1000000043_S0000027	THE FOREIGN POLICY PARTS OF THE BOOK, HIS RECORD. SO WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET, SO I CAN'T TELL YOU IF IT'S ANY GOOD OR NOT. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO LIE TO YOU PEOPLE, BUT CHECK IT OUT. IT'LL BE OUT ON WEDNESDAY, NORMAL TIME.

POD1000000043_S0000032	ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO THE NEWS. LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER THE FIRST DOCUMENTED CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION JUST AUTHORIZED PFIZER'S COVID 19 VACCINE FOR EMERGENCY USE
POD1000000043_S0000033	AND THE INITIAL INJECTIONS HAVE BEGUN TODAY, MARKING THE LAUNCH OF THE LARGEST VACCINATION EFFORT IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
POD1000000043_S0000034	THE DOSES WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BASED ON EACH STATE'S ADULT POPULATION, AND THE STATES THEMSELVES WOULD DECIDE WHO GETS VACCINATED FIRST, WITH FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS EXPECTED TO BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE.
POD1000000043_S0000035	THE FIRST SHIPMENT OF 3 MILLION DOSES, ENOUGH TO INOCULATE 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE, WERE FLOWN OUT OF GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN ON SUNDAY AFTER BEING TRANSPORTED FROM ONE OF PFIZER'S NEARBY FACILITIES.
POD1000000043_S0000036	AND HERE'S A CLIP OF THE CROWD THAT GATHERED TO WATCH THE VACCINE LEAVE THE WAREHOUSE.
POD1000000043_S0000038	IT'S JUST NICE TO SEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE CHEERING SCIENCE AND NOT TRYING TO BURN SCIENTISTS AT THE STAKE.
POD1000000043_S0000040	THAT CLIP WASN'T ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR LISTENERS. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY CROWD, BUT IT'S NOT OFTEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT GOOD NEWS HERE, ESPECIALLY IN 2020 ON POD SAVE AMERICA.
POD1000000043_S0000041	SO THOUGHT WE'D PLAY THAT CLIP. LOVE IT. YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE SCOPE AND SPEED OF THIS SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT AND HOW IT CAME TO BE?
POD1000000043_S0000043	YEAH, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A I ACTUALLY REALLY, REALLY RECOMMEND THERE WAS A DEEP, DEEP DIVE IN THE WASHINGTON POST.
POD1000000043_S0000044	AND THAT WAS, I THINK, PRETTY FAIR IN LOOKING AT THE ACHIEVEMENT, OPERATION WARP SPEED, TRUMP'S IMPACT, HIS NEGATIVE IMPACT.
POD1000000043_S0000046	INSIDE OF THAT PIECE AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST MAKE IT ABOUT TRUMP BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW INSIDE OF THAT PIECE WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000048	THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE, REALLY IS. AND IT'S BORN OF AN INCREDIBLE FOCUS OVER THE LAST YEAR. IT'S BORN OF DECADES OF INVESTMENT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND BASIC RESEARCH IN
POD1000000043_S0000049	IN SYSTEMS THAT TRY TO PREVENT THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICS, OF CORPORATE INFLUENCE AND INTERFERENCE ON SCIENCE, THE BUILDING OF PUBLIC HEALTH, INFRASTRUCTURE OF TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS, LIKE ALL OF THAT.
POD1000000043_S0000050	BUT THEN THERE'S THIS
POD1000000043_S0000052	ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL IN THE PIECE. AND THEY'RE QUOTED AS SAYING SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, IN 20 YEARS, PEOPLE WON'T REMEMBER BLEACH. THEY WON'T REMEMBER HIM NOT WEARING MASKS. THEY WON'T REMEMBER THIS. THEY'LL JUST REMEMBER OPERATION WARP SPEED.
POD1000000043_S0000053	AND I SAW THAT AND I WAS LIKE, OH, OH, OKAY. I, SO, YOU KNOW, WISHING IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND WHAT WAS STRIKING TO ME IN SEEING THE TRUCKS
POD1000000043_S0000055	IT WAS BITTERSWEET TO ME. I WAS WATCHING THE VIDEOS ON REPEAT.
POD1000000043_S0000056	BECAUSE WHAT ELSE AM I GOING TO DO? AND WHAT I WAS THINKING WHEN I SAW IT IS.
POD1000000043_S0000058	LOOK AT THIS INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT THAT LIKE THESE SCIENTISTS AND GOVERNMENT WERE ABLE TO DO TOGETHER. IT TOOK EVERYTHING THAT TRUMP HATES. IT TOOK DISCIPLINE. IT TOOK BELIEF IN INSTITUTIONS. IT TOOK NOT ALLOWING POLITICAL INTERFERENCE. IT TOOK PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT.
POD1000000043_S0000060	MATH, SCIENCE.
POD1000000043_S0000061	AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS, HUMAN INGENUITY, HUMAN CREATIVITY, HUMAN DISCIPLINE, IT WAS ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE VIRUS, AND THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO OVERCOME TRUMP. IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP.
POD1000000043_S0000062	THE FAILURE TO GIVE PEOPLE RESOURCES TO SURVIVE, THE FAILURE TO HAVE ENOUGH MASKS, THE FAILURE TO MODEL BEST PRACTICES, THE FAILURE TO MODEL GOOD BEHAVIOR, THE FAILURE TO CELEBRATE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING, THE FAILURE TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
POD1000000043_S0000063	BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON THAT THIS VACCINE WOULD COME AT A TIME IN WHICH THE VIRUS WAS COMPLETELY UNCHECKED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT IS TRUMP'S GREAT FAILURE.
POD1000000043_S0000064	AND IT IS A TRIBUTE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO WAS INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS VACCINE HAPPEN, THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP.
POD1000000043_S0000065	THAT HAS BEEN BASICALLY THE ONLY CONSISTENT THING TRUMP HAS OFFERED UP AND UNTIL HIM PRETENDING TO BE A LEADER BY BADGERING OFFICIALS TO MAKE THE VACCINE ROLL OUT FASTER JUST BEFORE IT IS APPROVED
POD1000000043_S0000066	SO THAT HE COULD CLAIM SOME CREDIT AND GET HIMSELF IN THE NEWS CYCLE. IT ENDS AS IT BEGAN.
POD1000000043_S0000067	TELL ME WHAT DO YOU THINK? DO YOU THINK WE'LL STILL REMEMBER THE BLEACH IN 20 YEARS?
POD1000000043_S0000069	THE IDEA THAT ANY OF THESE PEOPLE CAN PREDICT WHAT WE WILL OR WON'T REMEMBER IN 20. I FEEL LIKE IN 20 YEARS, OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE, SO WAIT, YOU GUYS COULD HAVE PUT KLEENEX ON YOUR FACE AND NOT HAD 300000 PEOPLE DIED AND YOU CHOSE NOT TO. WHAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? LIKE, YOU KNOW, SO ANYWAY.
POD1000000043_S0000070	THAT IDIOT IS AN IDIOT. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I JUST FEEL LIKE IT HAS BEEN LIKE REALLY NICE FOR ALL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH TO WAKE UP AND READ THESE STORIES AND SEE THESE PHOTOS, RIGHT? I MEAN, HANNAH AND I CANCELED OUR PLANS TO SEE HER FAMILY AROUND THANKSGIVING.
POD1000000043_S0000071	WE'RE STAYING IN LA OVER CHRISTMAS INSTEAD OF GOING TO SEE MY MOM AND MY SISTER AND MY BROTHER IN BOSTON. AND IT SUCKS, RIGHT? I MEAN, HOLIDAYS ARE A BIG DEAL TO US. THEY ARE TO EVERYBODY. BUT, YOU KNOW, FINALLY, THERE'S THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL HERE.
POD1000000043_S0000072	AND TO LEVITT'S POINT, I MEAN, THIS VACCINE IS A MIRACLE. 95% EFFECTIVE AND CREATED IN RECORD TIME. I MEAN, WE ARE SO, SO LUCKY. THAT IS SO MUCH FASTER THAN ANYTHING IN HISTORY.
POD1000000043_S0000073	IT IS WAY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOUR STANDARD FLU VACCINE. SO THIS IS A MIRACLE. AND WE SHOULD BE CLEAR, THE PFIZER VACCINE WAS DEVELOPED BY A GERMAN COUPLE.
POD1000000043_S0000074	RIGHT. ONE OF THEM WAS BORN IN TURKEY AND EMIGRATED TO GERMANY WHEN HE WAS FOUR. THE OTHER IS THE DAUGHTER OF TURKISH IMMIGRANTS TO GERMANY. SO FOR ALL OF TRUMP'S CREDIT GRAB, WE HAVE GERMANS AND IMMIGRANTS TO THANK FOR THIS PFIZER VACCINE.
POD1000000043_S0000075	THE OPERATION WARP SPEED FOLKS DESERVE SOME CREDIT FOR BUYING 100 MILLION DOSES OF THE PFIZER VACCINE. THEY DESERVE OUR ETERNAL HATRED AND SHAME FOR PASSING ON UP TO 400 MILLION DOSES AT NO COST TO THE US. I MEAN, WE COULD HAVE JUST LIKE PAID WHEN WE GOT IT, RIGHT?
POD1000000043_S0000076	BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY SCIENTIFIC FEAT. THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING RESEARCH ABOUT HOW IN THE FUTURE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEED UP THIS PROCESS EVEN MORE. AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PRE PREPARE VACCINES FOR ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR KNOWN VIRUSES OUT THERE.
POD1000000043_S0000077	WE COULD MAYBE CREATE A VACCINE FOR 50 TO 100 OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PROMINENT VIRUSES FOR THE COST OF THE F 35 FIGHTER JET PROGRAM. SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD DEAL COMPARED TO A PLANE WE MAY OR MAY NOT NEED TO USE.
POD1000000043_S0000078	SO LOTS OF GOOD NEWS TODAY, FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS. AND IT WAS NICE TO SEE PEOPLE FEELING LESS SCARED, BASICALLY.
POD1000000043_S0000079	SO I JUST REMEMBER IN APRIL WHEN THIS STARTED, DR. FAUCI SAID 12 TO 18 MONTHS FOR A VACCINE, HOPEFULLY.
POD1000000043_S0000080	AND THERE WERE A BUNCH OF EPIDEMIOLOGISTS, SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS SAYING THAT FAUCI'S TIMELINE WAS WAY TOO OPTIMISTIC FOR 12 TO 18 MONTHS. 11 MONTHS. THAT'S WHAT THIS VACCINE CAME IN, 11 MONTHS.
POD1000000043_S0000081	THE SHORTEST TIMELINE PREVIOUSLY FOR ANY VACCINE EVER WAS THE MUMPS VACCINE, WHICH TOOK FOUR YEARS. THAT WAS THE RECORD. AND WE'VE GONE FROM FOUR YEARS TO 11 MONTHS. AND LIKE, YOU KNOW, TOMMY, YOU JUST MENTIONED ABOUT THE 95% EFFECTIVE.
POD1000000043_S0000082	FDA WAS READY TO APPROVE A VACCINE THAT WAS OVER 50% EFFECTIVE. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT EXPECTED 95% EFFECTIVE, I MEAN, IT TRULY IS A MIRACLE.
POD1000000043_S0000083	THERE WERE HEADLINES BACK IN THE SPRING SAYING LIKE WE MAY NEVER GET A VACCINE. SO NO, I HAD THE SAME KIND OF HOPE AND OPTIMISM.
POD1000000043_S0000084	THIS SECTION IS JOHN BASICALLY BEING SO MAD AT LIKE A SERIES OF ARTICLES IN THE ATLANTIC THAT WERE SO ANNOYING OVER THE COURSE OF MANY MONTHS. IT WAS LIKE THE DOOM AND GLOOM PUBLICATION OF CHOICE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.
POD1000000043_S0000085	I'VE BEEN HOLDING BACK ON THIS.
POD1000000043_S0000087	THE ATLANTIC HAS SOME OF LIKE THE BEST JOURNALISTS IN THE WORLD AND WRITES SOME OF THE BEST FUCKING STUFF IN THE WORLD. BUT THE NUMBER OF DOOMSDAY, YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE THEM, THE NUMBER OF DOOMSDAY HEADLINES IN THAT FUCKING PUBLICATION ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO LIVE FOREVER WITH THIS AND NEVER GO BE THE SAME IS RIDICULOUS.
POD1000000043_S0000088	BUT ANYWAY.
POD1000000043_S0000090	NO, SO I WAS VERY HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC TOO, AND KIND OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING,
POD1000000043_S0000092	LIKE IT.
POD1000000043_S0000093	IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT OUR WORLD IS POLITICS AND WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT POLITICS AND WE'RE OBSESSED WITH POLITICS AND POLITICS IS REALLY BROKEN AND THE BROKENNESS OF POLITICS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATH AND DISASTER THAT HAS COME FROM THIS PANDEMIC.
POD1000000043_S0000094	BUT OTHER PARTS OF SOCIETY ARE NOT BROKEN. SCIENCE IS NOT BROKEN. LIKE THIS WAS A FEAT OF SCIENCE AND JUST LIKE A MODERN MIRACLE THAT THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.
POD1000000043_S0000095	EVEN THOUGH POLITICS FAILED US.
POD1000000043_S0000097	EVERY OTHER WAY, EVERY OTHER WAY.
POD1000000043_S0000098	WELL, I ALSO I ALSO JUST SAY TO THAT, LIKE FOUSHEE SAID, BASICALLY THAT HE WAS GOING TO SEE THIS VACCINE TO THE END.
POD1000000043_S0000099	AND
POD1000000043_S0000100	A
POD1000000043_S0000101	DESPITE THE THE HEADWINDS THAT WERE PRESENTED BY HIS BOSS, DESPITE THE INCREDIBLE OBSTACLES SET UP BY DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CAME TO AN END AND LIKE HE'S A REAL, YOU KNOW, HE'S A HERO.
POD1000000043_S0000103	YES. SO TRUMP DID PUBLICLY PRESSURE THE FDA TO SPEED UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS FROM SATURDAY TO FRIDAY, AND HIS CHIEF OF STAFF REPORTEDLY THREATENED TO FIRE FDA COMMISSIONER STEPHEN HAHN IF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. YOU GUYS SEE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT?
POD1000000043_S0000104	I MEAN, YEAH, LOOK, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF CREDIT FOR A MINUTE, BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A DEBATE GOING ON, TOO. BUT LIKE,
POD1000000043_S0000105	WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PFIZER VACCINE, THE US DESERVES CREDIT FOR MAKING AN ADVANCE PURCHASE OF THAT VACCINE IN JULY. THEY GOT 100 MILLION DOSES.
POD1000000043_S0000106	WELL, I ALREADY MENTIONED HOW ANGRY I AM THAT THEY DIDN'T ADVANCE PURCHASE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION MORE DOSES, BUT WHATEVER.
POD1000000043_S0000107	BUT THE THING THAT'S INCREDIBLE AGAIN ABOUT THE MODERNA VACCINE IS THAT THAT VACCINE WAS DESIGNED JANUARY 13TH, 2020. WE'VE HAD THIS VACCINE FORMULA IN OUR HANDS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.
POD1000000043_S0000108	BECAUSE A VERY BRAVE CHINESE DOCTOR SEQUENCED THE GENOME AND PUBLICIZED IT AND THESE ADVANCES IN MRNA TECHNOLOGY THAT NONE OF US ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND, BUT IT ALLOWED US TO PULL THIS OFF SO QUICKLY. AND NOW THE PROBLEM BECOMES LOGISTICS.
POD1000000043_S0000109	BUT I MEAN, IN TERMS OF LIKE THREATENING THE FDA CHIEF, I MEAN, THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THAT. I MEAN, EVEN THE TERM OPERATION WARP SPEED IS HORRIBLY PROBLEMATIC IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW.
POD1000000043_S0000110	LIKE WE KNOW TRUMP WANTS CREDIT FOR THE VACCINE BEING DEVELOPED QUICKLY, BUT THIS ISN'T FAST FOOD. LIKE NO ONE IS REALLY PUMPED ABOUT LIKE A RUSHED MEDICAL PRODUCT, RIGHT? LIKE NO ONE'S GETTING THE FASTEST CREATED TYLENOL EVER.
POD1000000043_S0000112	IT'S A BAD IDEA TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND TO TALK ABOUT IT AS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED QUICKLY OR IN A RUSHED MANNER. AND SO GOING EVEN FURTHER TO POLITICIZE THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS A BAD IDEA.
POD1000000043_S0000113	WHEN YOU'VE GOT LIKE, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME SUBSETS OF THE ANTI VAXXER COMMUNITY THAT ARE KIND OF SUPER AGGRESSIVE AND DANGEROUS AND SPREAD MISINFORMATION.
POD1000000043_S0000114	BUT THEN THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, WHO HAVE READ ABOUT THE TUSKEGEE SYPHILIS STUDY AND HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDABLE HESITATION BASED ON THAT HISTORY ABOUT A NEW DRUG.
POD1000000043_S0000115	SO THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A SERIOUS SCIENCE BASED PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DESPERATELY WANT A VACCINE BUT CAN'T HAVE IT.
POD1000000043_S0000116	RIGHT? LIKE IF YOU'RE GETTING CHEMOTHERAPY, YOU CAN'T GET THE VACCINE. IF YOU'RE UNDER 16 AS OF RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T TAKE THE VACCINE. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE APPROVED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN.
POD1000000043_S0000117	AND SO IF THE VIRUS IS SWIRLING AROUND THE COUNTRY BECAUSE A BUNCH OF VACCINE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE JUST REFUSE TO TAKE IT, THAT'LL PUT OTHERS AT RISK.
POD1000000043_S0000118	AND SO THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST IT'S HORRIBLE THAT WE HAVE TO READ THESE STORIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN OF TRUMP POLITICIZING THE PROCESS WHEN IF HE HAD JUST SHUT UP AND STEPPED BACK AND LET THE PROCESS WORK, THINGS WOULD BE BETTER.
POD1000000043_S0000119	IN FACT, PFIZER DIDN'T TAKE OPERATION WARP SPEED MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT SLOW THEM DOWN.
POD1000000043_S0000121	YEAH, I MEAN, LIKE TRUMP IS THE WORST OFFENDER HERE, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO GET THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AROUND THIS CORRECT, YOU KNOW, EVEN FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WHO'S GOING TO APPROACH IT IN GOOD FAITH, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000043_S0000122	EVEN THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS, IT WASN'T A UNANIMOUS DECISION AND SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE, WHY DID SOME MEMBERS OF THE PANEL VOTE AGAINST IT? WELL, IT TURNS OUT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED AGAINST IT WERE JUST SAYING, OH, I DON'T THINK IT'S READY FOR 16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS.
POD1000000043_S0000124	TWO SPECIFIC AGES. BUT IT'S LIKE THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU COMMUNICATE CLEARLY TO PEOPLE. BECAUSE IF YOU JUST SEE A NUMBER, OH, SOME PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST IT, YOU THINK IT'S DANGEROUS. IT'S NOT. IT'S JUST THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE AGES SO FAR, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000043_S0000125	SO THERE IS GOING TO BE LIKE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AROUND THIS VACCINATION EFFORT. AND IT REALLY HAS TO BE CONSISTENT AND DONE VERY WELL.
POD1000000043_S0000126	WELL, I MEAN, LOOK, THERE WAS SOMETHING SUCH A TO ME WAS SUCH LIKE A SIGNAL EXAMPLE OF WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD, BECAUSE, YEAH, HE WAS COMPLAINING THAT, OH, THEY HELD BACK THE SAYING THAT THE VACCINE WORKED.
POD1000000043_S0000127	BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HELP ME IN MY ELECTION, RIGHT? THAT WAS JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. BUT THIS WAS LIKE,
POD1000000043_S0000129	HE KNEW THE APPROVAL WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. HE WASN'T GOING TO SPEED IT UP. HE WASN'T REALLY GOING TO SLOW IT DOWN. THE VACCINE WAS GOING TO BE DELIVERED ON MONDAY.
POD1000000043_S0000130	SO WE LIKE HECTOR AND HECTOR AND HECTOR TO ACHIEVE SOME MADE UP RESULTS SO THAT HE COULD LOOK LIKE A TV PRESIDENT.
POD1000000043_S0000132	THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS TOO IS THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENED THAT HASN'T HAPPENED, RIGHT? LIKE
POD1000000043_S0000133	THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T EXIST ABOUT HOW THE VACCINE IS GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED, WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO. LIKE THERE'S ALL THE ASPECTS OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP THAT HAVE JUST BEEN COMPLETELY MISSING, RIGHT?
POD1000000043_S0000134	LIKE IT'S WHY THERE AREN'T ENOUGH N95 MASKS RIGHT NOW. IT'S WHY THERE MAY BE SUPPLY PROBLEMS DOWN THE LINE WITH THE VACCINE. AND IT'S WHY RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE WILL GET IT.
POD1000000043_S0000135	WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GONNA GO, WE DON'T KNOW THE PROCESS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO PUBLIC EDUCATION AND SOME OF THIS HASN'T EVEN BEEN FULLY THOUGHT OUT.
POD1000000043_S0000137	POTS OF AMERICA IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY HELIX. SOME IDEAS FOR JOKES, ADD INTROS. NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP BECAUSE OF TODAY'S POLITICS, PANDEMICS, YOUR LOVE LIFE, ANY OTHER DRAMA YOU TALK ABOUT IN YOUR SHOW. WHAT OTHER DRAMA DO WE TALK ABOUT?

POD1000000043_S0000198	TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THEY HOPE TO VACCINATE UP TO 24 MILLION AMERICANS BY MID JANUARY. AND JOE BIDEN HAS SET A GOAL OF 100 MILLION VACCINATIONS WITHIN HIS FIRST 100 DAYS, WHICH WOULD BRING US TO THE END OF APRIL.
POD1000000043_S0000199	WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BIGGER CHALLENGES IN GETTING EVERY AMERICAN INOCULATED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE? YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALREADY COVERED SORT OF THE DEMAND SIDE OF IT, WHICH IS MAKING SURE THAT ENOUGH PEOPLE WANT IT AND TRUST IT. BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER OTHER ISSUES INVOLVED IN THIS, TOMMY?
POD1000000043_S0000200	I MEAN, I THINK IT'S THIS IS NOW JUST A MASSIVE LOGISTICAL ISSUE. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT 100 MILLION, 200 MILLION, 500 MILLION DOSES, IF EVERYBODY NEEDS TWO OF THEM, ALL OF THOSE DOSES NEED TO BE CONTAINED IN A LITTLE VIAL.
POD1000000043_S0000201	AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE MANUFACTURED AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE SHIPPED SOMEWHERE AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE DOLED OUT BY STATES THAT ARE REALLY SHORT ON CASH. AND SO IT REALLY IS LIKE, THANK GOD JOE BIDEN AND HIS TEAM ARE COMING IN BECAUSE IT REALLY IS JUST ABOUT COMPETENCY.
POD1000000043_S0000202	AND SO THAT'S WHERE, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I FEEL A LITTLE MORE HOPEFUL. I MEAN, I FEEL HOPEFUL IN A LOT OF WAYS WITH JOE BIDEN AND NOT TRUMP, BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL FEEL HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT MAYBE WE CAN SPEED UP THESE TIMELINES.
POD1000000043_S0000203	I GUESS THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND LOOK, I'M TOTALLY OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE, IS WHY THE US GOVERNMENT ISN'T USING THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO MAYBE AID IN MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE.
POD1000000043_S0000204	I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD DO WHAT TRUMP SEEMS TO BE ATTEMPTING TO DO WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH IS USE THE DPA OR USE THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY, HEY, PFIZER, ALL YOUR DOSES ARE FOR US. THEY'RE NOT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. THAT'S IMMORAL.
POD1000000043_S0000205	AND IT'S NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE THEY MANUFACTURE A LOT OF THESE DOSES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, TOO. BUT LIKE AT A MINIMUM, WE COULD USE THE DPA TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION OF PPE.
POD1000000043_S0000206	OR WE COULD USE MILITARY ASSETS TO SHIP SOME OF THESE VACCINES, ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE STORED AT SUPER COLD TEMPERATURES. WE COULD RAMP UP THE AVAILABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF TESTING.
POD1000000043_S0000207	TO DO A BETTER JOB OF IDENTIFYING OUTBREAKS. I MEAN, I DO THINK LIKE THE THING WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WAS THE BROKEN MESSAGING AND CLARITY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHAT'S GOING TO EXPECT. AND THE BIDEN TEAM WILL FIX THAT.
POD1000000043_S0000208	ALONG THOSE LINES, I MEAN, I THINK ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE MEDIA COULD DO IS COMMIT TO NOT REPORTING ON OR AMPLIFYING TRUMP'S COVID RELATED LIES OR MISINFORMATION.
POD1000000043_S0000209	STARTING THE DAY HE LEAVES OFFICE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HE IS LIKE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN TERMS OF VACCINE HESITATION RIGHT NOW. AND WE SHOULD ALL AGREE THAT WE ARE MOVING ON FROM THIS ASSHOLE IF YOU'RE NOT A FOX NEWS HOST.
POD1000000043_S0000210	I SORT OF GET THE SENSE THAT THE DPA IS LIKE, AND IT'S TOUGH TO FIGURE THIS OUT NOW BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HERE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO DO, BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LAST RESORT THING THAT YOU USE.
POD1000000043_S0000211	IF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PRIVATE COMPANIES AREN'T COOPERATING AND DOING WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO FAST ENOUGH. AND OF COURSE, IT'S LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE, RIGHT? SO THERE'S SUPPLY OF THE VACCINE.
POD1000000043_S0000212	BUT THERE'S GLASS VIALS, SYRINGES, NEEDLES, COOLING SYSTEMS, ULTRA COLD FREEZERS, GPS THERMAL SENSORS. I MEAN, IF YOU READ SOME OF THESE STORIES ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET THE VACCINE AROUND, IT'S INCREDIBLE. AND IT'S LIKE SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST NEEDING ENOUGH ACTUAL VACCINE.
POD1000000043_S0000213	SO THE COORDINATION AND LOGISTICS ARE JUST LIKE MIND BOGGLING. ALSO DELIVERING THEM, RIGHT? LIKE YOU NEED THE FIRST BATCH OF VACCINES ARE GOING TO HOSPITALS THAT CAN HANDLE ULTRA COLD STORAGE, WHICH IS NOT EVERY HOSPITAL.
POD1000000043_S0000214	TRUCKS THAT CAN HANDLE ULTRA COLD STORAGE, WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT EVERY TRUCK.
POD1000000043_S0000215	AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ISSUE WHERE IT'S LIKE GOING TO BE HARDER TO REACH RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS THAT JUST DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT HEALTH CARE CAPACITY. HOW DO YOU GET IT TO THEM WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TRUCKS AND HOSPITALS THERE? LIKE IT IS A IT'S A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS QUITE A CHALLENGE ON IT.
POD1000000043_S0000216	WE NEED THE MODERNA APPROVAL TO COME THROUGH BECAUSE THAT CAN BE STORED AT MORE REGULAR TEMPERATURES AND THAT WILL, I THINK, HELP.
POD1000000043_S0000217	FOR SURE.
POD1000000043_S0000218	AND I DO SORT OF WISH ASTRAZENECA HADN'T JUST TOLD DOCTORS TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, GIVE PEOPLE TWO OR THREE FINGERS WORTH. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
POD1000000043_S0000220	TWO FINGERS FOR MOST PEOPLE, THREE FINGERS IF YOU'RE LIKE, YOU'RE, YOU KNOW, REALLY THIRSTY FOR THE VACCINE.
POD1000000043_S0000222	BECAUSE NOT GREAT, NOT GREAT. AND I WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON. COME ON JOHNSON & JOHNSON.
POD1000000043_S0000223	TOMMY, YOU SAID THIS A COUPLE TIMES, BUT WE REALLY SHOULD HIT ON IT. THE FACT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE BOUGHT 400 MILLION MORE DOSES FROM PFIZER
POD1000000043_S0000224	HAVE THE CHANCE IN JULY. AND THEN I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL I SAW SCOTT GOTTLIEB, THE FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER, WAS ON CNBC THIS MORNING SAYING
POD1000000043_S0000225	AS LATE AS NOVEMBER. THIS NOVEMBER, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD ANOTHER CHANCE TO BUY ANOTHER 400 MILLION DOSES AND DIDN'T. AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY. I KEEP LOOKING FOR HIM.
POD1000000043_S0000226	ARE WE JUST, IS THIS HYPERBOLE? ARE WE LIKE NOT? NO, NO, THERE'S NO EXPLANATION ANYWHERE, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, OF WHY THEY PASSED UP IN NOVEMBER THE CHANCE TO BUY ANOTHER 400 MILLION DOSES.
POD1000000043_S0000227	I GET THAT THEY'RE HEDGING THEIR BETS AND BUYING FROM A BUNCH OF COMPANIES, BUT AGAIN,
POD1000000043_S0000228	RIGHT.
POD1000000043_S0000229	BUT IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WE HAD TO MAKE THE PAYMENT UPON RECEIPT OF THE DOSES. SO IF WE DIDN'T GET THEM FROM PFIZER, WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY. BUT IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, SPENDING ANOTHER $8 BILLION ON VACCINE DOSES IS NOTHING
POD1000000043_S0000230	NOTHING COMPARED TO THE COST IN LIVES, IN OUR ECONOMY AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IT IS BAFFLING. IT IS ABSOLUTELY MIND BOGGLING. IT IS BAFFLING. I DON'T GET HOW THIS HAPPENED. THIS IS A FUCK UP OF JUST EPIC PROPORTION.
POD1000000043_S0000231	AND I DON'T KNOW, HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHO DID IT. I BET THE EMAIL WAS JUST LIKE UNOPENED IN JARED'S INBOX SOMEWHERE WITH ONE OF HIS, YOU KNOW, HIS COLLEGE ROOMMATES, YOU KNOW, TOLD HIM NOT TO DO IT OR SOMETHING.
POD1000000043_S0000232	YEAH, I'VE BEEN LOOKING TOO. IT'S LIKE THERE'S REALLY IS YOU CAN'T FIND ANY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THE MONEY WAS NO RISK. THERE WAS NO RISK.
POD1000000043_S0000234	IF IT WORKED.
POD1000000043_S0000235	AND I WAS LIKE, WERE THEY WORRIED ABOUT GETTING THE SUPER COLD VERSION WHERE THEY WERE ALSO COUNTING ON MODERNA, ASTRAZENECA, JOHNSON & JOHNSON? IS THERE ANY EXPLANATION? SO FAR, THERE'S BEEN NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER.
POD1000000043_S0000236	NONE.
POD1000000043_S0000237	IT'S CRAZY.
POD1000000043_S0000238	AND OF COURSE, STATES DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT BECAUSE OF THIS RECESSION. AND THEY HAVE BEEN BEGGING FOR LOCAL AND STATE AID FOR MONTHS THAT MITCH MCCONNELL IS HOLDING UP SINGLE HANDEDLY. IN FACT, HE'S HOLDING UP THE ENTIRE COVID RELIEF BILL OVER THIS.
POD1000000043_S0000239	BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT STATES TO GET A PENNY OF ADDITIONAL MONEY. IT DOES SEEM TO ME LIKE DEMOCRATS SHOULD JUST HAMMER THIS ISSUE RELENTLESSLY AND TURN THE STATE AND LOCAL AID ISSUE INTO AN ISSUE ABOUT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION TO STATES.
POD1000000043_S0000240	YEAH, I MEAN JUST BEFORE WE WERE RECORDING IT LOOKED LIKE SOME OF THE NEGOTIATORS WERE PUTTING OUT KIND OF TWO VERSIONS, RIGHT? THEY WERE GONNA PUT OUT THE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WAS JUST THE RELIEF PORTION AND THEY WERE GONNA SEPARATE OUT
POD1000000043_S0000241	THE STATE AID AND THE LIABILITY PORTION.
POD1000000043_S0000242	BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO PASS AND THEY'RE LIKE, ALL RIGHT, WE'LL JUST FUCKING SET THAT LOOSE.
POD1000000043_S0000243	WELL, IT DOES SEEM LIKE IF WE IF WE REALLY ARE SEPARATING OUT LIABILITY AND STATE AND LOCAL AID, IT DOES SEEM TO DOOM LIABILITY PROTECTIONS AND STATE AND LOCAL AID BECAUSE MITCH MCCONNELL WON'T BUDGE ON STATE ON STATE AND LOCAL AID. DEMOCRATS OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT LIABILITY PROTECTIONS.
POD1000000043_S0000244	I DON'T CARE WHAT THAT NEGOTIATION LOOKS LIKE. IT'S A MADDENING THING. I TALKED TO SCHATZ ABOUT IT IN LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT, AND IT REALLY IS
POD1000000043_S0000245	AS IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING, THIS IS TAKING A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF PROTECTING PEOPLE AND HELPING PEOPLE DURING THIS CRISIS AND ADDING A COMPLETELY UNRELATED THING OF IMMUNIZING CORPORATIONS.
POD1000000043_S0000246	WHICH DOES NOTHING TO HELP US GET OUT OF THIS CRISIS. BUT IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH SEPARATING THOSE THINGS OUT MAKES BOTH FAR LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN WHILE MAKING DIRECT PAYMENTS MAYBE MORE PLAUSIBLE. I DON'T KNOW.
POD1000000043_S0000247	I JUST, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES ME THE MOST INSANE ABOUT WASHINGTON IS THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT WHEN IN TERMS OF PRESS COVERAGE RIGHT SO LIKE THE WORST YOU ARE AS A HUMAN BEING
POD1000000043_S0000248	THE MORE TERRIBLE YOU ARE CONSISTENTLY, THE LESS LIKELY YOU ARE TO GET HAMMERED OVER AN ISSUE LIKE THIS. AND WHEN IT COMES TO MITCH MCCONNELL, HE HAS SPENT MONTHS REFUSING TO ENGAGE WITH DEMOCRATS OVER COVID RELIEF PERIOD. AND NOW HE WANTS TO PUNISH STATES.
POD1000000043_S0000249	BECAUSE THEIR FINANCES HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY LOCKDOWNS THAT WERE MADE NECESSARY BY A FEDERAL RESPONSE THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE. AND AGAIN, LIKE LOVE MENTIONED, HIS TOP PRIORITY IS LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR BUSINESSES.
POD1000000043_S0000250	WHAT? LIKE MITCH MCCONNELL HAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR HOURS IN FOOD LINES BECAUSE OF MITCH MCCONNELL. RIGHT. LIKE STATES HAVE TO DECIDE WHO GETS THIS VACCINE FIRST. THEY HAVE TO DISTRIBUTE IT. THEY HAVE TO DO ALL THESE LOGISTICS AND HE'S PREVENTING THEM FROM GETTING THAT MONEY.
POD1000000043_S0000251	RIGHT NOW, MITCH MCCONNELL IS BLOCKING A BIPARTISAN BILL TO PREVENT PATIENTS WHO HAVE INSURANCE FROM GETTING SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS FOR UNEXPECTED OUT OF NETWORK OR EMERGENCY CARE. WHY?
POD1000000043_S0000252	BECAUSE HE CARES MORE ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY BACKED INSURANCE COMPANY PROFITS THAN REGULAR PEOPLE. MCCONNELL IS ONE OF THE WORST PEOPLE IN POLITICAL HISTORY. HE'S DISGUSTING, HE'S A CORPORATE STOOGE, HE'S CYNICAL,
POD1000000043_S0000253	AND LIKE THE COVERAGE OF HIM IN HOW HE ACTS IS TALKED ABOUT AS SORT OF SAVVY OR TOUGH AND IMPRESSIVE. THE REALITY IS HE'S A MONSTER. HE'S A MONSTER. HE'S A BAD LEGISLATOR. ALL HE DOES IS BLOCK SHIT. EVERYTHING THEY DO IS VIA SOME.
POD1000000043_S0000255	YOU GET PUNISHED FOR TRYING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S LIKE EVERYONE'S HAMMERING PELOSI ONLINE FOR ENGAGING OR NOT ENGAGING, FUCKING TWEETING OUT PICTURES OF THE AMOUNT OF ICE CREAM SHE HAS IN HER FREEZER. LIKE MITCH MCCONNELL IS THE CLEAR ENEMY HE HAS BEEN ALL ALONG.
POD1000000043_S0000257	BUT THIS IS THIS DRIVES ME NUTS. IT'S LIKE, AND YOU KNOW WHY MITCH MCCONNELL IS GOING TO GET HIS WAY ON THIS AND THIS DEAL IS PROBABLY GOING TO PASS WITH ALL OF THE SHIT THAT HE WANTS IN IT OR DOESN'T WANT IN IT IS BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE FUCKING NUMBERS AND HE'S GOT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LIKE I SAID, YOU KNOW.
POD1000000043_S0000258	BERNIE SANDERS SAID THE DEAL IS BAD AND WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT THE DEAL. AND I AGREE WITH HIM IN THE SENSE THAT THE DEAL IS FUCKING BAD. THE BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE IS BAD.
POD1000000043_S0000259	NOW THAT THEY'VE SEPARATED STATE AND LOCAL AID AND LIABILITY PROTECTIONS, WHAT'S LEFT OVER IS EVEN MORE INADEQUATE THAN THE BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE. IT'S SHIT FOR SURE. BUT LIKE,
POD1000000043_S0000260	WHAT'S THE CHOICE HERE? YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEGOTIATE A BETTER PACKAGE WITH THESE REPUBLICANS. WHO ARE YOU GONNA GET TO VOTE FOR MORE MONEY? YOU'RE GONNA GET SUSAN COLLINS AND MITT ROMNEY TO VOTE FOR MORE MONEY AND LISA MURKOWSKI? NO, THEY SAID THIS IS AS BEST THAT THEY WOULD DO.
POD1000000043_S0000261	AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE DEAL AND WE DON'T WIN GEORGIA, WE'RE NOT GONNA GET A BETTER DEAL WHEN JOE BIDEN'S PRESIDENT. AND JOE BIDEN'S NOT GONNA HAVE A MECHANISM TO FORCE A BETTER DEAL BECAUSE MITCH MCCONNELL'S GONNA SIT THERE AND SAY, FUCK YOU. I HAVE THE NUMBERS, I DON'T HAVE TO PASS A DEAL.
POD1000000043_S0000262	IF THEY REALLY DO PULL OUT STATE AND LOCAL AID AND THEY PULL OUT THE LIABILITY PROTECTIONS, WHICH OBVIOUSLY NONE OF US THINK SHOULD BE PART OF THIS AT ALL, MAKES NO SENSE. AND THEY HAVE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING THEY WON'T DO A TRILLION DOLLARS. I MEAN, KEEP IN MIND, DEMOCRATS, RIGHT, WE'VE COME DOWN FROM
POD1000000043_S0000264	TO $2 TRILLION TO $1.5 TRILLION. NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO $1 TRILLION. WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY REPLACE THE STATE AND LOCAL AID AS IT WAS DRAFTED WITH DIRECT PAYMENTS. DOES THAT BECOME SOMETHING THAT GETS PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE BACK ON BOARD?
POD1000000043_S0000265	I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE MAYBE YOU TRY THAT. I MEAN, BERNIE IS ONE THING, BUT LIKE LIKE JOSH HAWLEY OR SOME OF THESE REPUBLICANS WHO WANT DIRECT PAYMENTS. YEAH, I WOULD I WOULD TRY TO GET AS MUCH IN THERE AS I COULD, YOU KNOW, AND I WOULD TRY TO PUSH MORE DIRECT PAYMENTS FOR SURE. BUT LIKE AT THE END OF THE DAY.
POD1000000043_S0000266	I WOULD ALSO TAKE WHATEVER'S LEFT BECAUSE SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT MONEY.
POD1000000043_S0000267	I MEAN, LOOK, CONGRESS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WELL ANYMORE. WHAT THEY DO IS THEY JAM EVERY BILL THEY'RE EVER SUPPOSED TO PASS TOGETHER IN WHAT'S CALLED AN OMNIBUS. AND THE DEADLINE FOR THAT BILL, WHICH IS CURRENTLY, I THINK, 1.4 TRILLION WITH THE T DOLLARS IS FRIDAY.
POD1000000043_S0000268	OR ELSE THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO JAM WHATEVER LIKE COVID RELIEF MEASURES THEY CAN INTO THAT. AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THE BEST AND ONLY SHOT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE UNTIL FEBRUARY, MARCH, I DON'T KNOW.
POD1000000043_S0000270	I ALSO, WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS, YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. AND SO LIKE THIS.
POD1000000043_S0000272	IF THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING CLOSE TO A TRILLION DOLLAR RELIEF BILL, IT WILL BE INADEQUATE. IT WILL BE TERRIBLY INADEQUATE AND PEOPLE WILL BE SUFFERING NEXT YEAR.
POD1000000043_S0000273	AND IF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REPLACING STATE AND LOCAL AID WITH DIRECT PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE, YOU ARE KIND OF CHANGING WHERE THAT INADEQUACY AND WHERE THAT PAIN WILL BE FELT.
POD1000000043_S0000274	AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS NEXT YEAR YOU WANT STATES AND LOCALITIES TO BE PUT IN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT POSITIONS RIGHT AS HOPEFULLY WE'RE EMERGING FROM THIS TO CUT TRANSPORTATION, CUT SCHOOLS, CUT PUBLIC HEALTH,
POD1000000043_S0000275	CUT TO FUND THE POLICE, SOMETHING REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BELIEVE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY OPPOSE AND EVERY OTHER LOCAL SERVICE. SO IT REALLY IS LIKE.
POD1000000043_S0000276	BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETELY INADEQUATE STIMULUS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, WE ARE REALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT WHO DO WE WANT TO UNNECESSARILY SUBJECT TO PAIN.
POD1000000043_S0000278	YOU WANT AN ADEQUATE STIMULUS VOTE FOR TWO DEMOCRATS IN GEORGIA. THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET AN ADEQUATE.
POD1000000043_S0000280	OF THE PAST YEAR.
POD1000000043_S0000281	AS THE FOUNDERS INTENDED!
POD1000000043_S0000282	LITERALLY.
POD1000000043_S0000283	YOU GATHER AND HIDE.
POD1000000043_S0000285	WITH POLICE PROTECTION. YEAH, EXACTLY. SORRY. SORRY. SORRY. I'M I'M I'M TOO HOT TODAY.
POD1000000043_S0000286	IT IS A DAY THAT IT'S A DAY THAT USUALLY PASSES WITHOUT MUCH FANFARE, EXCEPT FOR THIS YEAR, WHEN DONALD TRUMP AND MOST REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS IN CONGRESS HAVE SO FAR REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
POD1000000043_S0000287	EVEN THOUGH THEIR FALSE CONSPIRACIES ABOUT VOTER FRAUD HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED BY ELECTION OFFICIALS AND JUDGES FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN.
POD1000000043_S0000288	THE LATEST AND LIKELY LAST LEGAL CHALLENGE TO INVALIDATE EVERY BALLOT CAST IN FOUR BATTLEGROUND STATES WAS REJECTED BY THE US SUPREME COURT. ONLY TWO JUSTICES, CLARENCE THOMAS AND SAMUEL ALITO, BELIEVE THE COURT WAS OBLIGATED TO HEAR SUCH A CASE.
POD1000000043_S0000289	BUT EVEN THEY REFUSED TO HEAR THIS PARTICULAR PILE OF STEAMING GARBAGE. THEY WERE LIKE, YEAH, BASICALLY THESE KIND OF CASES, I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN SHUT THEM DOWN. BUT THIS CASE, YEAH, NO, NO, DEFINITELY THIS CASE.
POD1000000043_S0000290	SO, ON ONE HAND, WE HAVE A COMPLETE REJECTION BY THE SUPREME COURT THAT COMES AFTER 59 OTHER REJECTIONS BY JUDGES APPOINTED BY DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING TRUMP.
POD1000000043_S0000291	ON THE OTHER, WE HAVE 17 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND 126 REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THAT IS MORE THAN HALF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS.
POD1000000043_S0000292	INCLUDING MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY, WHO WANTS TO BE FUCKING SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN TWO YEARS. ALL THESE PEOPLE PUBLICLY SUPPORTED AN ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION, PUBLICLY SUPPORTED AND LENT THEIR NAMES TO.
POD1000000043_S0000293	WHAT DO YOU GUYS TAKE AWAY FROM THAT? TOMMY?
POD1000000043_S0000294	I MEAN, I TAKE AWAY THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NO LONGER A PARTY. IT'S A CULT. AND THE CULT LEADER IS ABOUT TO BE OUT OF OFFICE, BUT HE IS STILL MIXING UP A BIG VAT OF KOOL AID AND HE HAS NOT LOOSENED HIS GRIP ON THESE PEOPLE AT ALL.
POD1000000043_S0000295	I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW IRRATIONAL THE DEMAND IS. IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THE DEMANDS ARE ILLEGAL. THE MAGA CULT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. THEY BELIEVE IN TRUMP.
POD1000000043_S0000296	AND I JUST, PEOPLE LOVE TO BOTH SIDES IT AND DECRY PARTISANSHIP, LIKE WE SHOULD JUST BE CLEAR THIS IS A VERY NEW THING. LIKE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS SUPPORTIVE OF OBAMA.
POD1000000043_S0000297	BUT IF HE HAD SAID FALSELY THAT THE BP OIL SPILL WAS FIXED WHEN EVERYONE WAS WATCHING OIL GUSHING OUT OF IT ON LIVE TV, ZERO DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LINE BEHIND HIM, RIGHT?
POD1000000043_S0000298	BUT LIKE TRUMP'S COVID DENIAL IS WORSE THAN THAT. THIS ELECTORAL FICTION HE'S PEDDLING IS WORSE THAN THAT. AND SO IT'S A VERY SCARY THING.
POD1000000043_S0000299	I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THAT MAYBE DEMOCRATS CAN WIN, BUT THE ODDS ARE THAT 2022 IS GOING TO BE BRUTAL BECAUSE OF REDISTRICTING, AND SO WE SHOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.
POD1000000043_S0000300	AND I DON'T KNOW THE WAY AROUND IT. LIKE I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL GET TIRED OF A SHTICK, BUT THAT WAS MY HOPE IN 2015 AND THEN 16. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY HAPPENED AND OBVIOUSLY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
POD1000000043_S0000301	I HATE TO SAY IT GUYS LIKE, WELL, ONE OBVIOUS THING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS WINNING THESE GEORGIA RUNOFFS. BUT THEN I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT IT WOULD IT WOULD ALSO HELP. I THINK IF BRIAN KEMP SURVIVED HIS PRIMARY CHALLENGE.
POD1000000043_S0000302	THAT'S GOING TO COME. I MEAN, LIKE WE NEED SOME ANTI TRUMP REPUBLICANS TO START WINNING SO THAT THEY'RE ALL NOT LIVING IN FEAR OF A PRIMARY CHALLENGE FROM A TRUMP BACKED CANDIDATE. OTHERWISE, THE GUY IS JUST GOING TO HOLD A GRIP ON THE PARTY.
POD1000000043_S0000303	I GREW UP ON FOX NEWS, I GREW UP ON NEWSMAX, AND WE'RE STUCK IN THIS CYCLE. I THINK WE HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL. I MEAN, I DON'T I JUST LIKE THERE'S NO I LOOK, I KNOW HOW HARD THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE IN 2022. I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE REALIZES THIS, BUT IT'S GOING TO IT WAS GOING TO BE HARD NO MATTER WHAT. NOW WITH REDISTRICTING, IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HARDER.
POD1000000043_S0000304	BUT LIKE, I DON'T SEE AN OPTION BESIDES WINNING THE HOUSE OR HOLDING THE HOUSE IN 2022.
POD1000000043_S0000305	BECAUSE IF LIKE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERN OVER DONALD TRUMP SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNED THIS ELECTION IS IS A LITTLE OVERHYPED.
POD1000000043_S0000306	BECAUSE WE HAVE DEMOCRATS IN ALL THE RIGHT POSITIONS, BECAUSE WE CONTROL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, BECAUSE WE CONTROL THE GOVERNORSHIPS IN WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, AND PENNSYLVANIA. LIKE, THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THAT I FELT SAFE.
POD1000000043_S0000307	IN SAYING THAT JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. IF WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE IN 2024, NOT ONLY DO I THINK THEY'LL HAVE IMPEACHED JOE BIDEN BY THEN, THEY'LL JUST MAKE UP SOME REASON TO DO THAT.
POD1000000043_S0000308	BUT THEN IN THE 2024 ELECTION, IF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE OR IF IT'S TRUMP PULLS WHAT TRUMP PULLED AGAIN, IT GOES TO CONGRESS AND NOW YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE.
POD1000000043_S0000309	AND DO WE REALLY THINK THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE IS GOING TO PLAY BY THE RULES AFTER WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME? I DON'T THINK SO.
POD1000000043_S0000310	YEAH, I THINK WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THE FACT THAT THIS COUP WILL FAIL AND THAT ITS INSTIGATORS ARE SILLY AND BUFFOONISH FROM HOW DANGEROUS THIS MOMENT IS. I DON'T THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S SORT OF TRIVIAL. I THINK WE ALL GET THAT.
POD1000000043_S0000311	BUT THEN I DO THINK THEN THERE'S THIS PROBLEM. IT'S LIKE, OK, WELL, WHAT DO WE DO? WELL, WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO WIN ELECTIONS. AND THE PROBLEM IS WE JUST RAN A NATIONAL ELECTION.
POD1000000043_S0000312	IN WHICH WE WON, WE WON BY 4.5% OF THE VOTE, BUT GIVEN WHERE OUR VOTERS ARE, GIVEN SOME OF THE INHERENT ANTI DEMOCRATIC ASPECTS OF THE SENATE,
POD1000000043_S0000313	IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO WIN THE SENATE, AND WE STILL MANAGED TO LOSE SOME HOUSE SEATS. AND THOSE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. WE'RE NOT ABOLISHING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
POD1000000043_S0000314	IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE'RE NOT GETTING RID OF THE SENATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME REALLY BAD REDISTRICTING THAT'S GOING TO HURT US BECAUSE WE DID SO POORLY IN LEGISLATURES.
POD1000000043_S0000315	AND SO TO ME, LIKE, I DO THINK WE HAVE TO SPLIT THESE THINGS INTO KIND OF TWO BIG, DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. ONE IS HOW DO WE WIN INSIDE OF DEMOCRACY? AND THE OTHER IS HOW DO WE PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND FIGHT FOR IT AGAINST A PARTY THAT HAS ABANDONED
POD1000000043_S0000316	I NO LONGER AM INTERESTED IN STORIES ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS BEHIND THE SCENES SAY THEY DON'T REALLY MEAN IT. NO, YOU DO MEAN IT. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE NOT IN PRIVATE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T SUPPORT WHAT YOU SUPPORT.
POD1000000043_S0000317	BUT ACTUALLY IN PRIVATE YOU'RE PRETENDING TO HOLD A SET OF BELIEFS THAT NOTHING IN YOUR POLITICS, NOTHING IN YOUR PUBLIC STATEMENTS IS TRUE. YOU'RE PRETENDING TO NOT BELIEVE IT WHILE EVERYTHING YOU DO SUBVERTS DEMOCRACY.
POD1000000043_S0000318	TED CRUZ IS NOT PUTTING ON A SHOW. TED CRUZ IS DOING WHAT HE THINKS IS IN HIS BEST INTEREST. HE'S NOT DOING IT. HE'S NOT GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND. HE'S NOT SAYING HE WANTS TO ARGUE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF TRUMP. HE'S CHOSEN A SIDE. HE'S SEEN WHERE HIS PEOPLE ARE GOING SO THAT HE CAN LEAD THEM.
POD1000000043_S0000319	WHAT THEY LEARNED FROM TRUMP IS THAT SHAME IS NOT A USEFUL ATTRIBUTE TO HAVE IN POLITICS. SO THEY ARE ALL SHAMELESS. YOU CANNOT SHAME THESE PEOPLE. ALL WE DO IS, OH, THESE REPUBLICANS GOT TO LEARN BETTER. WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM.
POD1000000043_S0000320	WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY PRESSURE ON THEM. THEY DON'T PRESSURE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR. SHAME IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR ANYMORE. THEY HAVE TO BE BEATEN. THAT'S LIKE I KNOW WE, YOU KNOW, WE, WE DID WIN THIS TIME AND HE TRIED TO STEAL IT, BUT IT WAS ENOUGH.
POD1000000043_S0000321	IT WAS A BIG ENOUGH MARGIN THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO STEAL IT. AND THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IN THE FUTURE IS TO BEAT THESE PEOPLE. AND LIKE YOU SAID, WE'RE NOT GONNA ELIMINATE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BEFORE THEN, BEFORE WE BEAT THEM. WE'RE NOT GONNA FIX GERRYMANDERING BEFORE WE BEAT THEM.
POD1000000043_S0000322	WE'RE NOT GONNA FIX THE SENATE BEFORE WE BEAT THEM. ALL ROADS LEAD BACK TO BEATING THEM IN ELECTIONS. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE.
POD1000000043_S0000323	YEAH, AND I WOULD SAY TO LIKE THE NEXT. THE CONVERSATION WE SHOULD HAVE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ABOUT SHAME, BUT I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING. I DO THINK IT'S A MUCH LONGER TERM CHALLENGE THAN EVEN WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO ELECTORALLY TO KEEP THE HOUSE AND TO KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE.
POD1000000043_S0000324	AND IT IS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE SHAMELESS, THEY'RE MERCENARIES, THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY THINK IS IN THEIR INTEREST. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T VIEW DEFENDING DEMOCRACY AS IN THEIR INTEREST, RIGHT? THAT THAT PROPAGANDA HAS SO THOROUGHLY TAKEN HOLD, RIGHT?
POD1000000043_S0000325	LIKE, WHEN YOU SAY LIKE THEY DON'T RESPOND TO SHAME, LIKE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS THAT LIKE VIRTUE, INTEGRITY, THESE QUALITIES NO LONGER MATTER IN OUR POLITICS. BEING HONEST, CARING ABOUT THE BASIC CIVIC IDEAS THAT ARE THE BEDROCK OF OUR COUNTRY, THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE.
POD1000000043_S0000326	WHICH TELLS US SOMETHING, WHICH IS LIKE, LIKE IT OR NOT, YEAH, OUR INSTITUTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN JUST STRONG ENOUGH TO GET US THROUGH THIS.
POD1000000043_S0000327	RIGHT? BUT LIKE THIS FASCISTIC WAY OF THINKING, LIKE IT'S TAKEN HOLD OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT'S TAKEN HOLD OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY DANGEROUS. AND WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE INCENTIVES AND THOSE LEVERS BECAUSE THIS WILL GET WORSE UNLESS WE START LOOKING UPRIVER.
POD1000000043_S0000328	WHEN WE START LOOKING AT PROPAGANDA, WHAT FACEBOOK IS DOING, WHAT FOX NEWS IS DOING, AND ACTUALLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE COMBAT IT, HOW WE DON'T JUST LAMENT IT, BUT WE ACTUALLY COMBAT IT.

LOST ALL THEIR LEGAL CHALLENGES, COULDN'T PRESSURE ANY REPUBLICAN ELECTION OFFICIALS TO ILLEGALLY REFUSE CERTIFICATION OF THE RESULTS, COULDN'T FIND ANY REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURES TO ILLEGALLY SEND THEIR OWN SLATE OF ELECTORS.
POD1000000043_S0000388	SO NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT JANUARY 6TH, WHICH IS WHEN THE ELECTORAL VOTES ARE OFFICIALLY TALLIED IN CONGRESS AND READ ALOUD BY NONE OTHER THAN THE VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE. SO THAT'S FUN.
POD1000000043_S0000389	HERE'S THE RULES, IF A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND A SENATOR TOGETHER BOTH RAISE AN OBJECTION TO A SLATE OF ELECTORS, BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS HAVE TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO REJECT OR ACCEPT THE OBJECTION.
POD1000000043_S0000390	OF COURSE, ALREADY A FEW HOUSE REPUBLICANS, NO SURPRISE THERE, THEY'RE ALL FUCKING YAHOOS. AND A FEW SENATORS LIKE RON JOHNSON OF WISCONSIN HAVE SAID THEY MAY OBJECT.
POD1000000043_S0000391	LIKE, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK BECAUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND WILL VOTE DOWN THE OBJECTION. AND THERE ARE NOW ENOUGH SENATORS IN THE SENATE WHO HAVE SAID THAT JOE BIDEN IS PRESIDENT, ENOUGH REPUBLICAN SENATORS
POD1000000043_S0000392	THAT THERE'S ALSO A PRO DEMOCRACY MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. SO IT'S NOT GONNA WORK, BUT IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT IT'S NOW GOING TO PUT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE ON RECORD
POD1000000043_S0000393	AS WHETHER YOU WERE FOR OR AGAINST THE COUP ATTEMPT. AND SO THE ONES WHO ARE TRYING TO HIDE, LIKE MARCO RUBIO, BY JUST DOING THE HAND WAVE THING, THEY'D BE LIKE, FORGET ABOUT THE COUP, IT'S THE LEFT WING OUTRAGE THAT'S A PROBLEM.
POD1000000043_S0000394	A LEFT WING OUTRAGE ABOUT THE COUP THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM.
POD1000000043_S0000396	I'M NOT TAKING THIS BEYOND TWITTER. I'VE SAID WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ON TWITTER. I'M NOT GOING TO BRING IT TO OUR PODCAST. DIDN'T A COUPLE DEMOCRATS OBJECT TO BUSH V. GORE AND THEY COULDN'T FIND A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TO DO IT AND IT KIND OF WENT BY THE WAYSIDE?
POD1000000043_S0000397	YEAH, IN 2004, THEY DID IT WITH CARRIE IN OHIO TOO. BUT LIKE, THIS IS MADNESS.
POD1000000043_S0000398	AND IT'LL GO NOWHERE. IT'LL GO NOWHERE. AND THIS TIME THEY'LL HAVE A SENATOR, BUT IT'LL STILL GO NOWHERE.
POD1000000043_S0000399	THIS IS DRINK THE KOOL AID. THIS IS THEIR MOMENT. ALL OF THEM WILL BE ON RECORD. OH, SHOULD WE CALL IT THE COUP?
POD1000000043_S0000400	LID WITH THE P THAT WORKS.
POD1000000043_S0000402	THANKS GUYS. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A GOOD OR A BAD THING TO HAVE ALL THESE GUYS ON THE RECORD.
POD1000000043_S0000403	AS FOR AGAINST THE COUP ATTEMPT, I'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S A GOOD THING. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE COULD HOLD IT AGAINST THEM IN ELECTIONS. I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. IT'S NOT LIKE.
POD1000000043_S0000404	I THINK IT'S GONNA BE SAD. I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE SAD. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A SAD MOMENT.
POD1000000043_S0000405	EVERY TRUMP THING STARTS AS LIKE ZANY, BUT THEN HE JUST GOES ALL IN ON EVERY MADDENING, INSANE, RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT HE LATCHES ONTO. AND HERE WE ARE. I DON'T KNOW.
POD1000000043_S0000406	IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING IRONICALLY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU SAY. YES. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
POD1000000043_S0000407	ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE TYPING LOL
POD1000000043_S0000409	I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY SAD MOMENT BECAUSE LIKE ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE STOOD UP REALLY WELL DURING THE COUP ATTEMPT IS THE JUDICIARY. AND WE'VE SEEN, YOU KNOW, LIBERAL JUDGES, CONSERVATIVE JUDGES, TRUMP JUDGES ALL THROW OUT THESE CHALLENGES.
POD1000000043_S0000410	BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, SELECTING A PRESIDENT COMES DOWN TO CONGRESS. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA GET A BUNCH OF REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBERS WHO OBJECT, WHO CARES ABOUT THEM. THEY MAY GET RON JOHNSON OR TED CRUZ OR RAND PAUL OR
POD1000000043_S0000411	ONE OF THE BUCK NUTS IN THE SENATE TO JOIN THEM. AND THEN BOTH HOUSES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO VOTE, WHICH MEANS THAT IN THE FUTURE, IF THEY DO THIS, IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER WHAT THE COURTS DO.
POD1000000043_S0000412	IF THE COURTS THROW THEM OUT, BECAUSE IT'LL ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO THE JANUARY 6TH MOMENT IN CONGRESS. AND WHAT IF YOU HAVE A MAJORITY IN CONGRESS ONE OF THESE DAYS THAT SAYS, YEAH, WE'RE GONNA THROW OUT SOME, WE'RE GONNA THROW OUT SOME ELECTORS AND OVERTURN THE RESULTS. THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. THAT'S ALL IT TAKES IS JUST CONGRESS DOING THAT.
POD1000000043_S0000413	BIT BY BIT.
POD1000000043_S0000415	LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DAMAGE THAT THE COUP ATTEMPT IS ALREADY DOING BEYOND OUR REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS. THE TEXAS REPUBLICAN PARTY RESPONDED TO THE SUPREME COURT DECISION BY CALLING FOR SECESSION.
POD1000000043_S0000416	THAT'S TRUE, THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. ALEX JONES SAID THAT JOE BIDEN QUOTE, WILL BE REMOVED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
POD1000000043_S0000417	SIDNEY POWELL, A FORMER MEMBER OF TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM, JOINED OTHER MAGA LUNATICS IN CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO SUSPEND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND SET UP MILITARY TRIBUNALS.
POD1000000043_S0000418	MANY OF THESE LUNATICS DESCENDED ON WASHINGTON OVER THE WEEKEND WHERE RIGHT WING POWER MILITARY GROUPS LIKE THE PROUD BOYS ATTACKED POLICE, COUNTER PROTESTERS, AND DEFACED TWO HISTORIC BLACK CHURCHES. FOUR PEOPLE WERE STABBED AND 23 ARRESTED. LIKE, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
POD1000000043_S0000419	I THINK THESE THESE ARE FASCISTS. THESE PEOPLE ARE FASCISTS. AND THESE ARE THEIR BROWN SHIRTS. AND THEY'RE STORMING AROUND THROUGH WASHINGTON. AND IT IS INCREDIBLY SCARY AND UNSETTLING. AND WHERE WE GO FROM HERE FEELS UNCERTAIN TO ME.
POD1000000043_S0000420	I HOPE WE CAN GET THROUGH INAUGURATION AND LIKE JOE BIDEN WILL BE IN OFFICE AND MAYBE THESE PEOPLE CAN RECEDE TO THE BACK. BUT I DO THINK IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO TAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE FOR ALL OF US, THE MEDIA POLITICIANS TO STOP COVERING DONALD TRUMP.
POD1000000043_S0000421	LIKE HE'S THE NATIONAL NARRATOR OF ALL US EVENTS. WE CANNOT CENTER THIS MAN IN OUR POLITICS FOR FOUR MORE YEARS.
POD1000000043_S0000422	AND RID OURSELVES OF THE CANCER OF THIS MAGA FASCIST MINDSET. WE HAVE TO TRY TO MOVE ON FROM HIM SOMEHOW. WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS AND ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THINGS THAT MATTER.
POD1000000043_S0000423	OR OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK HERE IN FOUR YEARS AND HE'S GOING TO BE THE GOP NOMINEE AND GOD KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
POD1000000043_S0000425	IT WAS SUCH A SPLIT SCREEN MOMENT FOR ME OVER THE WEEKEND AND JUST PREPPING FOR TODAY'S POD IS ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION AND IT'S THIS IT'S THIS EXAMPLE OF THE ENTIRE WORLD WORKING TOGETHER SCIENTISTS HEALTHCARE WORKERS.
POD1000000043_S0000426	TRUCKERS, POLITICIANS, EVERYONE COMING TOGETHER TO DO SOMETHING GOOD AND TRY TO GET PEOPLE VACCINATED. AND THEN YOU HAVE THESE FUCKING ASSHOLES DESCENDING ON WASHINGTON JUST TRYING TO BURN EVERYTHING DOWN, JUST TRYING TO BURN IT ALL DOWN.
POD1000000043_S0000427	LIKE THESE PEOPLE ARE AWFUL, JUST AWFUL.
POD1000000043_S0000428	YEAH, AND I DO THINK WE NEED TO STOP TRYING TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE SILLY, BECAUSE THEY WRITE THINGS ON THEIR BUTTS, BECAUSE SIDNEY POWELL IS A BAD LAWYER, BECAUSE RUDY GIULIANI'S FACE MELTED.
POD1000000043_S0000429	LIKE, WE NEED TO STOP TAKING COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT THEY'RE SILLY BECAUSE, LIKE, EVERY DANGEROUS, VIOLENT, REVANCHIST, ANTI DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IS SILLY IN SOME SENSE.
POD1000000043_S0000430	IF THEY WEREN'T DUMB, IF THEY WEREN'T BUFFOONISH, THEY WOULDN'T SUPPORT THAT MOVEMENT. AND SO LIKE, WE SHOULD JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THE MOST DANGEROUS AND REACTIONARY FORCES THAT HAVE HAD HUGE IMPACT ON THIS COUNTRY
POD1000000043_S0000431	THAT HAVE PULLED THIS COUNTRY BACKWARDS IN OUR HISTORY WERE GENIUSES. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE BECAUSE WHEN YOU EMPLOY VIOLENCE, WHEN YOU INTRODUCE THE SPECTER OF VIOLENCE ACROSS OUR POLITICS, IT
POD1000000043_S0000432	CAN WORK THINGS AND CHANGE THINGS WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO BE VERY SOPHISTICATED. AND I JUST THINK THAT REQUIRES, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. I DON'T, IT'S, BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE ALL SHOULD KEEP IN MIND.
POD1000000043_S0000433	AND LIKE DON'T TAKE COMFORT IN THEIR STUPIDITY. WE JUST CAN'T.
POD1000000043_S0000435	YEAH, IT IS. IT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION OF HOW BIG THEIR NUMBERS ARE. AND PART OF THIS IS MAKING SURE THE NUMBERS DON'T GET BIGGER. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE ASSHOLES WHO DESCENDED ON D.C., BUT THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE WHO COULD FALL INTO THAT KIND OF TRAP.
POD1000000043_S0000436	AND YOU WANT TO AVOID THAT. I MEAN, LIKE THERE WAS A NEW CBS POLL OUT OVER THE WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, AND IT GIVES THE USUAL NUMBERS. ONLY 18 PERCENT OF TRUMP VOTERS THINK BIDEN'S THE LEGITIMATE WINNER OF THE ELECTION. FORTY NINE PERCENT THINK TRUMP SHOULD REFUSE TO CONCEDE, EVEN IF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES FOR BIDEN, WHICH THEY WILL.
POD1000000043_S0000437	AND 75 PERCENT THINK REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS SHOULD TRY TO KEEP TRUMP IN POWER. BUT THEN I SAW AT THE END, THE LAST QUESTION WAS 40 PERCENT OF TRUMP VOTERS BELIEVE THAT IF BIDEN IS THE PRESIDENT,
POD1000000043_S0000438	THAT TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH BIDEN ON MAKING PROGRESS, WHICH WAS SURPRISING BECAUSE I'M LIKE THESE SAME PEOPLE WHO THINK THE ELECTION IS NOT LEGITIMATE, YOU KNOW, 60% OF THEM THINK NEVER WORK WITH BIDEN ON ANYTHING. SO THAT'S STILL A MAJORITY.
POD1000000043_S0000439	BUT THAT 40% MIGHT BE WHERE YOU BEGIN, YOU KNOW, LIKE, BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE AT THIS POINT.
POD1000000043_S0000440	WELL, I ALSO JUST THINK IT'S INTERESTING, TOO. IT'S IMPORTANT, TOO, BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES ALSO SHOW YOU IS THAT THESE ARE IN SOME SENSE PERFORMATIVE REACTIONS, EVEN TO POLLSTERS. WE'RE ALL PUNDITS NOW. WE'RE ALL ON A TEAM.
POD1000000043_S0000441	AND THAT'S A GOOD THING IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THINGS THEY DON'T TOTALLY MEAN. IT'S A DANGEROUS THING IN WHICH BELIEFS THEMSELVES ARE NOW HOW YOU DEMONSTRATE YOU'RE FILTHY, WHICH MEANS NOBODY IS GOING TO BE TELLING THE TRUTH.
POD1000000043_S0000442	AND YOU KNOW, LIKE, SORRY, I'M GONNA DO IT. VONNEGUT, THE QUOTE, WHICH I THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME THESE DAYS IS, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE WHAT YOU PRETEND TO BE, SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRETEND TO BE. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
POD1000000043_S0000443	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND WHAT THEY THINK IS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND WHAT THEY PERFORM IS WHAT BECOMES OUR POLITICS.
POD1000000043_S0000444	I'M GOING TO FOLLOW SUIT HERE. SO I WAS READING OBAMA'S BOOK AND THEN I STARTED READING LIKE AN OLD BOOK I HAD FROM COLLEGE FROM VÁCLAV HAVEL, WHO WAS A PLAYWRIGHT, WRITER, THINKER, POLITICAL LEADER IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC.
POD1000000043_S0000445	AND HE TALKS ABOUT SORT OF HOW EVERY COUNTRY, EVERY CULTURE, EVERY SOCIETY HAS THESE SORT OF POLLS, RIGHT? THERE'S ALWAYS SORT OF A FASCISTIC CAMP AND THERE'S ALWAYS A MORE HOPEFUL CAMP. AND IT IS UP TO THE LEADERS TO DECIDE WHICH ONE OF THOSE YOU AWAKEN.
POD1000000043_S0000446	AND TRUMP HAS SPENT FOUR TO SIX YEARS AWAKENING THE SCARY, FASCISTIC RIGHT WING CAMP. AND THE NEXT REPUBLICAN, LIKE RONALD REAGAN WAS AWFUL. HE DID IMMEASURABLE DAMAGE TO THIS COUNTRY.
POD1000000043_S0000447	BUT HE DIDN'T DO THAT. AND WE BARELY SURVIVED THAT. AND THE NEXT SET OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS BETTER BE PRETTY GODDAMN CAREFUL.
POD1000000043_S0000448	ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY DECIDE TO REAWAKEN THOSE FASCISTIC FORCES, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THOSE PEOPLE WERE THERE IN D.C. OVER THE WEEKEND SAYING, CHANTING, DESTROY THE GOP, BECAUSE THEY WON'T GO ALONG WITH A COUP ATTEMPT. SO, YEAH, THAT SHIT WILL BITE YOU BACK.
POD1000000043_S0000449	WELL, AND YOU KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT FUTURE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, BUT IT'S ALSO THIS IS THIS WAS PART OF JOE BIDEN'S MESSAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN, TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO PROJECT TO THE COUNTRY AND WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
POD1000000043_S0000450	AND DO I HAVE A LOT OF OPTIMISM THAT JOE BIDEN AND MITCH MCCONNELL ARE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND HAMMER OUT SOME DEALS TOGETHER? NO, I DON'T. BUT I THINK BIDEN'S MESSAGE WAS BIGGER THAN I'M GOING TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS. IT'S ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY AND HEALING THE NATION.
POD1000000043_S0000451	AND I THINK PROJECTING THAT IMAGE TO THE COUNTRY, IT MATTERS.
POD1000000043_S0000453	AND OH, BY THE WAY, LET'S ADD TO THE LIST, AS HE PROJECTS THAT VISION TO THE COUNTRY, HE ALSO, PERHAPS WITHOUT A SENATE, HOPEFULLY WITH A SENATE THAT'S INCREDIBLY DIVIDED REGARDLESS,
POD1000000043_S0000454	HE HAS TO DELIVER. AND THAT'S LIKE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE CAN DO TO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM THIS, WHICH IS DELIVER.
POD1000000043_S0000455	100%.
POD1000000043_S0000456	WELL, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE FOR TODAY. AND EVERYONE CHECK OUT POD SAVE THE WORLD FOR THE BIG OBAMA INTERVIEW THIS WEEK. AND WE'LL TALK TO YOU GUYS ON THURSDAY.

POD1000000044_S0000034	YEAH.
POD1000000044_S0000035	OKAY, YOUR EYES CLOSED.
POD1000000044_S0000036	HMM. ANYTHING YOU SEE WHERE THERE'S SOME FEELINGS, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. OK.
POD1000000044_S0000037	THIS IS A THERAPIST NAMED ALVIN IN SESSION WITH A PATIENT NAMED TED
POD1000000044_S0000038	WHAT ARE YOU FEELING? CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT? LIKE IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? RIGHT NOW?
POD1000000044_S0000039	THE SESSION WAS RECORDED AS A PART OF AN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY VIDEO SERIES. IN THE SESSION, ALVIN IS HELPING TED RELIVE A MEMORY. THE TIME AS DOMINEERING FATHER IN LAW WAS RUDE TO HIS WIFE.
POD1000000044_S0000040	YEAH. AND HE'S ALL DRESSED UP.
POD1000000044_S0000041	HI, JENNY. OH, THERE HE IS.
POD1000000044_S0000042	AND HE'S, YEAH, THERE'S A FORMAL THING. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE HAVE TO, IT'S LIKE THE MINUTE WE TALK TO EACH OTHER, OUR VOICES DROP.
POD1000000044_S0000043	HI, HOW ARE YOU? YES, YES.
POD1000000044_S0000044	ALVIN'S EYES ARE SHUT TIGHT. HIS METHOD IS TO TRY TO WILL HIMSELF INTO THE PATIENT'S SKIN TO FEEL WHAT THE PATIENT IS FEELING.
POD1000000044_S0000045	I CAN DO THIS BETTER THAN YOU. WATCH ME.

POD1000000044_S0000048	I'M DOING BETTER THAN YOU, HUH?
POD1000000044_S0000049	YEAH.
POD1000000044_S0000050	ALVIN DOES VOICES AND ROLE PLAYS, AND AT TIMES THE SESSION FEELS LIKE AVANT GARDE IMPROV.
POD1000000044_S0000051	THAT SON OF A
POD1000000044_S0000052	IT'S PLAYFUL AND HONESTLY KIND OF BIZARRE, BUT THE POINT OF IT ALL IS TO HELP THE PATIENT REHEARSE BEHAVIOR IN THE OFFICE THAT HE CAN THEN APPLY IN REAL LIFE.
POD1000000044_S0000053	TOUCH HER! TOUCH HER!
POD1000000044_S0000054	OH, GEE.
POD1000000044_S0000056	YEAH, HOLDER.
POD1000000044_S0000058	THANK YOU SO MUCH.
POD1000000044_S0000059	BY THE END OF THE SESSION, ALVIN HAS TURNED TED, A MEEK, BUTTONED UP PATIENT, INTO SOMEONE CAPABLE OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF EMOTIONALLY.
POD1000000044_S0000060	GONNA BE THIS WAY WITH JENNY BECAUSE YOU REHEARSED IT
POD1000000044_S0000061	WE GOT IT, HUH?
POD1000000044_S0000062	I'M READY!
POD1000000044_S0000064	WE HAVE THIS ABILITY WITHIN US TO BECOME A WHOLE NEW PERSON.
POD1000000044_S0000066	ALVIN DIED IN 2014. BUT THIS IS HOWARD, A PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND ONE OF ALVIN'S DISCIPLES. HOWARD RUNS ALVIN'S WEBSITE AND PUBLISHES HIS BOOKS.
POD1000000044_S0000067	ARE YOU TALKING A LITTLE HYPERBOLICALLY WHEN YOU SAY A WHOLE NEW PERSON?
POD1000000044_S0000068	NO, IT IS THAT RADICAL JONATHAN. IT'S TO BECOME A WHOLE NEW PERSON. THE TERM HE USED IS AN OPTIMAL PERSON AND TO DISCOVER THAT WITHIN YOURSELF.
POD1000000044_S0000070	ACCORDING TO ALVIN, ONCE YOU'VE DISCOVERED THIS OPTIMAL PERSONHOOD, YOU CAN SHAKE OFF WHAT OTHERS WANT AND LIVE ON YOUR OWN TERMS.
POD1000000044_S0000071	IT CHANGED MY LIFE DIRECTION.
POD1000000044_S0000072	AND FOR THESE KINDS OF RADICAL RESULTS, ALVIN WAS GIVEN A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.
POD1000000044_S0000073	ONE PSYCHOLOGY TEXTBOOK EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO DESCRIBE ALVIN AS BEING, QUOTE, AS IMPORTANT AS FREUD.
POD1000000044_S0000075	BUT THIS ISN'T A STORY ABOUT ALVIN'S PROFESSIONAL LIFE, HIS LIFE INSIDE THE OFFICE. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ALVIN'S REAL LIFE.
POD1000000044_S0000076	HE INSISTED I RUN AWAY.
POD1000000044_S0000077	THIS IS RACHEL, ALVIN'S DAUGHTER.
POD1000000044_S0000078	AND I DID.
POD1000000044_S0000079	HOW OLD WERE YOU?
POD1000000044_S0000080	I WAS IN GRADE FIVE.
POD1000000044_S0000081	THE YEAR WAS 1970. ALVIN AND RACHEL'S MOM HAD BEEN LOCKED IN AN UGLY CUSTODY BATTLE FOR EIGHT YEARS.
POD1000000044_S0000082	RACHEL'S MOM WAS POOR AND STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION. RACHEL REALLY WANTED TO LIVE WITH HER DAD. SO WHEN ALVIN SUGGESTED SHE RUN AWAY FROM JUDY IN DENVER TO HIS HOUSE IN OHIO, RACHEL DIDN'T PACK A BAG. SHE DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO ANYONE.
POD1000000044_S0000083	SHE JUST LAUGHED.
POD1000000044_S0000084	LIKE HE SET UP THIS WHOLE THING WITH HIS LAWYER AND I JUST FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO DO WHAT MY DAD AND THE LAWYER TOLD ME AND THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING. I THINK I SAID I WAS GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND
POD1000000044_S0000085	BUT SOMEHOW, I DON'T REMEMBER HOW I GOT TO THE LAWYER'S OFFICE, AND THEN THEY TOOK ME TO THE AIRPORT AND PUT ME ON THE PLANE AND I LEFT.
POD1000000044_S0000087	ALVIN HAD GOTTEN REMARRIED TO A WOMAN WITH TWO KIDS, AND RACHEL LOVED FEELING LIKE SHE WAS A PART OF THIS HAPPY FAMILY. THERE WERE DOGS TO PLAY WITH AND BIKES TO RIDE. AND YET, THIS OTHER FEELING WOULD OFTEN CREEP IN.
POD1000000044_S0000088	I MISS MY MOM, I MISS MY FRIENDS, I MISS MY CAT, BUT I COULD NEVER, EVER, EVER SAY THAT OUT LOUD TO ANYBODY.
POD1000000044_S0000089	AND THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE RACHEL MISSED. MISSED MOST OF ALL.
POD1000000044_S0000091	SHE TOLD US SHE WAS GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND THEN SHE NEVER CAME BACK.
POD1000000044_S0000092	THIS IS RACHEL'S BROTHER JOHN. HE'S TWO AND A HALF YEARS YOUNGER THAN RACHEL AND ONLY HAS FLASHES OF EARLY CHILDHOOD MEMORY ABOUT ALVIN.
POD1000000044_S0000093	HE RECALLS DOING FATHER SON THINGS THAT'D MAKE PERFECT SENSE IF THE SON WAS AN ADULT. THINGS LIKE LIFTING WEIGHTS TOGETHER AND SMOKING.
POD1000000044_S0000094	HE WAS A PIPE SMOKER. HE BOUGHT ME MY OWN LITTLE CHERRY WOOD PIPE AND YOU KNOW AS A FOUR YEAR OLD HE ACTUALLY HAD ME SMOKING YOU KNOW TOBACCO IN THE PIPE WITH HIM.
POD1000000044_S0000095	IT WAS AS THOUGH ALVIN COULDN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN, WHICH WAS WHY HE SAW JOHN'S CLOSENESS WITH HIS MOM NOT AS A CHILD'S NATURAL MATERNAL ATTACHMENT, BUT RATHER AS A PERSONAL SLIGHT.
POD1000000044_S0000096	AND SO ALVIN NEVER ASKED JOHN TO RUN AWAY. JOHN WAS LEFT BEHIND IN DENVER WITH JUDY.
POD1000000044_S0000097	I THINK IN HIS MIND I JUST, YOU KNOW, WAS MORE A MAMA'S BOY AND A CHIP OFF JUDY'S BLOCK AND I THINK HE SORT OF GAVE UP ON ME. AND HE WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON RACHEL.
POD1000000044_S0000098	AND AS THE FINAL CUSTODY HEARING APPROACHED, ALVIN'S FOCUS ON RACHEL INTENSIFIED. HE WANTED TO PROVE TO THE COURT THAT RACHEL WAS BETTER OFF WITH HIM. SO HE HAD ABOUT A HALF DOZEN SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS OFFER ASSESSMENTS.
POD1000000044_S0000099	RACHEL WAS INTERVIEWED AND ALVIN'S NEW FAMILY OBSERVED. NONE OF THE EXPERTS SPOKE TO JUDY. AND THE PLAN WORKED.
POD1000000044_S0000100	IN THE AUTUMN OF 1970, A JUDGE RULED THAT RACHEL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN OHIO WITH AL FOR GOOD, BUT JOHN WOULD REMAIN IN DENVER WITH JUDY.
POD1000000044_S0000101	AND WE NEVER LIVED TOGETHER AGAIN.
POD1000000044_S0000103	WHEN YOU HAVE A SIBLING WHO IS JUST A CRITICAL PART OF YOUR FAMILY, AND THEN YOU'RE SEPARATED FROM THEM, IT'S A WOUND.
POD1000000044_S0000104	HOW UNCOMMON WAS AN ARRANGEMENT LIKE THAT?
POD1000000044_S0000105	EXTREME, YEAH, VERY, VERY UNCOMMON. KIDS ARE NOT SPLIT UP.
POD1000000044_S0000106	WE EACH GREW UP ALONE. I MISSED HER THROUGH MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD. I MISSED HER A LOT.
POD1000000044_S0000107	I MEAN, WE WERE SO CLOSE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG, AND, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS THE BIG SISTER WHO, THROUGH ALL OF THAT, WAS LOOKING OUT FOR ME.
POD1000000044_S0000109	GROWING UP FROM THEN ON, JUST ME AND MY MOM GREW UP AS AN ONLY CHILD AND MY MOM JUST ALWAYS BEING IN PAIN AND
POD1000000044_S0000110	SHE NEVER WAS ABLE TO ENJOY WHATEVER IT IS WE WERE DOING AT THE MOMENT. IT WAS ALWAYS, OH, IF ONLY RACHEL WERE HERE, WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER. AND I'D BE SAYING, BUT WE'RE HERE NOW.
POD1000000044_S0000112	WHEN HE TURNED 13, JOHN INVITED RACHEL TO HIS BAR MITZVAH, BUT ALVIN WOULDN'T LET HER GO. RACHEL SENT A POEM INSTEAD.
POD1000000044_S0000113	IT HAD TO DO WITH A RUBBER BAND STRETCHING ACROSS THE DISTANCE AND CONNECTING US.
POD1000000044_S0000115	FOR JOHN, NOT ONLY DID HE LOSE HIS BIG SISTER, HE ALSO LOST HIS DAD. YEAR AFTER YEAR, JOHN TRIED TO RE ENTER ALVIN'S LIFE. BUT EACH TIME HE REACHED OUT, ALVIN REBUKED HIM.
POD1000000044_S0000116	ONE TIME, AS AN ADOLESCENT, JOHN TRIED SCHEDULING A VISIT.
POD1000000044_S0000117	AND HE SAID, WELL, AS LONG AS YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW, ME AND MY MOM REQUIRED ANY MONEY, ANY CHILD SUPPORT, THERE'D BE NO VISIT.
POD1000000044_S0000118	AND I SAID, WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CARE MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN ABOUT ME. AND HE SAID, WELL, I DON'T WANT IT TO JUST SOUND LIKE THAT. THAT'S HOW IT IS.
POD1000000044_S0000120	NEVERTHELESS, A FEW YEARS LATER, JOHN ASKED ONCE AGAIN IF HE COULD COME VISIT. BY THIS POINT, RACHEL WAS 18 AND NO LONGER LIVING WITH ALVIN.
POD1000000044_S0000121	SO WHEN ALVIN REFUSED JOHN YET AGAIN, RACHEL TOLD HER BROTHER TO COME VISIT HER INSTEAD. THEY HADN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN EIGHT YEARS. WAS SHE THE SAME SISTER THAT YOU REMEMBERED?
POD1000000044_S0000122	NO, I MEAN, I KNEW HER AS A, YOU KNOW,
POD1000000044_S0000124	SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN YEAR OLD. NEXT TIME I SAW HER, SHE WAS AN ADULT.
POD1000000044_S0000126	IN THE YEARS SINCE THAT VISIT, RACHEL AND JOHN HAVE MADE A POINT OF STAYING IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES. THEY TALK ON THE PHONE, CELEBRATE HOLIDAYS TOGETHER, AND ONCE A YEAR THEIR FAMILIES ALL TAKE A TRIP. BUT THEIR CHILDHOOD TOGETHER, THAT'S BEEN LOST.
POD1000000044_S0000127	I MEAN, MY DAUGHTER CERTAINLY WATCHES US AND THINKS THAT WE'RE MORE LIKE COUSINS. SHE CAN SEE THE DISCONNECT BECAUSE WE DID NOT GROW UP TOGETHER.
POD1000000044_S0000128	JOHN AND RACHEL STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR CHILDHOOD. BUT NOW THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE BOTH DEAD, THEY HAVE NO ONE TO ASK. SO THEY PARSE THROUGH THEIR SEPARATE MEMORIES, TRYING TO CONSTRUCT A TIMELINE, COMPARING MOMENTS OF OVERLAP AND FILLING IN THE BLANKS.
POD1000000044_S0000129	TO THIS END, ONE NIGHT WHILE JOHN WAS VISITING RACHEL FOR THANKSGIVING, HE ASKED IF THEY COULD GO THROUGH ALVIN'S FILES.
POD1000000044_S0000131	ALVIN WAS AN OBSESSIVE RECORD KEEPER, AND AFTER HE DIED, RACHEL INHERITED HIS PAPERS. SHE'D NEVER REALLY GONE THROUGH THEM, KEEPING THEM STORED AWAY IN A FILING CABINET. BUT THAT NIGHT, SHE PULLED THEM OUT.
POD1000000044_S0000132	AND TOGETHER, JOHN AND RACHEL MADE A SERIES OF DISTURBING DISCOVERIES. THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS THE SCRIPT.
POD1000000044_S0000134	THE SCRIPT, FOR ME, WAS LIKE, OH MY GOD.
POD1000000044_S0000136	THE SCRIPT WAS A LENGTHY DIATRIBE WRITTEN BY ALVIN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CHILD, RACHEL'S POINT OF VIEW.
POD1000000044_S0000137	IN IT, ALVIN REFERS TO HIMSELF AS DADDY, JUDY AS MOTHER OR JUDY OR SIMPLY SHE. I LATER ASK RACHEL TO READ SOME OVER THE PHONE.
POD1000000044_S0000139	TWO AND A HALF PAGES LONG AND SMALL PSYCHOLOGIST RATING. OKAY, SO HERE I GO. IT'S IN MY GOOD HAPPY DREAMS, CUSTODY IS CHANGED AND I LIVE WITH DADDY.
POD1000000044_S0000140	IF I AM FORCED TO GO BACK AND LIVE WITH MOTHER, IT WILL ONLY BE TILL THE DAY I'M 14, WHICH APPARENTLY WAS WHEN YOU COULD DECIDE.
POD1000000044_S0000141	WHEN I'M WITH HER I FEEL SCARED THAT I MIGHT GET TIGHT AND ANGRY AND COLD LIKE JUDY. SHE'S NOT A MOTHER, SHE IS A KEEPER. SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M IN A PRISON. I CAN'T LET HER TOUCH ME.
POD1000000044_S0000142	IT WAS LIKE FINDING YOUR CHILDHOOD INTERNAL MONOLOGUE COMMITTED TO PAPER AND WRITTEN IN YOUR FATHER'S HANDWRITING. RACHEL DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING THE SCRIPT AS A KID, BUT SHE REMEMBERED SAYING THOSE THINGS, AND SHE REMEMBERED THINKING THEM.
POD1000000044_S0000143	IN ONE OF ALVIN'S MANY BOOKS, A VOLUME ENTITLED THE MANUAL OF OPTIMAL BEHAVIOR, HE WRITES THAT BEHAVIOR CAN BE REHEARSED AND MODIFIED, QUOTE, UNTIL YOU ARE READY AND EAGER TO GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE REHEARSED AND MODIFIED.
POD1000000044_S0000144	UNBEKNOWNST TO HER, ALVIN WAS HAVING RACHEL REHEARSE AND MODIFY.
POD1000000044_S0000145	IT WAS SO...
POD1000000044_S0000147	EXPLICIT. THERE WAS NOTHING SUBTLE ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE THING WAS SICK.
POD1000000044_S0000149	THE SECOND THING DISCOVERED AMONG THE FILES WAS A LETTER FROM RACHEL TO HER MOM. IN IT, SHE BEGS JUDY TO LET HER LIVE WITH ALVIN. BUT THERE WERE TWO COPIES, ONE WRITTEN IN RACHEL'S HAND AND ONE WRITTEN IN ALVIN'S.
POD1000000044_S0000151	GOING THROUGH THE PAPERS, RACHEL REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS. HOW ALVIN ENCOURAGED HER NOT TO SMILE WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOM, SAYING IF SOMEONE PHOTOGRAPHED HER HAPPY, IT COULD BE USED AS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM IN COURT.
POD1000000044_S0000152	IN EVERY PHOTO FROM THAT PERIOD WITH HER MOTHER, RACHEL IS WEARING A FROWN.
POD1000000044_S0000153	THAT'S WHEN I STARTED QUESTIONING AND STARTED TO REALIZE THAT I WAS COACHED OR BRAINWASHED.
POD1000000044_S0000155	IT MADE SENSE. FOR MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE, RACHEL HAD HAD NO MEMORY OF LOVING HER MOM. IT WAS ONLY AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH, WHEN SHE FOUND MOTHER'S DAY AND BIRTHDAY CARDS SHE'D WRITTEN TO JUDY WHEN SHE WAS VERY SMALL,
POD1000000044_S0000156	THAT RACHEL REALIZED SHE HAD. I LOVE YOU, MOMMY, SHE'D WRITTEN. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. BUT WITH AL'S CONSTANT COACHING, IT HAD ALL BEEN STAMPED OUT.
POD1000000044_S0000158	THE FINAL THING JOHN AND RACHEL FOUND THAT NIGHT WERE THOSE PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS ALVIN HAD RACHEL SUBMIT TO JUST BEFORE THE FINAL CUSTODY HEARING. IN THEM, YOU SEE ALVIN'S SCRIPTING BEAR OUT.
POD1000000044_S0000159	ONE REPORT NOTES THAT RACHEL KEPT REPEATING, QUOTE, I WANT TO LIVE WITH MY FATHER. HE LOVES ME. MY MOTHER DOESN'T LOVE ME. THE REPORT NOTES THAT SHE SAID THIS WITH, QUOTE, GRIM DETERMINATION.
POD1000000044_S0000161	THEY ALSO UNCOVERED ONE PARTICULAR REPORT THAT NIGHT THAT WAS LONGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS. IT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT EVALUATED BOTH JOHN AND RACHEL, AND IN THIS, IT CARRIED THE MOST WEIGHT.
POD1000000044_S0000163	AND WHAT SHOCKED JOHN AND RACHEL MOST OF ALL.
POD1000000044_S0000164	MY DAD CLEARLY EDITED IT AND THEN SHE REWROTE IT WITH THE EDITS AND SUBMITTED THAT REWRITE.
POD1000000044_S0000165	IS THAT ETHICAL AS A SOCIAL WORKER?
POD1000000044_S0000166	NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT. NO, OH NO, NO, NO. NO ONE SHOULD EVER LET ANYBODY ELSE, ESPECIALLY THEIR CLIENT, EDIT THEIR REPORTS. NO, IT'S REALLY BAD.
POD1000000044_S0000167	THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN BY A SOCIAL WORKER NAMED JOYCE.
POD1000000044_S0000169	ALVIN'S EDITS TO JOYCE'S REPORT MADE THE LANGUAGE MORE EMPHATIC. FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE JOYCE HAD WRITTEN THAT RACHEL WAS HESITANT WHEN IT CAME TO JUDY, ALVIN CHANGED IT TO SAY SHE WAS FEARFUL. IN ANOTHER SPOT,
POD1000000044_S0000170	HE ADDED THAT RACHEL WANTED TO BLOT OUT ANY MEMORY OF EVER HAVING BEEN AWAY FROM HIM.
POD1000000044_S0000171	HONESTLY, I MEAN, IT WAS HORRIFYING, YOU KNOW, JUST TO SEE THE DETAILED NOTES, TO SEE THE EDITED DRAFTS, THE CROSS OUTS, AND HIS HANDWRITING.
POD1000000044_S0000172	AND THEN THE FINAL VERSION THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COURTS WITH HIS EDITS IN THERE. LIKE, THERE'S NO QUESTION WHAT HAPPENED.
POD1000000044_S0000174	THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH A RECOMMENDATION, THE STRONGEST ONE OF ANY REPORT AND THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION OF ITS KIND.
POD1000000044_S0000175	SHE RECOMMENDED THAT I LIVE WITH HIM AND THAT MY BROTHER LIVE WITH MY MOM.
POD1000000044_S0000176	JOHN AND RACHEL'S SEPARATION CAME DOWN TO A DECISION DICTATED BY ALVIN AND SIGNED OFF ON BY JOYCE.
POD1000000044_S0000178	HOW WAS ALVIN ABLE TO EXERT THIS KIND OF POWER OVER A SOCIAL WORKER, SOMEONE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER? JOHN AND RACHEL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
POD1000000044_S0000179	BUT THAT NIGHT WHEN RACHEL GOOGLED JOYCE, SHE WAS SHOCKED TO REALIZE THAT JOYCE HADN'T BEEN AN IMPARTIAL OUTSIDER AT ALL. JOYCE WAS A FAMILY FRIEND.
POD1000000044_S0000181	RACHEL RECOGNIZED JOYCE AS THE KIND DARK HAIRED WOMAN WHOSE HOUSE SHE VISITED AS A CHILD.
POD1000000044_S0000182	RACHEL WOULD BRING HER CELLO OVER TO PLAY MUSIC WITH JOYCE AND HER FAMILY. WHICH MEANS THAT, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE WRONG WITH THE REPORT, JOYCE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THE PERSON TO WRITE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
POD1000000044_S0000183	SHE WAS LIKE THE ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE AS A KID WHO COULD HAVE SAID, HEY, I THINK YOU'RE COACHING HER AND THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
POD1000000044_S0000184	WHY ARE WE GONNA TRY AND SPLIT THESE KIDS UP?" SHE WAS THE ONE WHO COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.
POD1000000044_S0000185	IN 1970, JOYCE RECOMMENDED THAT MY SISTER GO WITH MY FATHER AND THAT I GO WITH MY MOTHER, AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
POD1000000044_S0000187	AND THAT DICTATED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE. WHAT HAPPENED?
POD1000000044_S0000189	THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN NAGGING AT JOHN AND RACHEL SINCE THEY FOUND THE REPORT. HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED? AND SO, JOHN AND RACHEL WANT TO FIND JOYCE AND ASK HER.
POD1000000044_S0000190	WHAT I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND, THOUGH, IS WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER. RACHEL AND JOHN ARE BOTH PRACTICING THERAPISTS THEMSELVES. THEY'RE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF POSING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS.
POD1000000044_S0000191	AND ALTHOUGH I PLAY A MENTAL HEALTH SEMI PROFESSIONAL SEMI CONVINCINGLY ON A PODCAST, I'M NOT ACTUALLY ONE AT ALL. WHAT CAN I DO?
POD1000000044_S0000192	WELL, SO I HAVE HAD TO ADVOCATE FOR MYSELF MY ENTIRE LIFE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE. AND NOBODY ADVOCATED FOR ME OR MY BROTHER.
POD1000000044_S0000193	AND SO, IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH THIS, IT WOULD BE A HEALING PIECE FOR ME THAT SOMEBODY ELSE ADVOCATED FOR ME.
POD1000000044_S0000195	AFTER THE BREAK, IN SEARCH OF JOYCE.

POD1000000044_S0000211	AND DURING THIS TIME, MY THOUGHTS KEEP RETURNING TO ALVIN AND THE VIDEO OF HIS SESSION WITH TED, THE MEEK, BUTTONED UP PATIENT.
POD1000000044_S0000212	TOUCH HER! TOUCH HER!
POD1000000044_S0000213	OH, JACK.
POD1000000044_S0000214	THROUGHOUT, ALVIN TRIES TO HELP TED RELEASE HIS BOTTLED UP FEELINGS.
POD1000000044_S0000215	I CAN DO THIS BETTER THAN YOU. WATCH ME.
POD1000000044_S0000216	OKAY.
POD1000000044_S0000217	READY?
POD1000000044_S0000218	OKAY, OKAY.
POD1000000044_S0000219	WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE ME RIGHT NOW? OVER MY CHEST, I'M HAVING ALL KINDS OF...
POD1000000044_S0000220	BUT WHAT FELT LIKE A BRAND OF EXTREME EMPATHY IN THE FIRST VIEWING, NOW FEELS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.
POD1000000044_S0000221	I'M DOING BETTER THAN YOU, HUH?
POD1000000044_S0000222	YEAH.
POD1000000044_S0000223	NOW IT FEELS AS THOUGH ALVIN IS SCRIPTING THE OUTCOME.
POD1000000044_S0000224	IF YOU WANT TO CRY, GO AHEAD. GO ON. IT'S OKAY. GO ON.
POD1000000044_S0000225	AT ONE POINT, ALVIN TELLS TED TO CRY.
POD1000000044_S0000226	TED, IT'S OKAY, GO AHEAD, CRY. GO ON, IT'S ALRIGHT.
POD1000000044_S0000227	TED IS NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO CRYING.
POD1000000044_S0000228	TED, YOU'RE STARTING TO CRY. GO AHEAD, LET YOURSELF, LET YOURSELF. GO ON, IT'S ALL RIGHT. GO ON, DO IT.
POD1000000044_S0000229	TED IS NOT STARTING TO CRY, BUT ALVIN INSISTS.
POD1000000044_S0000230	TED, YOU'RE ON THE VERGE OF CRYING.
POD1000000044_S0000232	NO, CRY, GO AHEAD.
POD1000000044_S0000233	AND THEN, A TEAR APPEARS IN THE CORNER OF TED'S EYE. IT ROLLS DOWN HIS CHEEK. IT'S AS THOUGH ALVIN HAS CONJURED IT INTO BEING THROUGH SHEER FORCE OF HIS OWN WILL.
POD1000000044_S0000234	GOOD FOR YOU, GOOD FOR YOU, GREAT, GREAT. OKAY, NOW...
POD1000000044_S0000236	THE VIDEO IS A PART OF A SERIES PRODUCED BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION INTENDED TO SHOWCASE PRESTIGIOUS PSYCHOLOGISTS IN SESSION. THE WAY THE SERIES WORKS IS THAT, FOR PRIVACY REASONS, THE PATIENTS ARE PORTRAYED BY ACTORS.
POD1000000044_S0000237	AS THE CREDITS ROLL, I LEARN THAT WHILE ALVIN THE THERAPIST IS ALVIN THE THERAPIST, TED THE PATIENT IS ACTUALLY BOB THE ACTOR.
POD1000000044_S0000238	IT WAS A QUICK SHOOT. THERE WASN'T A REHEARSAL PER SE. WE JUST KIND OF WENT IN AND IMPROVISED.
POD1000000044_S0000239	THIS IS BOB, AND PERFORMANCE WISE, BOB HAS DONE IT ALL.
POD1000000044_S0000240	JUGGLED SWORDS, CRACKED WHIPS, EATEN FIRE. I'VE DONE, FOR 10 YEARS I DID A STAGE HYPNOSIS SHOW.
POD1000000044_S0000241	BOB IS A REGULAR RENAISSANCE MAN, IN THAT HE ALSO WORKED AT A RENAISSANCE FAIR. WHEN BOB SHOWED UP TO FILM THAT DAY, HE WAS ASKED TO IMPROVISE SOME SORT OF MARITAL PROBLEM THAT ALVIN COULD HELP SOLVE BY BRINGING HIS METHOD TO BEAR.
POD1000000044_S0000242	I ASKED BOB IF HE FOUND ALVIN'S BEHAVIOR DOMINEERING, BUT BOB DOESN'T RECALL MUCH. THERE IS ONE THING, THOUGH, THAT BOB DOES STILL RECALL, EVEN 13 YEARS LATER. IT SEEMS BOB WASN'T ALVIN'S FIRST CHOICE OF PATIENT.
POD1000000044_S0000243	HE HAD HAD SOMEONE ELSE DO IT BEFORE, I THINK IT WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LADY, AND IT DIDN'T GO THE WAY IT NEEDED TO. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
POD1000000044_S0000244	MMM, CAN YOU ELABORATE?
POD1000000044_S0000245	HE SHOWED IT TO ME BRIEFLY.
POD1000000044_S0000246	BOB DESCRIBES THE VIDEO ALVIN SHOWED HIM BEFORE THEY STARTED FILMING THAT DAY. IN IT, THE SETUP WAS THE SAME AS IT WAS FOR BOB'S SHOOT. ALVIN WAS IN AN ARMCHAIR, HIS LEGS UP ON AN OTTOMAN. EXCEPT THIS TIME...
POD1000000044_S0000247	IN THE ARMCHAIR BESIDE HIM WAS THE ACTRESS. LIKE BOB, THE ACTRESS IN THE VIDEO HAD BEEN ASKED TO COME UP WITH A MARRIAGE PROBLEM. BUT IN DOING SO, THE ACTRESS WENT TO A DARKER PLACE THAN ALVIN ANTICIPATED, DESCRIBING A HUSBAND WHO WAS VICIOUS AND CRUEL.
POD1000000044_S0000248	NONETHELESS, ALVIN TRIED TO OFFER COUNSEL.
POD1000000044_S0000249	HE WAS SAYING THINGS LIKE, WHEN HE BEHAVES IN THIS WAY, CAN YOU BE PLAYFUL ABOUT IT? AND THE ACTOR SAID THINGS LIKE, WHEN HE CALLS ME NAMES, SUGGESTING THAT HE MIGHT BE IN SOME WAYS BORDERLINE, AT THE VERY LEAST, VERBALLY ABUSIVE.
POD1000000044_S0000250	IT SEEMED THERE WAS THE WAY THE ACTRESS WAS GIVEN TO TALKING ABOUT AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, AND THEN THERE WAS THE WAY THAT ALVIN PREFERRED HER TO TALK ABOUT ONE. AND SO, THE ACTRESS WAS REPLACED, AND BOB WAS SHOWN HER VIDEO, TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT ALVIN DID NOT WANT.
POD1000000044_S0000251	IT'S YOU KNOW, I GOT THE MESSAGE I GUESS
POD1000000044_S0000253	STILL NOT HAVING RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM JOYCE, I DECIDE TO MAIL A LETTER. AND JUST A FEW DAYS LATER, I FIND AN EMAIL IN MY INBOX. IN IT, JOYCE TELLS ME SHE'S NOT SURE HOW MUCH HELP SHE CAN BE.
POD1000000044_S0000254	SHE REMINDS ME THAT IT HAS BEEN 50 YEARS. BUT, SHE SAYS, SHE'S WILLING TO TRY. SHE CONCLUDES THE EMAIL BY SAYING, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU WISH. JOYCE.
POD1000000044_S0000256	HELLO!
POD1000000044_S0000257	HELLO.
POD1000000044_S0000258	I THINK YOUR SISTER'S HERE TOO.
POD1000000044_S0000260	HELLO.
POD1000000044_S0000261	THE LAST TIME JOHN AND RACHEL SAW JOYCE, THEY WERE CHILDREN.
POD1000000044_S0000262	THEY'RE NOW IN THEIR 50S AND 60S. BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC, THE MEETING BETWEEN RACHEL, JOHN, AND JOYCE WILL HAVE TO TAKE PLACE OVER ZOOM. JOHN AND RACHEL JOIN FIRST FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES.
POD1000000044_S0000263	SO HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING TODAY?
POD1000000044_S0000264	QUITE ANXIOUS ACTUALLY. WHAT ABOUT YOU, BROTHER JOHN?
POD1000000044_S0000265	I'M MORE NERVOUS THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD BE.
POD1000000044_S0000266	JOHN IS SEATED IN A CHAIR, HIS POSTURE UPRIGHT. RACHEL IS SITTING BACK ON A COUCH.
POD1000000044_S0000267	GO AHEAD AND TALK A LITTLE BIT. WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?
POD1000000044_S0000268	I HAD YOGURT AND BLUEBERRIES, YEAH.
POD1000000044_S0000269	ME TOO.
POD1000000044_S0000271	I CAN SEE THE JOYCE IS IN THE ZOOM WAITING ROOM, WAITING.
POD1000000044_S0000272	BACK IN MY DAY, A WAITING ROOM HAD ALL KINDS OF STUFF TO KEEP YOU OCCUPIED, LIKE LUKEWARM WATER YOU COULD DRINK FROM A PAPER CUP, OR A 20 YEAR OLD COPY OF VOGUE. BUT NOW WAITING ROOMS ARE SO... METAPHYSICAL. THERE'S NOTHING TO DO IN THEM.
POD1000000044_S0000273	I SUGGEST WE LET JOYCE IN.
POD1000000044_S0000274	OKAY.
POD1000000044_S0000275	YEAH, OKAY, YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
POD1000000044_S0000276	JOYCE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN WEARING A BRIGHT BLUE SWEATER AND A COLORFUL ASCOT THAT GIVES HER THE AFFECT OF A FUN GRANDMOTHER. STANDING BESIDE JOYCE IS A MIDDLE AGED MAN WHO I ASSUME IS HER SON. HE'S HELPING HER GET SET UP.
POD1000000044_S0000277	HELLO.
POD1000000044_S0000278	OH, HELLO.
POD1000000044_S0000280	JOYCE AND HER SON FROWN AT THE COMPUTER. IT SEEMS THEY'RE HAVING SOUND ISSUES. THERE'S A LONG MOMENT IN WHICH WE ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE. AND THEN...
POD1000000044_S0000282	JOYCE SETTLES INTO AN ARMCHAIR.
POD1000000044_S0000283	WELL, DO YOU ALL LOOK FAMILIAR TO EACH OTHER?
POD1000000044_S0000284	NO. WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. I'M RACHEL. HI JOYCE.
POD1000000044_S0000285	HI, RACHEL.
POD1000000044_S0000286	HI, I'M JOHN.
POD1000000044_S0000287	YOU'RE JOHN.
POD1000000044_S0000288	SO JOYCE, DO YOU, I KNOW JOHN AND RACHEL ARE CURIOUS ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH YOU REMEMBER, MAYBE
POD1000000044_S0000289	VIRTUALLY NOTHING.
POD1000000044_S0000291	SO I WASN'T CLEAR WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU. I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO TRY.
POD1000000044_S0000293	SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE REMEMBERING FROM THAT TIME OR WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT MY DAD AND MY MOM WERE IN A VERY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER, BITTER CUSTODY BATTLE.
POD1000000044_S0000294	AND THERE WERE SO MANY COURT BATTLES.
POD1000000044_S0000295	AND ONE OF THE REPORTS WAS DONE BY YOU, SO WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU REMEMBERED ABOUT THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000297	JOYCE INHALES THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH, SHAKES HER HEAD.
POD1000000044_S0000298	I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
POD1000000044_S0000300	WE WANT TO, WE THINK OUR FATHER INFLUENCED KIND OF EVERYBODY HE MET IN A VERY HEAVY HANDED WAY.
POD1000000044_S0000301	YES, I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000303	SAYING AL WAS HEAVY HANDED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
POD1000000044_S0000305	JOYCE'S HUSBAND AT THE TIME WAS A COLLEAGUE OF ALVIN'S. THAT'S HOW SHE FIRST CAME TO KNOW ALVIN. HE AND HER HUSBAND BOTH TAUGHT IN THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY'S PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT. JOYCE SAYS HER HUSBAND WOULD ALWAYS COME HOME WITH AL STORIES.
POD1000000044_S0000306	ACTING OUT AT MEETINGS AND SHOUTING OUT INAPPROPRIATE STUFF. SO HE WAS VERY CONTROLLING. HE TOOK CONTROL OF ANY SOCIAL SITUATION.
POD1000000044_S0000307	ONE PARTY AT MY HOUSE, HE WAS A GUEST ALONG WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT. AND HE JUST TOOK CONTROL OF THE WHOLE EVENING.
POD1000000044_S0000308	AND OF COURSE, THE MORE PEOPLE DRANK, THE MORE INTENSE IT GOT. I THINK THE FOCUS WAS ON PEOPLE'S DREAMS AND DREAM ANALYSIS.
POD1000000044_S0000309	FOR ALVIN, A FREUDIAN, THIS MEANT EXPLORING EACH PARTYGOER'S DREAM FOR HIDDEN SEXUAL DESIRES THAT HE, ALVIN, COULD THEN EXPOUND UPON. IN A ROOM FULL OF COLLEAGUES.
POD1000000044_S0000311	JOYCE RELATES THE ANECDOTE TO ILLUSTRATE THE KIND OF GUY ALVIN WAS. BUT JOHN HEARS SOMETHING ELSE IN THE STORY.
POD1000000044_S0000312	SO YOU ARE SOCIALIZED.
POD1000000044_S0000314	JOHN IS TRYING TO REMIND JOYCE THAT SHE WAS ALVIN'S FRIEND, THAT WRITING THE REPORT WASN'T APPROPRIATE. BUT THE IMPLICATION GOES OVER JOYCE'S HEAD.
POD1000000044_S0000315	THE DEPARTMENT WASN'T A BIG ONE, AND IT WAS CLOSE KNIT, AND EVERYBODY GOT TOGETHER.
POD1000000044_S0000316	YOU KNOW HIM?
POD1000000044_S0000317	FRIDAY, WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU HANG OUT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW BEST. AND THAT WAS IN THE DEPARTMENT.
POD1000000044_S0000319	WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS DID YOU HAVE THAT I CAN HELP WITH OR THAT I MIGHT ANSWER OR SPECULATE ABOUT?
POD1000000044_S0000321	YOU DON'T REMEMBER EVALUATING US. YOU DON'T REMEMBER HAVING THAT ROLE.
POD1000000044_S0000322	NO.
POD1000000044_S0000323	I GUESS I'M CURIOUS IF YOU REMEMBER, BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE SAID ALSO LIKE I WANT TO LIVE WITH MY DAD AND I LOVE LIVING HERE, BUT I WAS COACHED.
POD1000000044_S0000324	LIKE DON'T SMILE IF SOMEONE TAKES A PICTURE OF YOU WITH YOUR MOTHER.
POD1000000044_S0000325	OH, RACHEL. OH, RACHEL.
POD1000000044_S0000326	COULD YOU SEE THAT AT ALL?
POD1000000044_S0000327	NO, I, I, THIS IS ALL NEWS TO ME.
POD1000000044_S0000329	DID YOU DO OTHER CUSTODY EVALUATIONS? WAS THAT A PART OF YOUR PRACTICE?
POD1000000044_S0000330	THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST ONES. AND IT WAS AT HIS REQUEST THAT I DID THAT INITIALLY.
POD1000000044_S0000331	IT WAS AT AL'S REQUEST, YOU'RE SAYING.
POD1000000044_S0000332	OH YEAH, YEAH.
POD1000000044_S0000334	DO YOU REMEMBER ANY THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS THAT
POD1000000044_S0000336	YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO EVALUATE SOMEONE THAT I SOCIALIZE.
POD1000000044_S0000337	NO, NO, NOT REALLY, BECAUSE THIS WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF OUR ARRIVAL AND SO WE WEREN'T REALLY SOCIALIZING AT THAT POINT.
POD1000000044_S0000339	AT THAT POINT, JOYCE AND HER HUSBAND HAD JUST ARRIVED IN TOWN. WHILE HER HUSBAND TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY, JOYCE DID NOT. SHE HOPED TO SOMEDAY, BUT SHE WAS STILL FAIRLY YOUNG.
POD1000000044_S0000340	AND AT THE TIME, THE ONLY WOMEN IN THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT WERE GRAD STUDENTS AND SECRETARIES. SO WHEN ALVIN, THIS LARGER THAN LIFE FIGURE, CAME ASKING FOR A FAVOR, IT FELT HARD TO SAY NO.
POD1000000044_S0000341	HE WAS CHAIR OF THAT PROGRAM.
POD1000000044_S0000343	AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS NEW IN TOWN. I'M A PEOPLE PLEASER.
POD1000000044_S0000345	SO I THINK THAT THAT ADDED TO MY VULNERABILITY TO AL.
POD1000000044_S0000347	WELL, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT, UM,
POD1000000044_S0000349	YOUR REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT WE'RE SPLIT UP.
POD1000000044_S0000351	JOYCE TAKES OFF HER GLASSES, SHE PLACES THEM IN HER LAP.
POD1000000044_S0000352	OH, WOW.
POD1000000044_S0000354	I AM SORRY.
POD1000000044_S0000356	I NEVER.
POD1000000044_S0000358	WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000360	AND HEARING THAT I DID MAKES ME FEEL TERRIBLE.
POD1000000044_S0000362	SO THAT'S A SURPRISE TO YOU.
POD1000000044_S0000363	IT'S TOTAL SURPRISE AND IT'S TOTALLY.
POD1000000044_S0000365	AGAINST EVERYTHING I BELIEVE.
POD1000000044_S0000367	IT'S HORRIFYING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROMPTED IT OR WHAT PRECIPITATED IT.
POD1000000044_S0000369	I DON'T KNOW.
POD1000000044_S0000371	I'M SORRY.
POD1000000044_S0000373	BUT OF COURSE, THERE'S MORE.
POD1000000044_S0000374	WE CAN SEE AL CROSSING OUT WORDS AND PHRASES.
POD1000000044_S0000376	THAT YOU WROTE AND THEN REWRITING THEM IN STRONGER LANGUAGE.
POD1000000044_S0000378	AND THEN IT'S THAT STRONGER LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE FINAL REPORT.
POD1000000044_S0000380	I'M APPALLED BY THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000382	I HATE TO KEEP REPEATING MYSELF, BUT I AM TRULY SORRY THAT THAT HAPPENED AND HAD TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES.
POD1000000044_S0000384	I HAVE A STOMACHACHE. I FEEL TERRIBLE THAT IT TURNED OUT THAT WAY. I FEEL AWFUL THAT I HAD A PART IN THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000386	OR THAT I'M PERCEIVED TO HAVE HAD IT, WELL I DID. I MEAN, I CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T IF I WROTE IT.
POD1000000044_S0000388	THIS IS SOMETHING JOYCE DOES A FEW TIMES. SHE'LL START TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE, IF I DID THIS, BUT THEN SHE'LL CORRECT HERSELF. RACHEL HAS THE REPORT STANDING BY TO HOLD TO THE CAMERA SO JOYCE CAN SEE IT FOR HERSELF, SEE HER OWN SIGNATURE.
POD1000000044_S0000389	BUT THAT NEVER BECOMES NECESSARY. EVEN THOUGH SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER, JOYCE BELIEVES JOHN AND RACHEL. AND SO SHE DOESN'T COP OUT OR EQUIVOCATE.
POD1000000044_S0000391	IF I DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR BECAUSE I DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000393	I AM SO SORRY, YOU GUYS. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO MITIGATE IN SOME SMALL WAY.
POD1000000044_S0000395	AND IT MEANS A LOT THAT YOU SAY THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000396	OH YEAH, YEAH.
POD1000000044_S0000397	AND IT'S NOT JUST WORDS, IT'S HEARTFELT. IT'S REALLY HEARTFELT.
POD1000000044_S0000399	DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY HE MIGHT HAVE TURNED TO YOU?
POD1000000044_S0000400	WELL, TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME, I THINK.
POD1000000044_S0000402	
POD1000000044_S0000404	HE WAS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH WOMEN BECAUSE HE COULD PUSH THEM AROUND.
POD1000000044_S0000406	DID YOU FEEL USED?
POD1000000044_S0000408	BY HIM.
POD1000000044_S0000410	WELL, I GUESS HE WAS USING ME, SO YEAH.
POD1000000044_S0000412	JOYCE SAYS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH ALVIN WAS SHORT LIVED. THE END CAME SOON AFTER JOYCE INVITED ALVIN AND A FEW OF HIS PSYCHOLOGIST FRIENDS TO JOIN HER PRIVATE PRACTICE. THEY ACCEPTED AND ALL BEGAN WORKING OUT OF HER OFFICE.
POD1000000044_S0000413	AND WE DID THAT FOR A WHILE. AND THEN THEY DECIDED THAT IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER IN THE PRACTICE. SO THEY ASKED ME TO LEAVE.
POD1000000044_S0000414	AND IT WAS AT AL'S INSTIGATION.
POD1000000044_S0000416	WHAT HE SAID TO ME WAS, IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE INCOMPETENT.
POD1000000044_S0000417	IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMPETENT.
POD1000000044_S0000419	AND, YOU KNOW, FOR ME TO REMEMBER THIS 50 YEARS LATER, SAYS A LOT, DOESN'T IT?
POD1000000044_S0000421	SO THIS IS HIM KICKING YOU OUT OF THE PRACTICE.
POD1000000044_S0000422	MY
POD1000000044_S0000424	MY PRACTICE.
POD1000000044_S0000425	YOUR PRACTICE.
POD1000000044_S0000427	I REMEMBER YOU LIKE VERY, VERY, VERY FONDLY.
POD1000000044_S0000428	WELL, YOU'RE KIND.
POD1000000044_S0000429	YOU ARE A NICE LADY, YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON. AND I SEE THAT NOW TOO. I MEAN, I HAD EVERY REASON TO FEEL THAT WAY.
POD1000000044_S0000431	RACHEL WILL LATER TELL ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY HER DAD BRAINWASHED HER, SHE OFTEN CAN'T TRUST HER MEMORIES. SO IT FEELS GOOD THAT HER MEMORY OF JOYCE IS CORRECT. JOYCE IS NICE, BUT RACHEL IS NICE TOO, AND CAN SENSE HOW BADLY JOYCE IS FEELING.
POD1000000044_S0000432	YOU KNOW, I THINK MY DAD WAS SO CONTROLLING.
POD1000000044_S0000433	AND I HAVE TO THINK THAT MY DAD COERCED YOU AND REALLY PRESSURED YOU TO DO THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000435	THANK YOU.
POD1000000044_S0000437	YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY YOU CAN TELL RACHEL AND I ARE OKAY.
POD1000000044_S0000438	WE'RE REALLY GOOD PARENTS. WE'RE CLOSE TO OUR CHILDREN. WE DID NOT REPLICATE ANY OF THIS.
POD1000000044_S0000439	OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
POD1000000044_S0000440	AND I'VE BEEN WITH MY WIFE 37 YEARS, AND THANKFULLY NOW, YOU KNOW, RACHEL AND I CAME BACK TOGETHER ON OUR OWN, AND I'M VERY CLOSE WITH MY SISTER.
POD1000000044_S0000441	OH, I'M SO GLAD. I'M SO GLAD.
POD1000000044_S0000443	DAMAGE DONE TO US CAN OFTEN BECOME DAMAGE WE DO TO OTHERS. AND ON IT GOES. BUT WATCHING JOHN AND RACHEL, I'M STRUCK BY THE WAY THEY'RE BREAKING THAT CYCLE. NOT JUST IN THEIR LIVES, BUT RIGHT HERE IN THE ROOM.
POD1000000044_S0000444	WELL, THE ZOOM ROOM.
POD1000000044_S0000445	JUST TO BE CLEAR, JOYCE, I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
POD1000000044_S0000446	REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT OTHERS JUST OWN AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ROLE IN ANY DYNAMIC
POD1000000044_S0000447	IN ANY INTERACTION. IF THEY DO THAT, I'M GOOD. AND I'LL NEVER
POD1000000044_S0000449	I TRIED IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
POD1000000044_S0000450	HE WOULD NEVER OWN ANY CULPABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY, ANYTHING.
POD1000000044_S0000451	WHEN JOHN FIRST BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST, HE'D SEE ALVIN AT VARIOUS CONFERENCES WHERE ALVIN WAS RECEIVED AS A STAR.
POD1000000044_S0000452	FOR JOHN, IT ALWAYS OCCASIONED A WEIRD MIX OF PRIDE IN HIS FATHER'S CAREER AND BITTERNESS OVER HIS PERSONAL REJECTION.
POD1000000044_S0000453	AT ONE CONFERENCE, JOHN ATTENDED ALVIN'S LECTURE IN THE HOPE OF FORCING HIS FATHER TO TALK TO HIM.
POD1000000044_S0000454	ALVIN SAW JOHN IN THE AUDIENCE, BUT AFTERWARDS MADE HIM WAIT ON LINE ALONG WITH ALL HIS ADORING FANS. EVENTUALLY, JOHN GREW FRUSTRATED AND LEFT.
POD1000000044_S0000455	IT'S ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF MY LIFE HOW HE JUSTIFIED OR RATIONALIZED TO HIMSELF, YOU KNOW, HAVING A SON AND SUPPOSEDLY LOVING HIM.
POD1000000044_S0000456	AND THEN JUST CUTTING HIM OFF AND REJECTING HIM FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I CAN'T FATHOM THAT AT ALL.
POD1000000044_S0000458	THERE WAS AN EMAIL EXCHANGE OVER SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS WHERE I ENDEAVORED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, THAT LIFELONG QUESTION OF, YOU KNOW, WHY?
POD1000000044_S0000459	AND HE JUST KEPT TRYING TO SELL ME HIS BOOKS AND, YOU KNOW, IT BECAME THIS REFRAIN, HAVE YOU READ MY BOOK? HAVE YOU READ MY BOOK? AND I'D SAY, IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO READ YOUR BOOK,
POD1000000044_S0000460	SEND ME A COPY AND I WILL READ IT. NO, HE WANTS ME TO BUY A BOOK. HE WANTED ME TO BUY A BOOK.
POD1000000044_S0000462	IN HIS EMAILS TO JOHN, ALVIN WROTE THAT IT WAS A SOPHOMORIC MYTH THAT A PARENT SHOULD SEEK RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE'S CHILD. I DO NOT ACCEPT SILLY POP PSYCHOLOGY TRUISMS, HE WROTE.
POD1000000044_S0000463	NEAR THE END OF ALVIN'S LIFE, JOHN WANTED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO SEE HIS FATHER SO ALVIN COULD MEET HIS GRANDKIDS.
POD1000000044_S0000464	BUT RACHEL COUNSELED JOHN NOT TO GO. SHE SAID THAT ALVIN WOULD REFUSE TO SEE HIM AND WAS STILL SO FULL OF ANGER THAT HE MIGHT EVEN CALL THE POLICE.
POD1000000044_S0000465	AFTER HIS DEATH, ALVIN LEFT BEHIND A WILL WITH A SECTION LISTING THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO'D WRONGED HIM. EACH PERSON WAS TO RECEIVE A SINGLE DOLLAR. AMONG THEM WAS JOHN.
POD1000000044_S0000466	BACK WHEN I SPOKE TO AL'S DISCIPLE, HOWARD, HE TOLD ME THAT AL WAS BEDRIDDEN AT THE END OF HIS LIFE, YET HE WAS STILL FOCUSED ON HIS THERAPEUTIC METHOD.
POD1000000044_S0000467	JUST BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY, WHEN I VISITED HIM, HE SAID, HOWARD, I'M WORKING ON BECOMING MORE OF AN OPTIMAL PERSON. I'M JUST DOING IT NOW. AND HE WAS LIKE SO ENERGETIC.
POD1000000044_S0000468	AND DO YOU...
POD1000000044_S0000469	FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, I MEAN, DID HE ACHIEVE THAT KIND OF LIKE OPTIMAL PERSONHOOD?
POD1000000044_S0000471	SHE SAID HE HAD...
POD1000000044_S0000473	WHEN I RAISED THE SUBJECT OF ALVIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS KIDS, AND HOW THAT CONNECTED TO HIS OPTIMAL SELF, HOWARD SAYS HE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT. ALVIN DIDN'T BRING UP HIS KIDS MUCH.
POD1000000044_S0000474	THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT GOES ON SOMETIMES, GOOD AND BAD, AND YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS IN LIFE. WE LIVE AND WE ADJUST AND DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
POD1000000044_S0000475	BUT I DON'T THINK WHATEVER HAPPENS AT A CERTAIN POINT IN SOMEONE'S LIFE SHOULD DEFINE THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE AS A PERSON OVERALL.
POD1000000044_S0000477	CAN YOU COME BACK IN A LITTLE BIT, HONEY?
POD1000000044_S0000478	A LITTLE GIRL BARGES INTO JOYCE'S ROOM. SHE'S WEARING A LACY BLUE DRESS THAT'S EITHER A NIGHTGOWN OR A CINDERELLA COSTUME.
POD1000000044_S0000479	I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU.
POD1000000044_S0000480	THAT'S MY SIX YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER.
POD1000000044_S0000481	SHE'S CUTE, VERY CUTE.
POD1000000044_S0000483	WE'RE SHELTERING IN PLACE TOGETHER.
POD1000000044_S0000484	THAT'S NICE.
POD1000000044_S0000485	NICE.
POD1000000044_S0000487	I'M VERY LUCKY.
POD1000000044_S0000489	JOYCE, I'M SO APPRECIATIVE.
POD1000000044_S0000490	THANK YOU.
POD1000000044_S0000491	YEAH, THANK YOU.
POD1000000044_S0000493	ONE CAN BELIEVE ONE IS OPTIMAL JUST AS ONE CAN BELIEVE ONE IS FLUENT IN FRENCH, A TALENTED SINGER, A GOOD THERAPIST. BUT THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY KNOW IS THROUGH ONE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS, THE ONES WHO LOVE US, WHO GUIDE US.
POD1000000044_S0000494	WHO LET US KNOW WHEN WE WANDERED ASTRAY. FOR SOME, REALIZING YOUR OPTIMAL SELF DOES NOT OCCUR IN SPITE OF OTHER PEOPLE, BUT BECAUSE OF THEM.
POD1000000044_S0000496	MY SON IS GETTING MARRIED IN THE BACKYARD I'M LOOKING AT IN A FEW WEEKS.
POD1000000044_S0000498	THANK YOU. IT'LL BE A VERY SMALL SOCIALLY DISTANCE.

POD1000000045_S0000008	I WAS JUST TELLING YOU BEFORE WE STARTED RECORDING THAT EVEN AS I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER KIND OF LIKE AN OUTLINE, SOME IDEAS FOR OUR CONVERSATION, I WAS GETTING SO EXCITED.
POD1000000045_S0000009	BECAUSE I KNOW IF ANYBODY CAN FILL US IN, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO MAYBE HAVEN'T HAD THE BEST YEAR OF BOOKS AND READING, CAN FILL US IN ON SOME THINGS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED.

POD1000000045_S0000011	ME TOO. I HAD SO MUCH FUN LOOKING THROUGH MY LIST OF WHAT I'D READ THIS YEAR TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO BRING.

POD1000000045_S0000015	AND I HAVE A SEVEN YEAR OLD IN FIRST GRADE AND A THREE ABOUT TO BE FOUR YEAR OLD AND I JUST DECIDED TO HOMESCHOOL THEM THIS YEAR. I HAVE AN EDUCATION BACKGROUND. I TAUGHT FOURTH GRADE FOR SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS. AND SO.
POD1000000045_S0000016	I JUST DECIDED, YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE ANXIETY OF THE SCHOOLS GOING BACK AND FORTH AND WHATNOT. SO I DECIDED TO HOMESCHOOL. SO WE'RE TRYING THAT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR, WHICH IS INTERESTING.
POD1000000045_S0000017	OTHER THAN THAT, I DO A LOT OF READING AND I DO A LOT OF WRITING AND WE JUST START KIND OF GOING WITH THE FLOW OF LIFE.
POD1000000045_S0000018	I AM WITH YOU ON GOING WITH THE FLOW. ALL OF MY KIDS ARE, IT SEEMS LIKE ARE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.
POD1000000045_S0000019	OUR OLDEST TWO ARE STILL ENROLLED IN THEIR REGULAR SCHOOL AND THEY'RE DOING ALL VIRTUAL. THEY GOT TO GO BACK ON CAMPUS.
POD1000000045_S0000020	WE TRIED TO OPEN SCHOOLS IN OKLAHOMA CITY, THEY GOT TO GO BACK FOR TWO DAYS, TWO SINGLE DAYS.
POD1000000045_S0000021	WE HAD TO CLOSE DOWN AGAIN. THE TWINS, MEANWHILE, WHO ARE IN SECOND GRADE, I HAD PULLED THEM OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR BECAUSE I'M LIKE YOU. WITH THE YOUNGER KIDS, I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DO THE BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH.
POD1000000045_S0000022	SO I ALSO AM HOMESCHOOLING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT IS AN EXPERIENCE.

POD1000000045_S0000027	THIS IS ONE OF MY WORST YEARS OF READING EVER. I MEAN, I KNOW A LOT OF US MAYBE ARE IN THAT BOAT.
POD1000000045_S0000028	IT JUST HAS NOT BEEN SOMETHING I'VE BEEN ABLE TO CARVE OUT TIME FOR THIS YEAR IN THE MIDST OF, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE OTHER CRAZINESS.
POD1000000045_S0000029	SO KATIE HAS PICKED SOME REALLY COOL THINGS AND SO, WHETHER YOU ARE A PROLIFIC READER OR IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU'VE BEEN IN A LITTLE BIT OF A SLUMP. I PROMISE YOU KATIE HAS SOMETHING ON HER LIST THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE SO WE'RE GOING TO GET TO ALL OF THAT.

POD1000000045_S0000033	OKAY, SO MINE IS A BEAUTY PRODUCT AND IT'S A ALL BRIGHT C SERUM. SO IT'S A VITAMIN C SERUM FROM BEAUTY COUNTER. IT IS THE MOST CUTEST LITTLE YELLOW BOTTLE THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN.
POD1000000045_S0000034	AND THE LIQUID THAT COMES OUT IS ACTUALLY YELLOW BECAUSE IT HAS SOME TURMERIC IN IT. AND SO IT HAS THIS REALLY LIKE NICE EARTHY KIND OF SMELL, BUT IT'S A VITAMIN C SERUM. IT GOES JUST ON AFTER YOU CLEANSE AND TONE.
POD1000000045_S0000035	AND I SWEAR THIS MAKES MY FACE LOOK INSTANTLY BETTER. LIKE YOUR SKIN GOES FROM LIKE BORING TO LIKE BRIGHT AND PRETTY IN 30 SECONDS. SO IT'S MY FAVORITE PRODUCT OF ALL TIMES RIGHT NOW.

POD1000000045_S0000044	OKAY, PERFECT.
POD1000000045_S0000045	BEAUTY COUNTER IS TECHNICALLY AN MLM COMPANY, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO USE A CONSULTANT. SO YOU CAN JUST ORDER STRAIGHT FROM THEIR WEBSITE. AND I WILL SAY IT'S A LITTLE PRICEY, BUT YOU DON'T NEED MUCH. LIKE I'VE HAD THIS BOTTLE FOR PROBABLY SIX MONTHS.
POD1000000045_S0000046	AND I STILL HAVE A GOOD LITTLE BIT LEFT. SO IT'S JUST MY FAVORITE.

POD1000000045_S0000058	DOLLY PARTON WAS SUCH A SCEPTIC FIGURE. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW WHO DOLLY WAS.
POD1000000045_S0000059	SO HER MUSIC IS REALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S PART OF MY CHILDHOOD, IT'S PART OF MY GROWING UP YEARS. DOLLY PARTON'S AMERICA IS A FANTASTIC PODCAST THAT I THOUGHT I LOVED DOLLY BEFORE I LISTENED TO THAT.
POD1000000045_S0000060	OH MY GOSH, IT UNLOCKS LIKE WHO THIS WOMAN IS, HOW SHE CAME UP IN THE INDUSTRY, THE TOTAL FEMINIST ICON THAT SHE IS THAT I NEVER KNEW ALL THESE YEARS, YOU KNOW, UNDERNEATH ALL THE HAIR.
POD1000000045_S0000061	AND THE COSTUMES AND HER HUGE PERSONALITY. SHE HAS BEEN SO SCRAPPY. SHE'S SO SMART AS A BUSINESSWOMAN.
POD1000000045_S0000062	SHE'S AMAZING, BASICALLY. LIKE, I FEEL LIKE ALL OF US KNOW THAT, BUT I CANNOT SAY IT ENOUGH.

POD1000000045_S0000069	BUT DID YOU EXPECT MILEY CYRUS TO BE ON A CHRISTMAS ALBUM?
POD1000000045_S0000070	NO, THAT'S INTERESTING.
POD1000000045_S0000071	YEAH, IT REALLY IS. AND SHE ALSO HAS ANOTHER DUET WITH MILEY'S DAD, BILLY RAY ON HERE.

POD1000000045_S0000100	WHEN YOU GIVE A PAIR OF SUPER COMFORTABLE BOMBA SOCKS, YOU'RE NOT ONLY GIVING SOMEONE A GIFT THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE, YOU'RE ALSO DONATING A SPECIALLY DESIGNED PAIR TO SOMEONE IN NEED.
POD1000000045_S0000101	BECAUSE FOR EVERY PAIR OF SOCKS THAT BOMBA SELLS, THEY DONATE A PAIR TO SOMEONE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE U.S.
POD1000000045_S0000102	AND SINCE SOCKS ARE THE NUMBER ONE MOST REQUESTED CLOTHING ITEM IN HOMELESS SHELTERS, THE GENEROSITY OF GIVING BOMBAS WILL MAKE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT THIS HOLIDAY SEASON.

POD1000000045_S0000112	WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT, LIKE I SAID, KATIE DID PUBLISH HER FIRST BOOK THIS YEAR. IT'S A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ALL ABOUT THAT HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.
POD1000000045_S0000113	SO I DEFINITELY WANT YOU GUYS TO STICK AROUND FOR THAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION. I CANNOT WAIT, KATIE, FOR US TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT HAS BEEN LIKE RELEASING A BOOK IN THE YEAR 2020. I'M SURE THAT HAS BEEN AN EXPERIENCE TOO.
POD1000000045_S0000115	BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED IN BOOKS AND READING THIS YEAR, BUT I WANTED TO KIND OF BREAK IT DOWN INTO CATEGORIES.
POD1000000045_S0000116	BECAUSE WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO LISTEN EVERY WEEK. SO OF COURSE IN A GROUP THAT BIG, THERE'S GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN KINDS OF READERS. SO I THOUGHT, OKAY, LET'S THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CATEGORIES OF READERS.
POD1000000045_S0000117	BECAUSE I KNOW IF I TELL YOU A CATEGORY, I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON KATIE TO PICK OUT A BOOK FOR THAT READER. SO I PICKED OUT SEVEN CATEGORIES.
POD1000000045_S0000118	I'M GOING TO THROW THE CATEGORY AT YOU. YOU TELL US WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE A GOOD READ THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE PICKED UP RECENTLY AND SPEAKING OF PICKING IT UP RECENTLY.
POD1000000045_S0000119	I THOUGHT THE FIRST CATEGORY THAT WOULD BE FUN WOULD BE LIKE THE BUZZ BOOK READER. THIS IS THE READER WHO LOVES TO BE IN THE LOOP ON THE BOOKS THAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. WHETHER YOU HANG OUT IN LIKE A FACEBOOK GROUP THAT'S DEVOTED TO READING OR YOU JUST LIKE TO, YOU KNOW,
POD1000000045_S0000120	I WAS GOING TO SAY AT DINNER PARTIES, WHATEVER THOSE WERE.
POD1000000045_S0000122	IF YOU JUST LIKE TO CHAT WITH PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN READING AND YOU LIKE A GOOD BOOK THAT EVERYBODY'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT, KATIE, WHAT ARE SOME GOOD PICKS FOR OUR READERS WHO LOVE BUZZY BOOKS?
POD1000000045_S0000123	OKAY, SO THE FIRST ONE THAT CAME TO MIND FOR THIS CATEGORY I JUST READ IN SEPTEMBER, I THINK, AND IT IS CALLED THE INVISIBLE LIFE OF ADDIE LARUE.
POD1000000045_S0000124	I HAVE THAT. SORRY. I GOT SO EXCITED. I'VE BEEN INTERRUPTING YOU ALREADY. OKAY. GO AHEAD. YES.
POD1000000045_S0000126	THE AUTHOR IS V.E. SCHWAB. THIS BOOK HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE. IT WAS A BOOK OF THE MONTH PICK. THAT'S HOW I GOT IT. THE COVER IS GORGEOUS. IT'S BLACK. IT'S GOT THESE GOLD LETTERS. IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.
POD1000000045_S0000127	OKAY, YES, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I GOT IT AS MY BOOK OF THE MONTH PICK AND I HAVE YET TO OPEN IT. KATIE, SELL ME ON THIS BOOK.
POD1000000045_S0000129	SO BASIC SETUP IS ADELINE LARUE. SHE LIVES IN THE 1700S. SHE'S IN A FRENCH VILLAGE OUTSIDE THE CITY WITH HER PARENTS. SHE BASICALLY MAKES A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.
POD1000000045_S0000130	WHO SHE CALLS THE DARKNESS TO GET HER OUT OF THIS KIND OF STICKY SITUATION. BUT THE CATCH IS THAT SHE WILL LIVE BASICALLY FOREVER AND FREE
POD1000000045_S0000131	BUT THAT ANYTIME SOMEONE SEES HER, ONCE THEY TURN THEIR BACK ON HER, THEY TOTALLY FORGET SHE EVER EXISTED.
POD1000000045_S0000132	SO THE STORY BOUNCES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE 1700S AND THEN 2014, WHERE SOMEBODY REMEMBERS HER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER 300 YEARS OF LIFE.
POD1000000045_S0000133	SO THAT'S WHERE OUR STORY BOUNCES OFF FROM THERE. AND I JUST LOVED IT. THE WRITING IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. THE EXPERIENCES THAT SHE HAS, I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE THEY MAKE FOR SOME REALLY INTERESTING, YOU KNOW, MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE.
POD1000000045_S0000135	THEY FORGET HER IMMEDIATELY. AND SO I JUST REALLY LOVED IT. THERE'S A LOT OF ART AND LITERATURE AND WRITING KIND OF BUILT INTO THE STORY TOO THAT JUST, I LOVED IT.
POD1000000045_S0000136	OKAY, I FEEL SO PROUD OF MYSELF THAT EVEN IN A YEAR WHERE I'M NOT CONNECTED TO READING, I ACTUALLY PICKED A BOOK THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. SO THERE YOU GO. MAYBE OVER THE CHRISTMAS BREAK, I'LL HAVE A LITTLE TIME TO FINALLY CRACK IT OPEN AND READ IT.
POD1000000045_S0000137	YES, I'VE HEARD THE AUDIO IS VERY GOOD TOO. THAT IS NOT HOW I READ IT, BUT I'VE HEARD THAT IT IS VERY GOOD ON AUDIO AS WELL.
POD1000000045_S0000138	PERFECT, PERFECT. OKAY. DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER PICKS FOR THE BUSY.
POD1000000045_S0000140	ONE MORE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WAS UP FOR BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR ON GOODREADS AND THIS IS CALLED THE GIRL WITH THE LOUDING VOICE BY ABBY DURAY.
POD1000000045_S0000141	IT'S ALSO GOT A GORGEOUS COVER. THIS IS A DEBUT NOVEL, WHICH I WAS LIKE SHOCKED WHILE READING IT BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD. BUT THIS BOOK FOLLOWS 14 YEAR OLD ADUNI AND SHE IS A NIGERIAN GIRL.
POD1000000045_S0000142	LIVING ALSO IN LIKE THE COUNTRYSIDE AND HER FATHER SELLS HER INTO BASICALLY A MARRIAGE INTO THIS MAN'S THIRD WIFE AND ALL SHE WANTS TO DO IN HER LIFE IS LEARN AND READ AND BE NOT SOMEBODY'S WIFE OR MOTHER AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000143	SOMETHING KIND OF TRAGIC HAPPENS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD THAT FORCES HER TO LEAVE WHERE SHE IS AND SHE GOES TO THE CITY TO WORK TO BASICALLY BE AN INDENTURED SERVANT FOR THIS OTHER KIND OF WEALTHY FAMILY.
POD1000000045_S0000144	AND SO THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT, BUT IT IS SO GOOD. HER ENGLISH IS A LITTLE ROUGH IN THE BEGINNING. LIKE YOU CAN SEE THE TRANSFORMATION OF HER AS SHE LEARNS MORE, WHICH IS GREAT.
POD1000000045_S0000145	BUT IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT GETTING USED TO THE KIND OF DIALECT IN THE BEGINNING, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM WITH IT. I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT'S REALLY GOOD ON AUDIO IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO THAT.
POD1000000045_S0000146	OKAY, TELL ME THE NAME OF IT ONE MORE TIME.
POD1000000045_S0000147	IT'S CALLED THE GIRL WITH THE LOUDING VOICE BY ABBY DURAY.
POD1000000045_S0000148	OKAY, THOSE BOTH SOUND SO GOOD. AND YEAH, I LOVE HEARING THOSE PICKS THAT IT'S LIKE, THESE ARE THE BOOKS THAT ALL OF THE READERS WHO ARE IN THE KNOW, THIS IS WHAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT.
POD1000000045_S0000149	SO I THINK I MIGHT ACTUALLY MAYBE BE LIKE A SECRET.
POD1000000045_S0000151	OKAY, SO THE SECOND CATEGORY THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE FUN IS SOMETHING I THINK A LOT OF OUR AUSTIMS CAN MAYBE RELATE TO, AND THIS IS THE STUCK IN A SLUMP READER.
POD1000000045_S0000152	THIS IS A READER WHO USUALLY DOES LOVE TO READ, BUT 2020 HAS JUST LIKE ZAPPED THEIR ENERGY AND IT HAS ZAPPED THE FUN OUT OF READING.
POD1000000045_S0000153	SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A PICK OR TWO FOR PEOPLE WHO, AGAIN, THEY'RE USUALLY READERS, BUT THIS YEAR THEY JUST KIND OF GOT STUCK IN A LITTLE BIT OF A SLUMP. WHAT MIGHT SNAP US OUT OF A SLUMP?
POD1000000045_S0000154	SO WHEN ANYBODY ASKS ME WHEN THEY'RE IN A READING SLUMP WHAT THEY SHOULD DO, I USUALLY SAY TWO THINGS. I SAY PICK A FAVORITE REREAD, WHICH I CAN'T BRING TO THE SHOW BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO REREAD.
POD1000000045_S0000155	OR I SAY PICK A REALLY SWEET MIDDLE GRADE BOOK. AND I KNOW MIDDLE GRADE ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY, BUT I FEEL LIKE MIDDLE GRADE BOOKS ARE JUST SO HOPEFUL AND SWEET USUALLY.
POD1000000045_S0000156	AND THEY'RE REALLY EASY TO READ, LIKE THEY'RE REALLY FAST, SO YOU CAN GET THROUGH A STORY PRETTY QUICKLY. SO I'M GOING TO TELL ABOUT ONE MIDDLE GRADE BOOK THAT I LOVED AND THEN I'M ALSO JUST GOING TO THROW IN ANOTHER FUN ADULT BOOK JUST FOR IN CASE WE HAVE MIDDLE GRADE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOVE MIDDLE GRADE.
POD1000000045_S0000157	BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE MIDDLE GRADE BOOKS THIS YEAR WAS CALLED THE LONELY HEART OF MAYBELL LANE BY KATE O'SHAUGHNESSY. THIS WAS ALSO A DEBUT NOVEL.
POD1000000045_S0000158	MAYBEL IS 11 AND SHE'S ESTRANGED FROM HER FATHER WHO'S LIKE A RADIO DJ AND SHE WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO MEET HIM AND KIND OF HAVE HIM KNOW WHO SHE IS.
POD1000000045_S0000159	HER MOM LEAVES HER WITH THIS NEIGHBOR WOMAN WHILE SHE GOES TO SEARCH FOR A JOB. IT'S LIKE OVER THE SUMMER. AND THIS NEIGHBOR ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF HER TEACHERS FROM SCHOOL.
POD1000000045_S0000160	AND SO SHE KIND OF LIKE CONS THIS NEIGHBOR LADY TO TAKE HER TO A SINGING CONTEST WHERE HER FATHER WILL BE SO THAT SHE CAN MEET HER DAD.
POD1000000045_S0000161	AND THEN ANOTHER BOY FROM HER SCHOOL KIND OF ACCIDENTALLY TAGS ALONG. SO THEY GO ON THIS ROAD TRIP.
POD1000000045_S0000162	THEY HAVE THESE EXPERIENCES. IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE LIKE MAKE YOUR OWN FAMILY KIND OF SITUATIONS WHICH I LOVE A BOOK ABOUT LIKE A COME PIECEMEAL FAMILY.
POD1000000045_S0000164	YEAH.
POD1000000045_S0000166	THAT ONE WAS VERY SWEET. I LOVED THAT ONE.
POD1000000045_S0000167	YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU TELL US YOUR NEXT PICK, I HAVE TO SAY, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN WE GET TO YOUR BOOK, THAT I LOVE A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL. AND I THINK I REALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM, NOT EVEN NECESSARILY WHEN I WAS IN THOSE MIDDLE GRADES.
POD1000000045_S0000168	ALTHOUGH I DID CERTAINLY A LOT OF READING AT THE TIME, BUT WHEN I WAS WORKING ON MY, AS OF YET, INCOMPLETE MASTER'S IN LIBRARIES.
POD1000000045_S0000171	LIKE DECADES AGO, BUT I TOOK A COUPLE OF YOUNG ADULT LITERATURE CLASSES. AND SO HERE I WAS AS A YOUNG ADULT, YOU KNOW, I WAS IN MY EARLY 20S, AND I WAS ASSIGNED THESE MIDDLE GRADE NOVELS AND OH MY GOODNESS, YOU'RE SO RIGHT, THEY ARE USUALLY SO ENGAGING.
POD1000000045_S0000172	SO ENCHANTING THE ACTION PICKS UP FROM THE BEGINNING AGAIN BECAUSE IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A CLASSICAL YOU KNOW MIDDLE GRADE ACTUAL READER, YOU GOT TO GRAB THAT ATTENTION RIGHT AWAY. AND SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF LIKE
POD1000000045_S0000173	STORY SET UP AND YOU KNOW, IT REALLY GETS YOU RIGHT INTO THE ACTION AND THAT IS A PERFECT PICK FOR IF YOU'RE IN A READING SLUMP AND YOU JUST WANT TO PICK UP A BOOK AND JUST TAKE OFF WITH IT.
POD1000000045_S0000174	I LOVE THAT. SO I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE MIDDLE GRADE AND AGAIN WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. BUT WHAT'S ANOTHER PICK FOR THE STUCK IN A SLUMP READER?
POD1000000045_S0000175	OKAY, SO THIS ONE IS CALLED THE HOUSE IN THE CERULEAN SEA BY T.J. KLEIN. YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THIS COVER ALL OVER THE PLACE TOO BECAUSE IT'S BEEN VERY POPULAR THIS YEAR.
POD1000000045_S0000176	BUT IT STARTS OFF WITH THIS MAN NAMED LINUS BAKER AND HE WORKS FOR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND HE GETS SENT ON THIS KIND OF SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT TO THIS ISLAND. THERE'S AN ORPHANAGE ON AN ISLAND.
POD1000000045_S0000177	AND THERE'S THESE KIDS AND THEY ALL HAVE THESE WEIRD MAGICAL ABILITIES. SO, AND THEY'RE NOT THINGS THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY FAMILIAR WITH. AND ONE OF THE KIDS IS, IT'S KIND OF A SCARY SITUATION. SO HE'S A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.
POD1000000045_S0000178	HE TAKES HIS CAT WITH HIM, HE GOES TO THIS ISLAND, AND HE STAYS AT THE ORPHANAGE, AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE SENDING REPORTS BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY ABOUT THE ORPHANAGE AND THE MAN WHO RUNS THE ORPHANAGE.

POD1000000045_S0000189	OKAY, SO MY FAVORITE ONE THIS YEAR, HANDS DOWN, WAS CALLED THE BOOK OF LONGINGS BY SUE MONK KIDD.
POD1000000045_S0000190	AND THIS ONE CAN BE A LITTLE CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE IT FOLLOWS THE LIFE OF ANNA, WHO IS THE FICTIONAL WIFE OF JESUS.

POD1000000045_S0000194	I WAS LIKE, I KNOW SOMEBODY TOLD ME TO READ THIS BOOK THIS YEAR AND IT WAS YOU. OKAY, YES.

POD1000000045_S0000205	YES, I JUST HAVE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE POINTED ME IN THAT DIRECTION. SO I FEEL LIKE, YES, THE STARS ARE ALIGNING FOR ME TO PICK THAT ONE UP.
POD1000000045_S0000207	I WILL SAY, IF ANYBODY'S UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MAYBE LIKE THE CONTENT OF THIS, THERE'S A GREAT AUTHOR'S NOTE IN THE BACK WHERE SHE KIND OF EXPLAINS HOW SHE DID IT.
POD1000000045_S0000208	KATIE COBB ON CURRENTLY READING IS THE REASON I READ THIS BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SHE'S THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED READ THE AUTHOR'S NOTE FIRST TO SEE IF THAT'S GONNA KIND OF MAKE YOU FEEL IFFY ABOUT IT LIKE FAITH WISE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH IT AND I ENDED UP REALLY LOVING IT.

POD1000000045_S0000210	OKAY, SO I ALSO LOVED THIS TENDER LAND BY WILLIAM KENT KRUGER. THIS WAS TECHNICALLY PUBLISHED LAST YEAR, BUT I READ IT THIS YEAR, SO I'M GOING TO COUNT IT. I THINK IT WAS KIND OF LATER IN THE YEAR.
POD1000000045_S0000211	SO THIS ONE'S KIND OF LIKE AN ODYSSEY RETELLING, LIKE ODYSSEY MEETS HUCK FINN, IF YOU WILL.
POD1000000045_S0000212	INTERESTING. I LIKE THAT.
POD1000000045_S0000213	THE MAIN CHARACTER IS ODIE AND HIS BROTHER. THEY ARE AT ONE OF THOSE NATIVE AMERICAN BOARDING SCHOOLS. THEY ARE NOT NATIVE AMERICANS. I DON'T REMEMBER HOW THEY ENDED UP THERE, BUT THEY ARE AT THIS SCHOOL.
POD1000000045_S0000214	THEY HAVE A GOOD FRIEND AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL AND SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT MAKES THEM HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR SCHOOL. AND SO THEY ARE ON THIS JOURNEY TO SEARCH FOR ODIE AND HIS BROTHER'S AUNT WHO IS IN A DIFFERENT CITY.
POD1000000045_S0000215	AND THEY LIKE TAKE OFF DOWN THE RIVER IN A CANOE AND THEY MEET ALL THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE AND HAVE ALL THESE EXPERIENCES AND I JUST REALLY LOVED IT. THE SCENERY WAS GORGEOUS, THE STORYTELLING WAS GORGEOUS,

POD1000000045_S0000221	IF I'M READING A LOT DURING THE YEAR, I'M ALMOST ALWAYS READING A LOT OF NONFICTION. SO WE'RE TALKING MEMOIR OR BIOGRAPHY. I LOVE ESSAY COLLECTIONS.
POD1000000045_S0000222	ANYTHING WHERE IT'S JUST REALLY BEAUTIFUL TO READ AND IT'S ALSO A NONFICTION. I MEAN, I ALSO LOVE MY SHARE OF SELF HELP BOOKS AS WELL.
POD1000000045_S0000224	FOR THOSE OF US WHO GET INTO THE NONFICTION EVERY YEAR, KATIE, WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR PICKS IN THAT REALM?
POD1000000045_S0000225	ONE OF THE BEST ONES I READ THIS YEAR WAS CALLED AFTER THE LAST BORDER, TWO FAMILIES AND THE STORY OF REFUGE IN AMERICA.
POD1000000045_S0000226	THIS ONE IS INCREDIBLE. SHE'S A JOURNALIST AND WRITER WHO WORKS CLOSELY WITH REFUGEES THAT LIVE IN AUSTIN, TEXAS. AND SHE WORKED REALLY CLOSELY WITH THESE TWO WOMEN.
POD1000000045_S0000227	THE FIRST ONE IS NAMED MUNA AND SHE'S FROM MYANMAR AND HER FAMILY CAME WITH HER TO AUSTIN. THAT WAS IN THE EARLY 2000S AND THEN HASNA CAME FROM SYRIA WITH HER FAMILY
POD1000000045_S0000228	MORE RECENTLY. AND SO SHE TELLS THESE STORIES OF THESE WOMEN KIND OF IN A CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF WHERE THEY WERE, HOW THEY CAME TO GET HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR FAMILIES ALONG THE WAY.
POD1000000045_S0000229	AND THEN SHE INTERSPERSES IT WITH MORE INFORMATIONAL CHAPTERS ABOUT THE U.S. IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE POLICY, WHICH I FOUND VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE I KNEW A LOT ABOUT THIS.
POD1000000045_S0000230	IT'S ONE OF THOSE TOPICS THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IT READ LIKE A NOVEL FOR ME. I COULD NOT WAIT TO SIT DOWN AGAIN AND PICK UP THESE WOMEN'S STORIES.
POD1000000045_S0000231	YOU KNOW, THEIR RESILIENCE AND THEIR COURAGE AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY GOOD. I WANT EVERYONE TO READ IT.
POD1000000045_S0000232	I HAVE HAD THAT ON MY LIST SINCE THE FIRST DAY I EVEN HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY PUBLISHED. OBVIOUSLY, REFUGEE ISSUES AND REFUGEE POLICY IN AMERICA IS CLOSE TO MY HEART. WE DID A WHOLE EPISODE ON THAT WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF 2017.
POD1000000045_S0000233	WHEN I WAS JUST RESEARCHING FOR THAT EPISODE, WHICH WE HAD TO DO A REALLY QUICK TURNAROUND ON THAT, I LEARNED SO MUCH. I WAS LIKE, OH MY GOSH, I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT ANY OF THIS.
POD1000000045_S0000234	SO I HAVE HAD THIS BOOK ON MY LIST FOR SO LONG. I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT UP BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO DIG INTO THAT ONE VERY SOON AFTER THE LAST BORDER.
POD1000000045_S0000235	ANOTHER ONE FOR NONFICTION AND THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER. IT'S NOT AS INFORMATION HEAVY, BUT THIS ONE'S CALLED NATIVE AND IT'S BY CAITLIN B. CURTIS.
POD1000000045_S0000236	AND SHE'S A CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND SHE'S ALSO A MEMBER OF THE POTAWATOMI NATION. AND SHE KIND OF JUST HAS A LOT OF REFLECTIONS ON HER CHRISTIAN FAITH AND HOW THAT INTERSECTS WITH HER NATIVE ROOTS.
POD1000000045_S0000237	AND GETTING BACK TO THOSE, YOU KNOW, STORIES AND JUST HER HERITAGE AND THEN HOW THAT KIND OF AFFECTS HER CHRISTIAN FAITH AS SHE GOES THROUGH IT. I LOVE EVERYTHING SHE TALKED ABOUT. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE CHURCH. SHE TALKED ABOUT RACIAL ISSUES IN THE CHURCH AND
POD1000000045_S0000238	YOU KNOW, INCLUSION AND WHITE SUPREMACY AND ALSO JUST LIKE HER LOVE FOR JESUS AND HER LOVE FOR NATURE AND ALL THE THINGS. AND I REALLY LIKED THAT ONE TOO.
POD1000000045_S0000239	YES, OH MY GOODNESS, THAT SOUNDS SO INTRIGUING TO ME AND AGAIN OF COURSE GROWING UP IN OKLAHOMA
POD1000000045_S0000240	THERE'S THIS REALLY STRONG INTERSECTION OF, YOU KNOW, LIKE SORT OF STANDARD AMERICAN CULTURE, THEN ALSO LIVING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE AND THE DIFFERENT NATIONS THAT
POD1000000045_S0000241	WERE MOVED TO OKLAHOMA, LIKE I JUST HAVE THIS SORT OF FAMILIARITY WITH IT, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO LIKE REALLY HAVE DONE LIKE A DEEP DIVE INTO HOW THAT ALL FITS TOGETHER WITH CHRISTIANITY, ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANITY IN AMERICA. SO
POD1000000045_S0000242	THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC. I LOVE THAT.
POD1000000045_S0000243	YEAH, IT WAS REALLY GOOD. I LISTENED ON AUDIO AND SHE READS IT, SO IT'S REALLY NICE TO HEAR HER VOICE, YOU KNOW, TELL YOU HER STORY AND I REALLY LIKE THAT.
POD1000000045_S0000244	YES, FANTASTIC. OKAY, NEXT CATEGORY. LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A TURN INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE FLUFFIER MAYBE BECAUSE CATEGORY NUMBER FIVE, I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN TO TALK ABOUT THE BEACH READER.
POD1000000045_S0000245	SINCE MOST OF US MISSED OUR SUMMER VACATIONS THIS YEAR, AND THAT MIGHT BE WHEN WE PICK UP A LIGHTER READ TO CHECK OUT, MAYBE TO TAKE TO THE BEACH OR WHEREVER WE'RE TRAVELING,
POD1000000045_S0000246	KATIE, WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE MORE LIKE BEACHY READS THAT WE MISSED OUT ON THIS YEAR?
POD1000000045_S0000247	OKAY, SO I DON'T READ A TON IN THIS CATEGORY, BUT MY FIRST ONE IS CALLED BEACH READ BY EMILY HENRY. AND THIS ONE, THE TITLE'S A LITTLE MISLEADING BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE AT A LAKE, BUT
POD1000000045_S0000248	THE SETUP IS THAT JANUARY IS A ROMANCE WRITER. SHE'S IN A WRITING SLUMP. SHE GOES TO STAY AT HER FATHER'S LAKE HOUSE AFTER HE DIES. AND THEN NEXT DOOR IS ACTUALLY HER COLLEGE WRITING AUTHOR NEMESIS NAMED GUS.
POD1000000045_S0000249	AND HE'S ALSO HAVING SOME WRITER'S BLOCK. SO THEY KIND OF MAKE THIS BET THAT SHE'S GONNA WRITE LIKE THE NEXT AMERICAN NOVEL. HE'S GONNA WRITE A ROM COM AND THEY'RE GONNA LIKE FLIP BACK AND FORTH AND SHARE NOTES AND YOU KNOW.
POD1000000045_S0000250	IT'S CUTE AND FUN AND SEXY, BUT THERE'S ALSO LIKE A DEPTH TO IT. I DON'T LOVE LIKE JUST THE FLUFF BECAUSE THERE IS SOME GRIEF AND THERE'S SOME, YOU KNOW, BETRAYAL AND SOME KIND OF THINGS THAT GO INTO IT.
POD1000000045_S0000251	THAT GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF LIKE DEPTH TO THE CUTE, FUN ROMANCE PART. SO I REALLY LIKED THAT ONE. I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN.
POD1000000045_S0000252	YES, BEACH READ IS ONE THAT I ACTUALLY DID READ THIS YEAR AND IT IS SO GOOD. IT'S JUST WHAT YOU EXACTLY SAID. IT'S SO FUN. I FEEL LIKE THE DIALOGUE AND THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN JANUARY AND GUS, IT'S LIKE SO SNAPPY AND SO GOOD.
POD1000000045_S0000253	SO FUNNY, BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THERE IS SO MUCH DEPTH TO EACH OF THEIR BACKSTORIES, WHAT THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH, WHAT THEY'RE PROCESSING. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT ONE. I THINK EMILY HENRY IS A GREAT WRITER. SO, YAY, I LOVE THAT ONE.
POD1000000045_S0000254	OKAY, ANOTHER ONE THAT I LIKED THIS YEAR IS CALLED THE HAPPY EVER AFTER PLAYLIST BY ABBY JIMENEZ. THIS ONE, IT'S LIKE A COMPANION NOVEL TO HER FIRST ONE, WHICH I DON'T REMEMBER THE TITLE NOW, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE FIRST ONE. SO YOU CAN PICK THIS ONE UP BY ITSELF.
POD1000000045_S0000255	SO SLOANE IS OUR MAIN CHARACTER. SHE'S AN ARTIST. HER LIFE IS KIND OF FALLING APART. AND THIS DOG LIKE JUMPS INTO HER CAR ONE DAY AND SHE HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHOSE DOG THIS IS AND WHAT'S GOING ON.
POD1000000045_S0000256	AND SO SHE FINDS THE OWNER OF THE DOG AND HE'S ACTUALLY OVERSEAS FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. SO SHE AGREES TO TAKE CARE OF THE DOG, THEY COMMUNICATE FIRST LIKE ON TEXT,
POD1000000045_S0000257	AND THEN SHE FINDS OUT WHO THIS GUY IS AND HE'S PRETTY FAMOUS. AND SO SHE'S LIKE, I'M TALKING TO THIS FAMOUS GUY AND TAKING CARE OF HIS DOG.
POD1000000045_S0000258	AND SO THEIR RELATIONSHIP KIND OF STARTS OVER TEXT AND THEN THEY MEET AND YOU KNOW, ETC, ETC. SO I THOUGHT THIS ONE IS REALLY FUN. IT'S REALLY EASY TO READ. THERE'S LOTS OF FUN MUSIC.
POD1000000045_S0000260	YES.
POD1000000045_S0000261	SO CUTE AND FUN AND SEXY.
POD1000000045_S0000262	I MEAN, IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE ME A MEET CUTE THAT INVOLVES A DOG AND YOU'RE TELLING ME MUSIC IS INTERWOVEN IN THE STORY, I'M LIKE, WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD CRITTER FOR ME. SO I COULD DEFINITELY PICK THAT ONE UP TOO.
POD1000000045_S0000263	OKAY, NEXT CATEGORY IS THE EXPAND MY VIEWS READER. SO THIS IS THE READER WHO LOVES TO READ ABOUT EXPERIENCES OF OTHER PEOPLE.
POD1000000045_S0000264	KIND OF OUTSIDE THEIR OWN CONTEXT, WHETHER IT'S OUTSIDE OF MAYBE THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUND.
POD1000000045_S0000265	THE READER WHO REALLY TAKES UP THE PROMISE THAT READING GIVES US THAT YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT LIKE ANYTHING, ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN LEARN PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES, YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES.
POD1000000045_S0000266	IF YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE WHEN YOU'RE READING. SO WHAT ARE SOME EXPAND MY VIEWS PICKS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR US, KATIE?
POD1000000045_S0000267	I WILL BE SHARING MY SCREEN.
POD1000000045_S0000268	SHE IS ON INSTAGRAM AT SITTING PRETTY AND I LOVE HER INSTAGRAM PROFILE AND ALL OF HER CONTENT. SO SHE'S, THIS IS KIND OF LIKE A MEMOIR ESSAY COLLECTION.
POD1000000045_S0000269	ABOUT A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN IN A WHEELCHAIR MOST OF HER LIFE. SO SHE TALKS ABOUT THINGS LIKE DATING.
POD1000000045_S0000270	AND WORKING AND HER FAMILY LIFE AND HOW SHE WAS TREATED AS A CHILD AND HOW PEOPLE TREAT HER IN PUBLIC AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO HELP HER TOO MUCH WHEN SHE DOESN'T WANT HELP.
POD1000000045_S0000271	SO SHE BRINGS UP A LOT OF IMPORTANT ISSUES ABOUT ABLEISM AND HOW SHE FEELS IN HER BODY. SHE'S REALLY FUNNY AND GRACIOUS AND I JUST REALLY LIKED IT.
POD1000000045_S0000272	I DID THIS ONE ON AUDIO WHICH SHE ALSO READS AND SO JUST HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE OF HER TELLING YOU ABOUT HER LIFE, THIS IS A REALLY, REALLY GOOD ONE.
POD1000000045_S0000273	OKAY, YES, I HAVE SEEN HER INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT IT HAS REALLY
POD1000000045_S0000274	RESONATED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE. I MEAN, TALK ABOUT EXPANDING YOUR VIEWS AND HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMEBODY ELSE'S PERSPECTIVE THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM YOUR OWN. AND SO I BET THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AN INCREDIBLE READ.
POD1000000045_S0000275	AND THEN I ALSO, FOR THIS CATEGORY, WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I TALK ABOUT CAST BY ISABEL WILKERSON. THIS IS ONE YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN EVERYWHERE TOO. IT'S BIG, BUT ISABEL WILKERSON IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT WOMEN I'VE EVER READ IN MY LIFE.
POD1000000045_S0000277	SHE TOOK 10 YEARS TO RESEARCH AND WRITE THIS BOOK.
POD1000000045_S0000278	WOW. OH MY GOSH. OKAY.
POD1000000045_S0000279	HER BASIC PREMISE IS THAT THE WAY THE UNITED STATES HAS SEPARATED ITSELF OUT BY RACE, SHE CALLS IT A CASTE SYSTEM AND SHE KIND OF COMPARES IT TO INDIA'S CASTE SYSTEM AND ALSO NAZI GERMANY'S CASTE SYSTEM.
POD1000000045_S0000280	SHE BRINGS IN SIMILARITIES AND ALSO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AND THEN SHE TALKS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF RACISM IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW IT HAS EVOLVED FROM SLAVERY TO MASS INCARCERATION AND THEN NOW TO WHERE WE ARE WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES
POD1000000045_S0000281	SURROUNDING RACE IN THE COUNTRY NOW. SO I REALLY LOVED READING THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS REALLY HARD. I READ IT WITH A BUDDY, WHICH WAS GOOD BECAUSE WE HAD TO KIND OF PROCESS AFTER EACH DAY.
POD1000000045_S0000282	BUT IT'S VERY READABLE. IT'S NOT LIKE A TEXTBOOK. SHE WRITES IN A REALLY LIKE NARRATIVE Y KIND OF WAY. SHE TELLS ALL THESE STORIES OF PEOPLE YOU'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT. LIKE, WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD THIS BEFORE?
POD1000000045_S0000283	AND SO I JUST REALLY LIKED THAT ONE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY LIKE MIND OPENING KIND OF BOOK. SO I WANTED TO.
POD1000000045_S0000285	AND WHAT A PERFECT TREE TO PICK UP IN 2020 AS THIS HAS COME TO THE SURFACE NATIONALLY AND COLLECTIVELY FOR US AGAIN. THAT'S A GREAT PICK FOR THIS YEAR FOR SURE.
POD1000000045_S0000286	SO, OKAY, LAST CATEGORY BEFORE I REALLY TURN THE MIC OVER TO YOU TO TALK ABOUT YOUR BOOK AND YOUR PUBLISHING JOURNEY. BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE RELUCTANT READER. NOW.
POD1000000045_S0000287	A LOT OF US WHO ARE PARENTS MAYBE ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PHRASE BECAUSE MAYBE WE HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE RELUCTANT READERS. THEY CAN READ, BUT THEY JUST THEY'RE REALLY RESISTANT TO IT.
POD1000000045_S0000288	HEY, SOME OF US SAID IT'S STILL THE CASE IN ADULTHOOD. SOME OF US WOULD MAYBE RATHER JUST TURN ON NETFLIX AND SEE WHAT'S ON INSTEAD OF READING. I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A FEW PICKS FOR A READER THAT THEY COULD JUST PICK UP AND NOT BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN.
POD1000000045_S0000289	SURE. SO WHEN I WAS TEACHING FOURTH GRADE, WHEN I HAD RELUCTANT READERS, MY GO TO WAS LIKE TO HAND THEM A GRAPHIC NOVEL BECAUSE GRAPHIC NOVELS ARE SO FUN AND I REALLY LOVE THEM AS AN ADULT TOO. I LOVE TO LOOK THROUGH THE PICTURES AND READ THE STORY.
POD1000000045_S0000290	SO MY FAVORITE GRAPHIC NOVEL OF THIS YEAR IS CALLED WHEN STARS ARE SCATTERED AND IT'S WRITTEN BY OMAR MOHAMED AND VICTORIA JAMISON. IT'S A TRUE STORY OF OMAR AND HIS BROTHER HASSAN AND THEY LIVE IN A REFUGEE CAMP IN KENYA.
POD1000000045_S0000291	AND SO IT KIND OF TELLS YOU ABOUT THEIR OVERALL DAILY LIFE AND THEN THEIR PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH THE UN AND THEN COMING TO AMERICA.
POD1000000045_S0000292	BUT HIS BROTHER IS A PERSON WITH DISABILITIES, AND SO HE FEELS LIKE HE HAS TO JUST TAKE CARE OF HIS BROTHER ALL THE TIME.
POD1000000045_S0000293	AND SO IT'S A VERY SWEET STORY ABOUT BROTHERS. IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT REFUGEES AND THE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. AND THEN IT'S REALLY HOPEFUL.
POD1000000045_S0000294	BECAUSE IT'S MIDDLE GRADE AND YOU HAVE TO BE HOPEFUL IN MIDDLE GRADE. SO I LOVED IT. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE AND THE STORY ARE JUST SO COMPELLING. I SAT DOWN AND READ THE ENTIRE THING AND IT WAS SO GOOD.
POD1000000045_S0000295	SOUNDS FANTASTIC. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.
POD1000000045_S0000296	OKAY, BUT IF GRAPHIC NOVELS AREN'T YOUR THING, SOMETHING THAT I LOVE TO DO WHEN I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO READ, I PICK UP A YA FANTASY BECAUSE YA FANTASIES ARE SO FUN AND THEY USUALLY HAVE A SERIES TO GO WITH THEM AND YOU CAN READ LIKE FIVE IN A ROW.
POD1000000045_S0000297	THIS ONE ONLY HAS TWO AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A FANTASY BUT IT'S AN ALTERNATE HISTORY. SO THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED DREAD NATION AND THE AUTHOR IS JUSTINA IRELAND.
POD1000000045_S0000298	SO THE ALTERNATE HISTORY IS THAT THE CIVIL WAR HAD TO PAUSE BECAUSE ZOMBIES, YES, ZOMBIES WERE TAKING OVER.
POD1000000045_S0000299	AND SO THEY TOOK ALL THESE FORMER SLAVES AND CHILDREN AND PUT THEM IN THESE TRAINING SCHOOLS TO BASICALLY KILL THE ZOMBIES. THAT'S THEIR NEW JOB.
POD1000000045_S0000300	SO WE HAVE JANE MCKEAN IS OUR MAIN CHARACTER. SHE IS SNARKY AND SPICY AND STRONG. SHE'S JUST LIKE ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH BECAUSE SHE'S GREAT.
POD1000000045_S0000301	SHE AND OTHERS FROM HER TRAINING SCHOOL GET SENT TO THIS SETTLEMENT OUT WEST AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CREEPY SITUATION. THEY GET THERE AND THEY'RE LIKE, YEAH, THINGS ARE NOT ALL AS THEY SEEM HERE.
POD1000000045_S0000302	AND SO THE ADVENTURE KIND OF TAKES OFF FROM THERE. NOW, IF YOU HAD ASKED ME BEFORE READING THIS IF I LIKED ZOMBIE BOOKS, I WOULD HAVE SAID NO.
POD1000000045_S0000303	BUT I LISTENED TO THIS ONE ON AUDIO AND BONNIE TURPIN READS IT AND SHE'S LIKE THE QUEEN OF AUDIO BOOKS IN MY OPINION. I LOVE HER.
POD1000000045_S0000304	AND I JUST GOT PULLED IN RIGHT AWAY, LISTENED TO THE SECOND ONE AS SOON AS I COULD GET MY HANDS ON IT. THE SEQUEL IS JUST AS GOOD AND IT CAME OUT THIS YEAR AND THAT ONE'S CALLED THE DEATHLESS DIVIDE.
POD1000000045_S0000305	AND SO THERE'S JUST TONS OF ACTION, TONS OF ZOMBIES. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME FRIENDSHIP SITUATIONS AND THINGS. IT WAS REALLY FUN AND I WAS SURPRISED THAT I LIKED IT, BUT I REALLY, REALLY LOVED IT, SO.
POD1000000045_S0000306	I MEAN, ISN'T THAT JUST LIKE THE MAGIC OF BOOKS? THAT A BOOK EXISTS THAT IMAGINES A WORLD?
POD1000000045_S0000307	WHERE IT'S THE CIVIL WAR AND ALSO ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.
POD1000000045_S0000309	I LOVE IT. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WHAT A GREAT PICK THAT IS. AND I THINK YOU'RE SO RIGHT TOO. I DO A LOT, A LOT, A LOT OF READING VIA AUDIO BOOK.
POD1000000045_S0000310	NOT ALL OF IT, BUT A LOT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, ANYONE THAT IS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO READ, BUT YOU ARE STILL DOING YOUR DAILY WALKS WITH YOUR DOG.
POD1000000045_S0000311	OR YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ON THE TREADMILL EVERY NOW AND AGAIN, OR LIKE ANYTIME WHERE YOU HAVE A LITTLE SPACE THAT YOU CAN FILL IT IN WITH AUDIO, AFTER YOU LISTEN TO SORT OF AWESOME, YOU COULD PUT ON AN AUDIO BOOK AND GET SOME READING DONE.
POD1000000045_S0000312	I DON'T THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE PUT ENOUGH EMPHASIS IN THEIR LIVES ON THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TOTALLY READ BOOKS VIA AUDIO. THAT'S A VERY LEGITIMATE WAY TO READ.
POD1000000045_S0000313	WELL, AND I WAS LIKE VERY ANTI AUDIOBOOK UNTIL LIKE THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR BECAUSE I HADN'T REALLY TRIED ONE. I WAS LIKE, LISTEN, I'M GOING TO GET BORED. LIKE I'M GOING TO NOT FOCUS. AGAIN, IT WAS KATIE.
POD1000000045_S0000314	CURRENTLY READING WHO IS LIKE, I'M SAD FOR YOU THAT YOU DON'T LIKE AUDIOBOOKS. AND I WAS LIKE, FINE, I'LL TRY ONE. AND I HAVE PROBABLY LISTENED TO MORE AUDIOBOOKS THIS YEAR THAN I HAVE DONE ANY
POD1000000045_S0000316	I LOVE IT. YES.
POD1000000045_S0000317	I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT YOU CAN TURN THE SPEED UP, WHICH I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW IF YOU'RE JUST LIKE AUDIOBOOK NEWBIES, YOU CAN TURN THE SPEED UP BECAUSE THEY READ VERY SLOWLY.
POD1000000045_S0000318	I HAVE GOTTEN MYSELF TO WHERE I CAN LISTEN AT A PRETTY FAST RATE AND STILL UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE SAYING. AND THAT'S BEEN REALLY HOW I CONSUME A LOT OF BOOKS.
POD1000000045_S0000319	AND I THINK, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT I THINK KATIE COBB, AGAIN, ON CURRENTLY READING PODCAST, HAS EVEN SAID THAT'S HOW SHE GETS THROUGH SO MANY BOOKS, IS IF YOU LISTEN ON AUDIO AND IF YOU JUST, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CRANK IT UP LIKE CRAZY FAST. IF YOU JUST KNOCK THE SPEED UP JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT,
POD1000000045_S0000320	YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT HOW MUCH MORE QUICKLY YOU CAN GET THROUGH A BOOK. AND AGAIN, SINCE I DO A LOT OF READING THAT'S NONFICTION, I HAVE NO ISSUES AT ALL WITH JUST BUMPING THAT SPEED UP BECAUSE I JUST KIND OF WANT TO GET THROUGH WHATEVER IT IS.
POD1000000045_S0000321	YEAH, SO GREAT. SO THOSE ARE KATIE. OH MY GOSH, WHAT A LIST YOU HAVE GIVEN US. THAT IS A HUGE GIFT JUST IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. YOU GUYS, KATIE IS GIVING US THIS GIFT.

POD1000000045_S0000334	DID YOU KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE WOMAN USES 12 PRODUCTS WITH 168 INGREDIENTS IN HER SKINCARE REGIME EVERY DAY? UNFORTUNATELY, AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF THOSE INGREDIENTS ARE TOXINS.
POD1000000045_S0000335	VERY NOT AWESOME, BUT TRUE BOTANICALS' SKIN AND BODY PRODUCTS ARE FILLED WITH NATURAL AND ORGANIC INGREDIENTS AND THEY DELIVER RESULTS WITHOUT TOXINS SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD WHILE YOU'RE WORKING FROM HOME.

POD1000000045_S0000345	OKAY, KATIE 2020, IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR, BUT YOU HAD A BIG LIFE MOMENT HAPPEN WHEN YOU PUBLISHED YOUR FIRST BOOK. IT'S CALLED MY STORIED YEAR.
POD1000000045_S0000346	SO LET'S SEE, WHERE SHOULD WE EVEN START? I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR KIND OF WHERE DID THE STORY COME TO YOU. FIRST OF ALL, GIVE US A LITTLE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT MY STORY DEAR IS ABOUT.
POD1000000045_S0000347	AND THEN MAYBE TELL US THE STORY OF HOW DID THIS STORY COME INTO YOUR LIFE, INTO YOUR MIND? WALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF HOW THE PROCESS WAS FROM TAKING IT FROM LIKE, OH, I HAVE THIS IDEA TO NOW YOU CAN HOLD IT IN YOUR HANDS. YOU WROTE A BOOK, YOU'RE AN AUTHOR. TELL US EVERYTHING.
POD1000000045_S0000348	OKAY, SO MY STORY HERE STARTS WITH DRAGON STEWART. HE'S A SEVENTH GRADER AND HE IS DYSLEXIC AND HE HAS A REALLY HARD LIFE AT HOME AND HE'S GOT SOME BULLYING SITUATIONS GOING ON AT SCHOOL.
POD1000000045_S0000349	BUT THIS YEAR HE HAS A NEW SET OF TEACHERS AND SOME NEW KIDS IN HIS CLASS AND HIS ENGLISH TEACHER, WHO IS MY FAVORITE, REALLY KIND OF PULLS OUT THE WRITER IN HIM. HE'S LIKE A SECRET POET. HE HAS THIS JOURNAL THAT HE CARRIES AROUND AND WRITES POETRY.
POD1000000045_S0000350	BUT OTHERWISE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE TO READ OR WRITE BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR HIM. AND HE HAS KIND OF THIS SECRET STORY THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW IF HE SHOULD TELL IT OR HOW HE SHOULD TELL IT. AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000351	THROUGH THE YEAR HE KIND OF OPENS UP TO HIS FRIENDS MORE AND THEN HE'S ABLE TO KIND OF REVEAL HIS STORY AND SO THAT'S THE BASIC PREMISE OF IT.
POD1000000045_S0000352	OH MY GOODNESS, YOU HAVE SENT A COPY. IT'S ON THE WAY TO ME. I CANNOT WAIT AGAIN. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL. AND THIS JUST FEELS SO HEARTWARMING ALREADY, JUST HEARING YOU SET UP THE STORY.
POD1000000045_S0000353	YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT YOU TAUGHT ELEMENTARY. WAS THAT KIND OF A JUMPING OFF POINT FOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW THIS CHARACTER CAME INTO YOUR MIND?
POD1000000045_S0000355	SO WHEN I TAUGHT, WRITING WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THING TO TEACH. I DID A LOT OF EXTENSIVE TRAINING ON WRITING AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT SHE DOES IN THE BOOK, THERE'S KIND OF LIKE LITTLE WRITING LESSONS ALONG THE WAY THAT YOU COULD DO WITH YOUR KIDS IF YOU WERE HOMESCHOOLING THEM OR EVEN TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM.
POD1000000045_S0000356	BUT A LOT OF THOSE THINGS I LEARNED THROUGH MY TRAININGS. AND SO I WANTED TO PULL IN LIKE THE WHOLE WRITING IS THERAPY ALMOST FOR PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, HOW WE PUT THINGS INTO WORDS AND HOW OUR CREATIVITY KIND OF FIND OUT WHO WE ARE. AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000357	I WANTED TO PULL IN THAT ASPECT OF IT AND DRAGON IS REALLY KIND OF A MIXTURE OF A LOT OF KIDS THAT I TAUGHT YOU KNOW I HAD SOME HARD KIDS, YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME KIDS WITH SOME HARD LIVES AND SO.
POD1000000045_S0000358	HE'S A MIXTURE OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ONES AND I JUST HAD THE BEGINNING OF MY TEACHING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THESE KIDS BECAUSE THAT WASN'T MY LIFE EXPERIENCE. I GREW UP IN A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD AND
POD1000000045_S0000359	YOU KNOW, WE WERE ALWAYS FINANCIALLY STABLE AND SO I DIDN'T STRUGGLE LIKE THAT. AND SO WHEN I MET THESE KIDS, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE THIS EXIST, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T HAVE THAT CONTEXT. AND SO
POD1000000045_S0000360	I LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF MY YEARS HOW TO HELP THESE KIDS GET THROUGH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND HOW TO DO THINGS TO HELP THEM. AND I WISH I HAD DONE MORE. LOOKING BACK, YOU ALWAYS WISH YOU HAD DONE MORE.
POD1000000045_S0000362	YEAH.
POD1000000045_S0000363	BUT DRAGON IS JUST A MIXTURE OF ALL THOSE KIDS. SO I WANTED KIDS TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT KIDS LIKE THIS ARE REAL AND THAT THEY DO HAVE REAL PROBLEMS AND HOW, YOU KNOW,
POD1000000045_S0000364	THEY NEED SUPPORT AT SCHOOL FROM THEIR FRIENDS, FROM THEIR TEACHERS. I WANTED TO WRITE IT FOR TEACHERS TO SEE HOW, YOU KNOW, THEY CAN BE SO IMPORTANT IN THESE KIDS' LIVES, ESPECIALLY IF THEIR HOME LIFE IS NOT STABLE.
POD1000000045_S0000365	YOU KNOW, THEIR TEACHER MIGHT BE THEIR ONE ADULT THAT LOVES THEM. AND SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN THE BOOK TOO.
POD1000000045_S0000366	YES, YEAH, THAT IS SO TRUE. I MEAN, TEACHERS CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES, SOMETIMES NOT EVEN IN A GOOD WAY, BUT DEFINITELY IN POSITIVE WAYS.
POD1000000045_S0000367	AND I THINK THAT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY POINT ALONG OUR JOURNEY, BUT I THINK THOSE MIDDLE GRADE YEARS ARE SO TENDER AND SO FORMATIVE AND
POD1000000045_S0000368	WHEN YOU HAVE A TEACHER IN YOUR LIFE THAT REALLY SEES YOU AND IS REALLY ABLE TO HELP YOU TO DISCOVER WHO YOU ARE, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AN ACTUAL LIFE CHANGER.
POD1000000045_S0000369	YEAH, WHAT A GREAT CONTEXT TO SET THE STORY IN. AS YOU HAVE THIS IDEA, AND SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE FICTION, IN THE FICTION WRITING PROCESS, AND MAYBE THIS EVEN DIFFERS DEPENDING ON IF YOU'RE WRITING CHILDREN'S OR MIDDLE GRADE OR YA OR ADULT,
POD1000000045_S0000370	DO YOU FULLY WRITE THE BOOK AND THEN START TO GO TO AGENTS OR PUBLISHERS AND SAY, OKAY, I HAVE THIS THING, OR DO YOU TALK ON THE PUBLISHING END FIRST AND THEN GO AND WRITE? LIKE, WHAT WAS THAT PROCESS LIKE FOR YOU?
POD1000000045_S0000371	SO IT'S DIFFERENT FOR FICTION AND NONFICTION, WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW UNTIL I HAD KIND OF GONE THROUGH IT. BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WROTE, AND IT WASN'T EVEN THIS BOOK THAT I WROTE, I WROTE ANOTHER MANUSCRIPT.
POD1000000045_S0000372	THERE'S A HUGE WRITING CONFERENCE IN DALLAS, FORT WORTH CALLED DFW CON AND IT'S A BIG WRITING CONFERENCE.
POD1000000045_S0000373	WITH YOUR CONFERENCE TICKET, YOU GET 10 MINUTES WITH A LITERARY AGENT TO PITCH YOUR WORK. AT THAT POINT, I HAD A FINISHED MANUSCRIPT. AND WHEN I WAS KIND OF RESEARCHING THE CONFERENCE FOR FICTION, THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE A COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT.
POD1000000045_S0000374	BEFORE YOU EVER CONTACT ANYBODY. FOR NONFICTION, IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN SELL THE BOOK BEFORE YOU GO LIKE WRITE ALL OF IT. THEY SEE IF YOU HAVE A PLATFORM AND YOU WRITE A PROPOSAL AND ALL THAT STUFF, BUT THE BOOK DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE DONE.
POD1000000045_S0000375	FOR FICTION, GENERALLY THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE A COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE YOU START PITCHING IT TO ANYBODY. SO I SAT DOWN WITH THIS AGENT, I KIND OF GAVE HER MY ELEVATOR PITCH ABOUT THE BOOK,
POD1000000045_S0000376	AND THEN SHE ASKED ME TO SEND HER THE FULL MANUSCRIPT, WHICH IS KIND OF THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN HEAR AT A CONFERENCE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY I'LL PASS ON THIS OR SEND ME FIVE PAGES OR WHATEVER. SHE ASKED FOR THE FULL THING.
POD1000000045_S0000377	SO I SENT IT TO HER AND THEN, YOU KNOW, SIX, EIGHT, TEN MONTHS LATER, SHE GOT, I MEAN, IT'S A LONG WAITING PROCESS.
POD1000000045_S0000378	BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY MANUSCRIPTS THAT ARE COMING INTO THEM AND THEY HAVE TO READ THEM. AND THIS WOMAN ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING MY AGENT. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR HER BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T JUST SEND BACK LIKE, I DON'T WANT THIS.
POD1000000045_S0000379	SHE SENT BACK A LIST OF REALLY HELPFUL NOTES FOR REVISIONS AND SHE SAID, IF YOU WANT TO LIKE REVISE AND THEN RESUBMIT, I'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN. SHE WAS LIKE, I DON'T THINK WE CAN SELL IT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW, BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN.
POD1000000045_S0000380	SO I TOOK HER NOTES, DID A LOT OF THINGS, WORKED WITH A PROFESSIONAL EDITOR, AND THEN SENT IT BACK TO HER, AND THEN SHE AGREED TO REPRESENT ME. SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW THAT SITUATION WENT. BUT THAT WAS LIKE A YEAR LONG PROCESS, PROBABLY, FROM START TO FINISH.
POD1000000045_S0000381	AND THEN ONCE SHE HAS IT, I STILL WENT BACK AND REWROTE IT PROBABLY TWO OR THREE TIMES. NOT A MAJOR REHAUL, BUT JUST LIKE THESE PARTS NEED TO BE FIXED.
POD1000000045_S0000382	AND THEN SHE STARTED TO SHOP IT TO PUBLISHERS. SO SHE DID THE SAME THING I DID TO FIND AN AGENT. SHE HAD TO SEND OUT LETTERS AND SAMPLES AND ALL THAT STUFF TO DIFFERENT PUBLISHERS UNTIL WE FOUND ONE.
POD1000000045_S0000383	MY PUBLISHING JOURNEY IS KIND OF LIKE WACKY BECAUSE MY PUBLISHER BOUGHT THE FIRST BOOK THAT I WROTE, BUT THEN THEY SAID, WHAT ELSE DOES SHE HAVE? SO WE SENT HER MY STORY YEAR.
POD1000000045_S0000384	AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE WE WANT TO PUBLISH THIS ONE FIRST THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS REALLY TIMELY AND THEY WANTED TO GET IT OUT THERE
POD1000000045_S0000386	FIRST AND THEN THE FIRST BOOK THAT I SOLD WILL ACTUALLY COME OUT IN JUNE. SO THAT'S LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BOOK, BUT THEY WANTED TO GET THIS ONE OUT.
POD1000000045_S0000387	IS IT A MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL TOO?
POD1000000045_S0000388	IT'S ALSO MIDDLE GRADE AND IT'S HISTORICAL FICTION SO IT'S TOTALLY LIKE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN THIS ONE BUT YES.
POD1000000045_S0000389	THAT IS FASCINATING. I MEAN, YOU SAY THAT THE TIMELINE WAS A LITTLE WACKY, BUT IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM MY FRIENDS WHO ARE AUTHORS, IT'S THAT LIKE THE TIMELINE'S ALWAYS CRAZY. LIKE EVERYTHING TAKES SO LONG.
POD1000000045_S0000390	AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU WRITE THE, LIKE I'VE HAD FRIENDS WHO ARE NONFICTION AUTHORS WHO WRITE THE WHOLE THING, SUBMIT IT, AND THEN THE PUBLISHER IS LIKE, YEAH, NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AFTER ALL. I MEAN, THERE'S ALWAYS LIKE SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS ON THE PUBLISHING JOURNEY.
POD1000000045_S0000391	SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE, YEAH, THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE I'M SURE HAS SURPRISES ALONG THE WAY. SOME MAYBE ARE NOT SO HAPPY SURPRISES, BUT WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU IN A WAY THAT YOU REALLY, LIKE THIS WAS A HAPPY SURPRISE ABOUT THE PUBLISHING PROCESS?
POD1000000045_S0000392	THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST THAT WASN'T REALLY HAPPY WAS HOW LONG IT TOOK BECAUSE YOU KNOW, LIKE I'M LIKE I WROTE THIS BOOK AND LET'S GET IT OUT. I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW LONG OF A PROCESS IT IS FROM LIKE GETTING IT FROM A RAW DRAFT TO AN ACTUAL BOOK.
POD1000000045_S0000393	BUT I THINK THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME IN THE BEST WAY IS THAT I HAVE JUST MET SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE THAT LIKE MY EDITOR IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE SHE IS GRACIOUS BUT SHE'S TOUGH AND SHE'S, YOU KNOW, CUT THIS, YOU KNOW,
POD1000000045_S0000394	LET'S FIX THIS PART BECAUSE IT'S NOT QUITE WORKING. AND I JUST LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF AS A WRITER AND ABOUT GOOD WRITING. AND SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
POD1000000045_S0000395	I ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE ANYBODY WHO'S WRITING TO FIND YOURSELF A WRITING GROUP AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMEONE YOU MEET WITH. LIKE MY WRITING GROUP I FOUND FROM SORTA AWESOME. WE'RE IN THE SORTA AWESOME WRITERS
POD1000000045_S0000396	AND SO WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. LIKE I'M IN TEXAS AND THERE'S ONE IN NEW YORK AND ONE IN LEBANON AND ONE IN CONNECTICUT.
POD1000000045_S0000397	AND WE JUST ALL, WE SEND EACH OTHER OUR WORK EVERY WEEK AND WE HAVE A VOXER THAT WE CAN PROCESS THROUGH ALL OF OUR WRITING QUESTIONS. AND, YOU KNOW, THE DAYS THAT WE'RE LIKE, THIS IS HORRIBLE. WHY AM I DOING THIS? WE HAVE A PLACE FOR THAT. SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY, REALLY HELPFUL.
POD1000000045_S0000398	OH MY GOSH, THAT GIVES ME CHILLS. I LOVE THAT PART OF THE STORY, OBVIOUSLY.
POD1000000045_S0000400	THAT'S SO GREAT WELL AGAIN YOUR BOOK IS CALLED MY STORIED YEAR, WE WILL DEFINITELY BE FEATURING IT ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA THIS WEEK, SO THAT YOU GUYS CAN GO AND CHECK IT OUT, AND OF COURSE THERE WILL BE A LINK IN THE SHOW NOTES FOR YOU GUYS.

POD1000000046_S0001211	SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT BASKETBALL. SHE WENT TO KANSAS STATE, SO THEY JUST LOST TO A D2 PROGRAM.
POD1000000046_S0001213	17.

POD1000000046_S0001220	YEAH.
POD1000000046_S0001221	I WOULD HATE TO BE IN HIS POSITION, BUT

POD1000000046_S0001234	GOOD AFTERNOON.
POD1000000046_S0001235	GOOD AFTERNOON.
YOU1000000001_S0000001	HEY GUYS, RANDY WITH PETE'S RV TV HERE TODAY. TODAY WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO LONE PINE CAMPGROUND IN MALICE BAY, VERMONT.
YOU1000000001_S0000002	WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BACK UP A CAMPER AND PUT IT ON THE SITE. SO WE'LL BE THERE IN JUST A MINUTE AND WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU THEN.
YOU1000000001_S0000003	OKAY, HERE WE ARE AT BEAUTIFUL LONE PINE CAMPGROUND. THEY'RE NICE ENOUGH TO LET US USE THE SITE TODAY. SO I'M JUST GOING TO PULL PAST MY SITE. WE'RE GOING TO BE ON SITE 31.
YOU1000000001_S0000004	I'M GOING TO HOP OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE SITE AND SEE WHERE I WANT TO PUT THIS CAMPER AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT AHEAD AND BACK AROUND THE SITE.
YOU1000000001_S0000005	OKAY, SO WHAT I'VE DONE AT THIS POINT, AND THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY TO PUT YOUR CAMPER ON THE SITE, IS I'VE DRIVEN PAST THE SITE AND I'VE GOT THE SITE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE TRUCK.
YOU1000000001_S0000006	I DO THAT ON PURPOSE SO I CAN SEE WHERE THE SLIDE SIDE OR THE OFF DOOR SIDE OF THE CAMPER IS GOING.
YOU1000000001_S0000007	BECAUSE THAT'S THE SIDE THAT WE WANT TO KEEP AS FAR THIS WAY AS POSSIBLE TO GIVE US MORE REAL ESTATE ON THE USABLE PART OF OUR SITE.
YOU1000000001_S0000008	SO IF YOU CAN ALL DO THAT WHEN YOU PULL UP TO YOUR CAMPSITE, TRY TO KEEP THE DRIVER'S SIDE ON THE SITE SIDE. NOT ALL THE TIME YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT, BUT IF YOU CAN, THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO WORK IN YOUR BENEFIT.
YOU1000000001_S0000009	AT THIS POINT I JUST WALK THE SITE AND SEE WHAT I'VE GOT TO AVOID.
YOU1000000001_S0000010	SO I'M GOING TO WANT TO KEEP MY CAMPER, KEEP IN MIND THAT I'VE GOT A SLIDE THAT'S GOING TO GO OUT, BUT I WANT TO KEEP MY CAMPER AS FAR THIS WAY AS POSSIBLE TO GIVE ME AS MUCH REAL ESTATE ON THAT SIDE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE.
YOU1000000001_S0000011	SO THIS LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY OPEN SITE, WHICH MOST CAMPSITES ARE. WE JUST GOT TO CONTEND WITH THE STUMP THERE.
YOU1000000001_S0000012	MY POWER CORD'S GONNA BE IN THE BACK SO THAT'LL WORK OUT PERFECTLY FOR ME. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M GONNA DO NOW IS JUST POP BACK IN THE TRUCK AND SEE IF WE CAN NEGOTIATE THIS GUY ONTO THE SITE.
YOU1000000001_S0000013	I'M GOING TO PULL AHEAD JUST A HAIR AND I'M GOING TO PUT THE TAIL OF MY CAMPER HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT I WANT TO BACK THIS GUY UP ON.
YOU1000000001_S0000014	NOW, VERY IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT IS REMEMBERING THAT OUR WHEELS ARE THE PIVOT POINT FOR OUR CAMPER. SO THAT'S WHERE THE CAMPER IS GOING TO TURN.
YOU1000000001_S0000015	SO I DON'T WANT TO WATCH THE FRONT OF THE CAMPER OR THE BACK SO MUCH. I WANT TO KEEP MY EYES ON THE WHEELS. SO HERE WE GO.
YOU1000000001_S0000016	SOMETIMES WHEN I'M DRIVING A DIFFERENT TRUCK, THIS TRUCK'S WORKING OUT PRETTY WELL, BUT SOMETIMES I'LL EVEN ANGLE THE MIRROR DOWN SO I CAN SEE THE WHEELS A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
YOU1000000001_S0000017	SO I'LL MAKE SURE I GOT NOTHING GOING ON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ME.
YOU1000000001_S0000019	I'M JUST LETTING THE CAMPER DO THE JOB HERE. KEEP AN EYE ON BOTH MIRRORS. OBVIOUSLY TURN THE STEERING WHEEL THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT YOU WANT THE UNIT TO GO.
YOU1000000001_S0000021	AND AS YOU START GETTING CLOSE TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BE STRAIGHT, THAT'S WHEN YOU WANT TO START COUNTER STEERING.
YOU1000000001_S0000023	WE'RE GETTING THE UNIT ON THERE PRETTY STRAIGHT, NOTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU1000000001_S0000025	BOY, I THINK I'M GOING TO HIT THIS ONE PRETTY GOOD RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
YOU1000000001_S0000027	NOW IF YOU'RE FINDING THAT YOU'RE NOT BACKING ON STRAIGHT OR YOU KNOW THE CAMPER JUST KEEPS JACKKNIFING ON YOU A LITTLE BIT
YOU1000000001_S0000028	MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK TO GET THE TRUCK OUT WHERE YOU NEED IT TO, TO GET YOU STRAIGHT.
YOU1000000001_S0000029	YOU ALWAYS CAN PUT THE TRUCK BACK IN DRIVE AND PULL FORWARD AND STRAIGHTEN THE TRAILER OUT.
YOU1000000001_S0000030	SO IF YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR PAST AND THE CAMPER'S GOING THE WRONG WAY OR THE BACK END OF THE CAMPER HAS GONE TOO FAR THE WAY YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GO,
YOU1000000001_S0000031	SIMPLY PUT THE TRUCK IN DRIVE AND PULL STRAIGHT AHEAD AND THAT'S GONNA STRAIGHTEN THE UNIT OUT FOR YOU. SO WE'RE GONNA JUST BACK THIS GUY UP HERE.
YOU1000000001_S0000033	I THINK I'VE HIT MY MARK.
YOU1000000001_S0000035	NOW THIS IS THE POINT WHERE IF YOU WATCH MY LEVELING VIDEO IS WHERE YOU WANT TO GET OUT AND CHECK THE CAMPER FOR LEVEL. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000001_S0000036	SO THAT FIRST TIME WENT VERY EASY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PARK. SO NOW I'M GOING TO TRY TO SIMULATE A FULL PARK WITH CARS AND CAMPERS ON MY OTHER SIDE.
YOU1000000001_S0000037	I'M GOING TO TRY TO KEEP MY VEHICLE ON THE ROAD WITHOUT GOING ON THE LAWN OVER THERE LIKE I DID ON THE LAST PULL IN.
YOU1000000001_S0000038	SO THIS TIME I'M GOING TO START BACKING UP A LITTLE BIT SOONER.
YOU1000000001_S0000039	I'VE JUST GOT MY CAMPER KIND OF HEADED AND YOU CAN SEE WITH THE CAMPER HEADED IT'S GOING TO START TO TURN EVEN WITH MY TRUCK STRAIGHT.
YOU1000000001_S0000041	THE CAMPER IS STARTING TO TURN MORE AND MORE. I AM GOING TO COMPENSATE WITH A HAIR NOW.
YOU1000000001_S0000043	NOW I'M REALLY GOING TO JACKKNIFE THIS CAMPER.
YOU1000000001_S0000045	I'LL TRY TO SWING THIS THING AROUND. NOW I CAN START TO TURN MY TRUCK A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000001_S0000047	SO I'VE STAYED ON THE ROAD FOR THE MOST PART. I'VE GOT MY CAMPER PRETTY STRAIGHT.
YOU1000000001_S0000048	BUT YOU SEE THE BACK END OF THE CAMPER STILL WANTS TO SWING AROUND BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK TO GET IT TO WHERE I WANT TO GO.
YOU1000000001_S0000049	THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE MOSTLY RUN INTO TROUBLE. SO I'VE GOT A TRICK FOR THIS TOO.
YOU1000000001_S0000050	IF I KEEP BACKING UP, MY BACK END OF MY CAMPER IS JUST GOING TO KEEP SWINGING WHERE I DON'T WANT IT TO SWING.
YOU1000000001_S0000051	A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL GO BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH AND THEY NEVER FIND THAT HAPPY SPOT. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AT THIS POINT IS I'M JUST GOING TO STOP THE TRUCK RIGHT HERE.
YOU1000000001_S0000052	AND I'M GOING TO UNHOOK THE CAMPER. SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT THIS WILL GET YOU OUT OF A PINCH IN A SECOND.
YOU1000000001_S0000053	OKAY SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE TURNED OFF THE CAMERA.
YOU1000000001_S0000054	I UNHOOKED THE TRUCK FROM THE CAMPER. I RE SITUATED MY TRUCK SO NOW MY TRUCK IS STRAIGHT IN LINE WITH THE CAMPER.
YOU1000000001_S0000055	AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO BACK UP ON THE SITE. AND NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA BE JACKKNIFING OR HAVING THE CAMERA OFF ANGLE ON OUR SITE BECAUSE I'VE NOW STRAIGHTENED THE TRUCK OUT AND THAT WAS OUR PROBLEM.
YOU1000000001_S0000056	SO I'M GONNA HOP BACK IN THE TRUCK AND FINISH BACKING UP ON THE SITE AND WE'RE GONNA BE GOOD TO GO HERE. OKAY, SO HERE WE GO BACK UP FOR OUR FINAL DESTINATION.
YOU1000000001_S0000057	YOU GOT SOMEBODY WITH YOU BEHIND YOU TO KEEP AN EYE OUT NOT A BAD IDEA
YOU1000000001_S0000059	THAT LOOKS GOOD RIGHT ABOUT THERE. SO AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT AND DO A COUPLE OF THE CHECKS THAT I LIKE TO DO JUST TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT ENOUGH ROOM.
YOU1000000001_S0000060	NOW WE KNOW WE'VE GOT OUR STUMP HERE, SO I'M GONNA DO MY ARM CHECK. WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM THERE
YOU1000000001_S0000061	I'M RIGHT OFF MY ELECTRICAL BOX. MY ELECTRICAL CORD IS GOING TO BE HERE. SO I'M WITHIN MY 25 FEET HERE I THINK THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT SPOT
YOU1000000001_S0000062	I'M GOING TO RUN THE SLIDE OUT OUT AND PUT CHECK THE LEVELS ON THE FRONT OF THE CAMPER AND SEE IF WE'RE LEVEL AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT FROM THERE.
YOU1000000001_S0000063	SO IN A NUTSHELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE GET INTIMIDATED BY THIS. IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE PROCESS. DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY WATCHING ME. I'M JUST FOCUSED ON WHAT I'M DOING.
YOU1000000001_S0000064	IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HIT THE MARK ON THE FIRST TIME OUT, BUT THE MORE AND MORE YOU DO IT, AND THE LESS YOU WORRY ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WATCHING YOU, THE EASIER IT'S GOING TO BE FOR YOU.
YOU1000000001_S0000065	SO JUST FOLLOW MY QUICK STEPS. MAKE SURE YOU WATCH YOUR WHEELS, WATCH YOUR MIRRORS.
YOU1000000001_S0000066	IF YOU CAN'T GET THE CAMPER EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT, UNHOOK THE TRUCK AND RE SITUATE THE TRUCK AND THE NEXT TIME YOU'LL BE RIGHT ON THE SITE RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT IT.

YOU1000000003_S0000001	THIS IS A 3. IT'S SLOPPILY WRITTEN AND RENDERED AT AN EXTREMELY LOW RESOLUTION OF 28X28 PIXELS
YOU1000000003_S0000002	BUT YOUR BRAIN HAS NO TROUBLE RECOGNIZING IT AS A 3.
YOU1000000003_S0000003	AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE HOW CRAZY IT IS THAT BRAINS CAN DO THIS SO EFFORTLESSLY.
YOU1000000003_S0000004	I MEAN THIS, THIS, AND THIS ARE ALSO RECOGNIZABLE AS 3S.
YOU1000000003_S0000005	EVEN THOUGH THE SPECIFIC VALUES OF EACH PIXEL IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE IMAGE TO THE NEXT.
YOU1000000003_S0000006	THE PARTICULAR LIGHT SENSITIVE CELLS IN YOUR EYE THAT ARE FIRING WHEN YOU SEE THESE THREE ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES FIRING WHEN YOU SEE THESE THREE.
YOU1000000003_S0000007	BUT SOMETHING IN THAT CRAZY SMART VISUAL CORTEX OF YOURS RESOLVES THESE AS REPRESENTING THE SAME IDEA.
YOU1000000003_S0000008	WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZING OTHER IMAGES AS THEIR OWN DISTINCT IDEAS.
YOU1000000003_S0000009	BUT IF I TOLD YOU, HEY, SIT DOWN AND WRITE FOR ME A PROGRAM THAT TAKES IN A GRID OF 28X28 PIXELS LIKE THIS,
YOU1000000003_S0000010	AND OUTPUTS A SINGLE NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 10, TELLING YOU WHAT IT THINKS THE DIGIT IS,
YOU1000000003_S0000011	WHILE THE TEST GOES FROM COMICALLY TRIVIAL TO DAUNTINGLY DIFFICULT.
YOU1000000003_S0000012	UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK, I THINK I HARDLY NEED TO MOTIVATE THE RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS.
YOU1000000003_S0000013	TO THE PRESENT AND TO THE FUTURE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE IS SHOW YOU WHAT A NEURAL NETWORK ACTUALLY IS.
YOU1000000003_S0000014	ASSUMING NO BACKGROUND, AND TO HELP VISUALIZE WHAT IT'S DOING. NOT AS A BUZZWORD, BUT AS A PIECE OF MATH.
YOU1000000003_S0000015	MY HOPE IS JUST THAT YOU COME AWAY FEELING LIKE THE STRUCTURE ITSELF IS MOTIVATED.
YOU1000000003_S0000016	AND TO FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN YOU READ OR YOU HEAR ABOUT A NEURAL NETWORK QUOTE UNQUOTE LEARNING.
YOU1000000003_S0000017	THIS VIDEO IS JUST GOING TO BE DEVOTED TO THE STRUCTURE COMPONENT OF THAT, AND THE FOLLOWING ONE IS GOING TO TACKLE LEARNING.
YOU1000000003_S0000018	WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT TOGETHER A NEURAL NETWORK THAT CAN LEARN TO RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN DIGITS.
YOU1000000003_S0000020	THIS IS A SOMEWHAT CLASSIC EXAMPLE FOR INTRODUCING THE TOPIC.
YOU1000000003_S0000021	AND I'M HAPPY TO STICK WITH THE STATUS QUO HERE, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE TWO VIDEOS, I WANT TO POINT YOU TO A COUPLE GOOD RESOURCES WHERE YOU CAN LEARN MORE.
YOU1000000003_S0000022	AND WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE CODE THAT DOES THIS AND PLAY WITH IT ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER.
YOU1000000003_S0000024	THERE ARE MANY, MANY VARIANTS OF NEURAL NETWORKS AND IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A BOOM IN RESEARCH TOWARDS THESE VARIANTS.
YOU1000000003_S0000025	BUT IN THESE TWO INTRODUCTORY VIDEOS, YOU AND I ARE JUST GOING TO LOOK AT THE SIMPLEST PLAIN VANILLA FORM WITH NO ADDED FRILLS.
YOU1000000003_S0000026	THIS IS KIND OF A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE FOR UNDERSTANDING ANY OF THE MORE POWERFUL MODERN VARIANTS.
YOU1000000003_S0000027	AND TRUST ME, IT STILL HAS PLENTY OF COMPLEXITY FOR US TO WRAP OUR MINDS AROUND.
YOU1000000003_S0000028	BUT EVEN IN THIS SIMPLEST FORM, IT CAN LEARN TO RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN DIGITS.
YOU1000000003_S0000029	WHICH IS A PRETTY COOL THING FOR A COMPUTER TO BE ABLE TO DO.
YOU1000000003_S0000031	AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'LL SEE HOW IT DOES FALL SHORT OF A COUPLE HOPES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR IT.
YOU1000000003_S0000033	AS THE NAME SUGGESTS, NEURAL NETWORKS ARE INSPIRED BY THE BRAIN. BUT LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN. WHAT ARE THE NEURONS, AND IN WHAT SENSE ARE THEY LINKED TOGETHER?
YOU1000000003_S0000034	RIGHT NOW, WHEN I SAY NEURON, ALL I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS A THING THAT HOLDS A NUMBER, SPECIFICALLY A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 1. IT'S REALLY NOT MORE THAN THAT.
YOU1000000003_S0000036	FOR EXAMPLE, THE NETWORK STARTS WITH A BUNCH OF NEURONS CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE 28 TIMES 28 PIXELS OF THE INPUT IMAGE
YOU1000000003_S0000037	WHICH IS 784 NEURONS IN TOTAL. EACH ONE OF THESE HOLDS A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS THE GRAYSCALE VALUE OF THE CORRESPONDING PIXEL.
YOU1000000003_S0000038	RANGING FROM 0 FOR BLACK PIXELS UP TO 1 FOR WHITE PIXELS. THIS NUMBER INSIDE THE NEURON IS CALLED ITS ACTIVATION.
YOU1000000003_S0000039	AND THE IMAGE YOU MIGHT HAVE IN MIND HERE IS THAT EACH NEURON IS LIT UP WHEN ITS ACTIVATION IS A HIGH NUMBER.
YOU1000000003_S0000041	SO ALL OF THESE 784 NEURONS MAKE UP THE FIRST LAYER OF OUR NETWORK.
YOU1000000003_S0000043	NOW JUMPING OVER TO THE LAST LAYER, THIS HAS 10 NEURONS, EACH REPRESENTING ONE OF THE DIGITS.
YOU1000000003_S0000044	THE ACTIVATION IN THESE NEURONS, AGAIN SOME NUMBER THAT'S BETWEEN 0 AND 1,
YOU1000000003_S0000045	REPRESENTS HOW MUCH THE SYSTEM THINKS THAT A GIVEN IMAGE CORRESPONDS WITH A GIVEN DIGIT.
YOU1000000003_S0000046	THERE'S ALSO A COUPLE LAYERS IN BETWEEN CALLED THE HIDDEN LAYERS, WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING SHOULD JUST BE A GIANT QUESTION MARK.
YOU1000000003_S0000047	FOR HOW ON EARTH THIS PROCESS OF RECOGNIZING DIGITS IS GOING TO BE HANDLED. IN THIS NETWORK I CHOSE TWO HIDDEN LAYERS, EACH ONE WITH 16 NEURONS.
YOU1000000003_S0000048	AND ADMITTEDLY, THAT'S KIND OF AN ARBITRARY CHOICE. TO BE HONEST, I CHOSE TWO LAYERS BASED ON HOW I WANT TO MOTIVATE THE STRUCTURE IN JUST A MOMENT.
YOU1000000003_S0000049	AND 16? WELL THAT WAS JUST A NICE NUMBER TO FIT ON THE SCREEN. IN PRACTICE THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR EXPERIMENT WITH A SPECIFIC STRUCTURE HERE.
YOU1000000003_S0000050	THE WAY THE NETWORK OPERATES, ACTIVATIONS IN ONE LAYER DETERMINE THE ACTIVATIONS OF THE NEXT LAYER.
YOU1000000003_S0000051	AND OF COURSE THE HEART OF THE NETWORK AS AN INFORMATION PROCESSING MECHANISM COMES DOWN TO EXACTLY HOW THOSE ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYER BRING ABOUT ACTIVATIONS IN THE NEXT LAYER.
YOU1000000003_S0000052	IT'S MEANT TO BE LOOSELY ANALOGOUS TO HOW IN BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS OF NEURONS, SOME GROUPS OF NEURONS FIRING CAUSE CERTAIN OTHERS TO FIRE.
YOU1000000003_S0000053	THE NETWORK I'M SHOWING HERE HAS ALREADY BEEN TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE DIGITS, AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN BY THAT.
YOU1000000003_S0000054	IT MEANS IF YOU FEED IN AN IMAGE, LIGHTING UP ALL 784 NEURONS OF THE INPUT LAYER ACCORDING TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF EACH PIXEL IN THE IMAGE,
YOU1000000003_S0000055	THAT PATTERN OF ACTIVATIONS CAUSES SOME VERY SPECIFIC PATTERN IN THE NEXT LAYER, WHICH CAUSES SOME PATTERN IN THE ONE AFTER IT,
YOU1000000003_S0000056	WHICH FINALLY GIVES SOME PATTERN IN THE OUTPUT LAYER. AND THE BRIGHTEST NEURON OF THAT OUTPUT LAYER IS THE NETWORK'S CHOICE, SO TO SPEAK, FOR WHAT DIGIT THIS IMAGE REPRESENTS.
YOU1000000003_S0000058	AND BEFORE JUMPING INTO THE MATH FOR HOW ONE LAYER INFLUENCES THE NEXT, OR HOW TRAINING WORKS,
YOU1000000003_S0000059	LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S EVEN REASONABLE TO EXPECT A LAYERED STRUCTURE LIKE THIS TO BEHAVE INTELLIGENTLY.
YOU1000000003_S0000060	WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING HERE? WHAT IS THE BEST HOPE FOR WHAT THOSE MIDDLE LAYERS MIGHT BE DOING?
YOU1000000003_S0000061	WELL, WHEN YOU OR I RECOGNIZE DIGITS, WE PIECE TOGETHER VARIOUS COMPONENTS. A 9 HAS A LOOP UP TOP AND A LINE ON THE RIGHT.
YOU1000000003_S0000062	AN 8 ALSO HAS A LOOP UP TOP, BUT IT'S PAIRED WITH ANOTHER LOOP DOWN LOW.
YOU1000000003_S0000063	A 4 BASICALLY BREAKS DOWN INTO 3 SPECIFIC LINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000003_S0000064	IN A PERFECT WORLD, WE MIGHT HOPE THAT EACH NEURON IN THE SECOND TO LAST LAYER CORRESPONDS WITH ONE OF THESE SUBCOMPONENTS.
YOU1000000003_S0000065	THAT ANYTIME YOU FEED IN AN IMAGE WITH, SAY, A LOOP UP TOP, LIKE A 9 OR AN 8, THERE'S SOME SPECIFIC NEURON WHOSE ACTIVATION IS GOING TO BE CLOSE TO 1.
YOU1000000003_S0000066	AND I DON'T MEAN THIS SPECIFIC LOOP OF PIXELS, THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT ANY GENERALLY LOOPY PATTERN TOWARDS THE TOP SETS OFF THIS NEURON.
YOU1000000003_S0000067	THAT WAY, GOING FROM THE THIRD LAYER TO THE LAST ONE JUST REQUIRES LEARNING WHICH COMBINATION OF SUBCOMPONENTS CORRESPONDS TO WHICH DIGITS.
YOU1000000003_S0000068	OF COURSE THAT JUST KICKS THE PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE HOW WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE THESE SUBCOMPONENTS OR EVEN LEARN WHAT THE RIGHT SUBCOMPONENTS SHOULD BE?
YOU1000000003_S0000069	AND I STILL HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT HOW ONE LAYER INFLUENCES THE NEXT, BUT RUN WITH ME ON THIS ONE FOR A MOMENT. RECOGNIZING A LOOP CAN ALSO BREAK DOWN INTO SUBPROBLEMS.
YOU1000000003_S0000070	ONE REASONABLE WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO FIRST RECOGNIZE THE VARIOUS LITTLE EDGES THAT MAKE IT UP.
YOU1000000003_S0000071	SIMILARLY, A LONG LINE, LIKE THE KIND YOU MIGHT SEE IN THE DIGITS 1, 4, OR 7, IS REALLY JUST A LONG EDGE, OR MAYBE YOU THINK OF IT AS A CERTAIN PATTERN OF SEVERAL SMALLER EDGES.
YOU1000000003_S0000072	SO, MAYBE, OUR HOPE IS THAT EACH NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER OF THE NETWORK CORRESPONDS WITH THE VARIOUS RELEVANT LITTLE EDGES.
YOU1000000003_S0000073	MAYBE, WHEN AN IMAGE LIKE THIS ONE COMES IN, IT LIGHTS UP ALL THE NEURONS ASSOCIATED WITH AROUND 8 10 SPECIFIC LITTLE EDGES,
YOU1000000003_S0000074	WHICH IN TURN LIGHTS UP THE NEURONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOOP AND A LONG VERTICAL LINE, AND THOSE LIGHT UP THE NEURON ASSOCIATED WITH THE 9.
YOU1000000003_S0000075	WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS WHAT OUR FINAL NETWORK ACTUALLY DOES IS ANOTHER QUESTION, ONE THAT I'LL COME BACK TO ONCE WE SEE HOW TO TRAIN THE NETWORK.
YOU1000000003_S0000076	BUT THIS IS A HOPE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE, A SORT OF GOAL WITH THE LAYERED STRUCTURE LIKE THIS.
YOU1000000003_S0000077	MOREOVER, YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW BEING ABLE TO DETECT EDGES AND PATTERNS LIKE THIS WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL FOR OTHER IMAGE RECOGNITION TASKS.
YOU1000000003_S0000078	AND EVEN BEYOND IMAGE RECOGNITION, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF INTELLIGENT THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT BREAK DOWN INTO LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION.
YOU1000000003_S0000079	PARSING SPEECH, FOR EXAMPLE, INVOLVES TAKING RAW AUDIO AND PICKING OUT DISTINCT SOUNDS, WHICH COMBINE TO MAKE CERTAIN SYLLABLES,
YOU1000000003_S0000080	WHICH COMBINE TO FORM WORDS, WHICH COMBINE TO MAKE UP PHRASES AND MORE ABSTRACT THOUGHTS, ETC.
YOU1000000003_S0000081	BUT GETTING BACK TO HOW ANY OF THIS ACTUALLY WORKS, PICTURE YOURSELF RIGHT NOW DESIGNING HOW EXACTLY THE ACTIVATIONS IN ONE LAYER MIGHT DETERMINE THE ACTIVATIONS IN THE NEXT.
YOU1000000003_S0000082	THE GOAL IS TO HAVE SOME MECHANISM THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY COMBINE PIXELS INTO EDGES, OR EDGES INTO PATTERNS, OR PATTERNS INTO DIGITS.
YOU1000000003_S0000083	AND TO ZOOM IN ON ONE VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY THE HOPE IS FOR ONE PARTICULAR NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER,
YOU1000000003_S0000084	TO PICK UP ON WHETHER OR NOT THE IMAGE HAS AN EDGE IN THIS REGION HERE.
YOU1000000003_S0000085	THE QUESTION AT HAND IS WHAT PARAMETERS SHOULD THE NETWORK HAVE? WHAT DIALS AND KNOBS SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TWEAK?
YOU1000000003_S0000086	SO THAT IT'S EXPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY CAPTURE THIS PATTERN, OR ANY OTHER PIXEL PATTERN, OR THE PATTERN THAT SEVERAL EDGES CAN MAKE A LOOP, AND OTHER SUCH THINGS.
YOU1000000003_S0000087	WHAT WE'LL DO IS ASSIGN A WEIGHT TO EACH ONE OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN OUR NEURON AND THE NEURONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER.
YOU1000000003_S0000088	THESE WEIGHTS ARE JUST NUMBERS. THEN, TAKE ALL OF THOSE ACTIVATIONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER AND COMPUTE THEIR WEIGHTED SUM ACCORDING TO THESE WEIGHTS.
YOU1000000003_S0000090	I FIND IT HELPFUL TO THINK OF THESE WEIGHTS AS BEING ORGANIZED INTO A LITTLE GRID OF THEIR OWN. AND I'M GOING TO USE GREEN PIXELS TO INDICATE POSITIVE WEIGHTS AND RED PIXELS TO INDICATE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS.
YOU1000000003_S0000091	WHERE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT PIXEL IS SOME LOOSE DEPICTION OF THE WEIGHT'S VALUE.
YOU1000000003_S0000092	IF WE MADE THE WEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALMOST ALL OF THE PIXELS 0, EXCEPT FOR SOME POSITIVE WEIGHTS IN THIS REGION WE CARE ABOUT,
YOU1000000003_S0000093	THEN TAKING THE WEIGHTED SUM OF ALL THE PIXEL VALUES REALLY JUST AMOUNTS TO ADDING UP THE VALUES OF THE PIXEL JUST IN THE REGION THAT WE CARE ABOUT.
YOU1000000003_S0000095	AND IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO PICK UP ON WHETHER THERE'S AN EDGE HERE, WHAT YOU MIGHT DO IS HAVE SOME NEGATIVE WEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURROUNDING PIXELS.
YOU1000000003_S0000096	THEN, THE SUM IS LARGEST WHEN THE MIDDLE PIXELS ARE BRIGHT, BUT THE SURROUNDING PIXELS ARE DARKER.
YOU1000000003_S0000098	WHEN YOU COMPUTE A WEIGHTED SUM LIKE THIS, YOU MIGHT COME OUT WITH ANY NUMBER, BUT FOR THIS NETWORK, WHAT WE WANT IS FOR ACTIVATIONS TO BE SOME VALUE BETWEEN 0 AND 1.
YOU1000000003_S0000099	SO A COMMON THING TO DO IS TO PUMP THIS WEIGHTED SUM INTO SOME FUNCTION THAT SQUISHES THE REAL NUMBER LINE INTO THE RANGE BETWEEN 0 AND 1.
YOU1000000003_S0000100	A COMMON FUNCTION THAT DOES THIS IS CALLED THE SIGMOID FUNCTION, ALSO KNOWN AS A LOGISTIC CURVE.
YOU1000000003_S0000101	BASICALLY, VERY NEGATIVE INPUTS END UP CLOSE TO 0, VERY POSITIVE INPUTS END UP CLOSE TO 1, AND IT JUST STEADILY INCREASES AROUND THE INPUT 0.
YOU1000000003_S0000103	SO THE ACTIVATION OF THE NEURON HERE IS BASICALLY A MEASURE OF HOW POSITIVE THE RELEVANT WEIGHTED SUM IS.
YOU1000000003_S0000105	BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT YOU WANT THE NEURON TO LIGHT UP WHEN THE WEIGHTED SUM IS BIGGER THAN 0. MAYBE YOU ONLY WANT IT TO BE ACTIVE WHEN THE SUM IS BIGGER THAN, SAY, 10.
YOU1000000003_S0000106	THAT IS, YOU WANT SOME BIAS FOR IT TO BE INACTIVE.
YOU1000000003_S0000107	WE'LL THEN ADD IN SOME OTHER NUMBER, LIKE NEGATIVE 10, TO THIS WEIGHTED SUM BEFORE PLUGGING IT THROUGH THE SIGMOID SQUISHIFICATION FUNCTION.
YOU1000000003_S0000108	THAT ADDITIONAL NUMBER IS CALLED THE BIAS.
YOU1000000003_S0000109	THE WEIGHTS TELL YOU WHAT PIXEL PATTERN THIS NEURON IN THE SECOND LAYER IS PICKING UP ON, AND THE BIAS TELLS YOU HOW HIGH THE WEIGHTED SUM NEEDS TO BE
YOU1000000003_S0000110	BEFORE THE NEURON STARTS GETTING MEANINGFULLY ACTIVE.
YOU1000000003_S0000111	THAT'S JUST ONE NEURON, EVERY OTHER NEURON IN THIS LAYER IS CONNECTED TO ALL 784 PIXEL NEURONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER.
YOU1000000003_S0000112	AND EACH ONE OF THOSE 784 CONNECTIONS HAS ITS OWN WEIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
YOU1000000003_S0000113	ALSO, EACH ONE HAS SOME BIAS, SOME OTHER NUMBER YOU ADD ON TO THE WEIGHTED SUM BEFORE SQUISHING IT WITH THE SIGMOID.
YOU1000000003_S0000114	AND THAT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.
YOU1000000003_S0000115	WITH THIS HIDDEN LAYER OF 16 NEURONS, THAT'S A TOTAL OF 784 TIMES 16 WEIGHTS ALONG WITH 16 BIASES.
YOU1000000003_S0000116	AND ALL OF THAT IS JUST THE CONNECTIONS FROM THE FIRST LAYER TO THE SECOND. THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE OTHER LAYERS ALSO HAVE A BUNCH OF WEIGHTS AND BIASES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.
YOU1000000003_S0000117	ALL SAID AND DONE, THIS NETWORK HAS ALMOST EXACTLY 13,000 TOTAL WEIGHTS AND BIASES.
YOU1000000003_S0000118	13,000 KNOBS AND DIALS THAT CAN BE TWEAKED AND TURNED TO MAKE THIS NETWORK BEHAVE IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
YOU1000000003_S0000120	SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LEARNING, WHAT THAT'S REFERRING TO IS GETTING THE COMPUTER TO FIND A VALID SETTING FOR ALL OF THESE MANY, MANY NUMBERS SO THAT IT'LL ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT HAND.
YOU1000000003_S0000122	ONE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT IS AT ONCE FUN AND KIND OF HORRIFYING IS TO IMAGINE SITTING DOWN AND SETTING ALL OF THESE WEIGHTS AND BIASES BY HAND.
YOU1000000003_S0000123	PURPOSEFULLY TWEAKING THE NUMBERS SO THAT THE SECOND LAYER PICKS UP ON EDGES, THE THIRD LAYER PICKS UP ON PATTERNS, ETC.
YOU1000000003_S0000124	I PERSONALLY FIND THIS SATISFYING, RATHER THAN JUST TREATING THE NETWORK AS A TOTAL BLACK BOX.
YOU1000000003_S0000125	BECAUSE WHEN THE NETWORK DOESN'T PERFORM THE WAY YOU ANTICIPATE,
YOU1000000003_S0000126	IF YOU'VE BUILT UP A LITTLE BIT OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH WHAT THOSE WEIGHTS AND BIASES ACTUALLY MEAN, YOU HAVE A STARTING PLACE FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH HOW TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE TO IMPROVE.
YOU1000000003_S0000127	OR, WHEN THE NETWORK DOES WORK, BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, DIGGING INTO WHAT THE WEIGHTS AND BIASES ARE DOING IS A GOOD WAY TO CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS.
YOU1000000003_S0000128	AND REALLY EXPOSE THE FULL SPACE OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.
YOU1000000003_S0000129	BY THE WAY, THE ACTUAL FUNCTION HERE IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME TO WRITE DOWN, DON'T YOU THINK?
YOU1000000003_S0000131	SO LET ME SHOW YOU A MORE NOTATIONALLY COMPACT WAY THAT THESE CONNECTIONS ARE REPRESENTED. THIS IS HOW YOU'D SEE IT IF YOU CHOOSE TO READ UP MORE ABOUT NEURAL NETWORKS.
YOU1000000003_S0000132	ORGANIZE ALL OF THE ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYER INTO A COLUMN AS A VECTOR.
YOU1000000003_S0000134	THEN ORGANIZE ALL OF THE WEIGHTS AS A MATRIX, WHERE EACH ROW OF THAT MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ONE LAYER AND A PARTICULAR NEURON IN THE NEXT LAYER.
YOU1000000003_S0000135	WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT TAKING THE WEIGHTED SUM OF THE ACTIVATIONS IN THE FIRST LAYER ACCORDING TO THESE WEIGHTS
YOU1000000003_S0000136	CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE TERMS IN THE MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCT OF EVERYTHING WE HAVE ON THE LEFT HERE.
YOU1000000003_S0000138	BY THE WAY, SO MUCH OF MACHINE LEARNING JUST COMES DOWN TO HAVING A GOOD GRASP OF LINEAR ALGEBRA
YOU1000000003_S0000139	SO FOR ANY OF YOU WHO WANT A NICE VISUAL UNDERSTANDING FOR MATRICES AND WHAT MATRIX VECTOR MULTIPLICATION MEANS, TAKE A LOOK AT THE SERIES I DID ON LINEAR ALGEBRA, ESPECIALLY CHAPTER 3.
YOU1000000003_S0000140	BACK TO OUR EXPRESSION, INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT ADDING THE BIAS TO EACH ONE OF THESE VALUES INDEPENDENTLY,
YOU1000000003_S0000141	WE REPRESENT IT BY ORGANIZING ALL THOSE BIASES INTO A VECTOR, AND ADDING THE ENTIRE VECTOR TO THE PREVIOUS MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCT.
YOU1000000003_S0000142	THEN AS A FINAL STEP, I'LL WRAP A SIGMOID AROUND THE OUTSIDE HERE.
YOU1000000003_S0000143	AND WHAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY THE SIGMOID FUNCTION TO EACH SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE RESULTING VECTOR INSIDE.
YOU1000000003_S0000144	SO, ONCE YOU WRITE DOWN THIS WEIGHT MATRIX AND THESE VECTORS AS THEIR OWN SYMBOLS, YOU CAN COMMUNICATE THE FULL TRANSITION OF ACTIVATIONS FROM ONE LAYER TO THE NEXT
YOU1000000003_S0000145	IN AN EXTREMELY TIGHT AND NEAT LITTLE EXPRESSION.
YOU1000000003_S0000146	AND THIS MAKES THE RELEVANT CODE BOTH A LOT SIMPLER AND A LOT FASTER SINCE MANY LIBRARIES OPTIMIZE THE HECK OUT OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
YOU1000000003_S0000148	REMEMBER HOW EARLIER I SAID THESE NEURONS ARE SIMPLY THINGS THAT HOLD NUMBERS? WELL, OF COURSE, THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT THEY HOLD DEPENDS ON THE IMAGE YOU FEED IN.
YOU1000000003_S0000150	SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE ACCURATE TO THINK OF EACH NEURON AS A FUNCTION, ONE THAT TAKES IN THE OUTPUTS OF ALL THE NEURONS IN THE PREVIOUS LAYER AND SPITS OUT A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 1.
YOU1000000003_S0000151	REALLY, THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS JUST A FUNCTION, ONE THAT TAKES IN 784 NUMBERS AS AN INPUT AND SPITS OUT 10 NUMBERS AS AN OUTPUT.
YOU1000000003_S0000152	IT'S AN ABSURDLY COMPLICATED FUNCTION, ONE THAT INVOLVES 13,000 PARAMETERS IN THE FORMS OF THESE WEIGHTS AND BIASES THAT PICK UP ON CERTAIN PATTERNS.
YOU1000000003_S0000153	AND WHICH INVOLVES ITERATING MANY MATRIX VECTOR PRODUCTS AND THE SIGMOID SQUISHIFICATION FUNCTION.
YOU1000000003_S0000154	BUT IT'S JUST A FUNCTION NONETHELESS. AND IN A WAY, IT'S KIND OF REASSURING THAT IT LOOKS COMPLICATED.
YOU1000000003_S0000155	I MEAN, IF IT WERE ANY SIMPLER, WHAT HOPE WOULD WE HAVE THAT IT COULD TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE OF RECOGNIZING DIGITS? AND HOW DOES IT TAKE ON THAT CHALLENGE?
YOU1000000003_S0000156	HOW DOES THIS NETWORK LEARN THE APPROPRIATE WEIGHTS AND BIASES JUST BY LOOKING AT DATA? WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'LL SHOW IN THE NEXT VIDEO.
YOU1000000003_S0000157	I'LL ALSO DIG A LITTLE MORE INTO WHAT THIS PARTICULAR NETWORK WE'RE SEEING IS REALLY DOING.
YOU1000000003_S0000159	NOW IS THE POINT I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY SUBSCRIBE TO STAY NOTIFIED ABOUT WHEN THAT VIDEO OR ANY NEW VIDEOS COME OUT.
YOU1000000003_S0000160	BUT REALISTICALLY, MOST OF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS FROM YOUTUBE, DO YOU?
YOU1000000003_S0000161	MAYBE MORE HONESTLY, I SHOULD SAY SUBSCRIBE SO THAT THE NEURAL NETWORKS THAT UNDERLIE YOUTUBE'S RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM
YOU1000000003_S0000162	ARE PRIMED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE CONTENT FROM THIS CHANNEL GET RECOMMENDED TO YOU. ANYWAY, STAY POSTED FOR MORE.
YOU1000000003_S0000163	THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO EVERYONE SUPPORTING THESE VIDEOS ON PATREON.
YOU1000000003_S0000164	I'VE BEEN A LITTLE SLOW TO PROGRESS IN THE PROBABILITY SERIES THIS SUMMER, BUT I'M JUMPING BACK INTO IT AFTER THIS PROJECT, SO PATRONS, YOU CAN LOOK OUT FOR UPDATES THERE.
YOU1000000003_S0000166	TO CLOSE THINGS OFF HERE, I HAVE WITH ME LISHA LEE, WHO DID HER PHD WORK ON THE THEORETICAL SIDE OF DEEP LEARNING.
YOU1000000003_S0000167	AND WHO CURRENTLY WORKS AT A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM CALLED AMPLIFY PARTNERS, WHO KINDLY PROVIDED SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS VIDEO.
YOU1000000003_S0000168	SO, LEISHA, ONE THING I THINK WE SHOULD QUICKLY BRING UP IS THIS SIGMOID FUNCTION.
YOU1000000003_S0000169	AS I UNDERSTAND IT, EARLY NETWORKS USED THIS TO SQUISH THE RELEVANT WEIGHTED SUM INTO THAT INTERVAL BETWEEN 0 AND 1.
YOU1000000003_S0000170	YOU KNOW, KIND OF MOTIVATED BY THIS BIOLOGICAL ANALOGY OF NEURONS EITHER BEING INACTIVE OR ACTIVE.
YOU1000000003_S0000171	EXACTLY.
YOU1000000003_S0000172	BUT RELATIVELY FEW MODERN NETWORKS ACTUALLY USE SIGMOID ANYMORE. IT'S KIND OF OLD SCHOOL, RIGHT?
YOU1000000003_S0000173	YEAH, OR RATHER, RELU SEEMS TO BE MUCH EASIER TO TRAIN.
YOU1000000003_S0000174	AND RELU STANDS FOR RECTIFIED LINEAR UNIT.
YOU1000000003_S0000175	YES, IT'S THIS KIND OF FUNCTION WHERE YOU'RE JUST TAKING A MAX OF ZERO AND
YOU1000000003_S0000176	AND A, WHERE A IS GIVEN BY WHAT YOU WERE EXPLAINING IN THE VIDEO.
YOU1000000003_S0000177	AND WHAT THIS WAS SORT OF MOTIVATED FROM, I THINK, WAS PARTIALLY BY A BIOLOGICAL ANALOGY WITH HOW NEURONS WOULD EITHER BE ACTIVATED
YOU1000000003_S0000178	OR NOT, AND SO IF IT PASSES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD IT WOULD BE THE IDENTITY FUNCTION, BUT IF IT DID NOT THEN IT WOULD JUST NOT BE ACTIVATED, SO IT WOULD BE ZERO. SO IT'S KIND OF A SIMPLIFICATION.
YOU1000000003_S0000179	USING SIGMOIDS DIDN'T HELP TRAINING OR IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRAIN AT SOME POINT AND PEOPLE JUST TRIED RELU.
YOU1000000003_S0000180	AND IT HAPPENED TO WORK VERY WELL FOR THESE INCREDIBLY DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS.

YOU1000000005_S0000011	ALRIGHT, LET'S GET TO THE TUTORIAL. IT'S TIME TO LEARN ABOUT UTM CODES. SO IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A URL PATH THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS.
YOU1000000005_S0000012	THIS HAS UTM TRACKING INSIDE OF IT.
YOU1000000005_S0000013	UTM IS URGENT TRACKING MODULE. YOU'VE ALSO PROBABLY HEARD IT CALLED TRACKING PARAMETERS OR TRACKING TAGS.
YOU1000000005_S0000014	THESE UTM TAGS ALLOW US TO TRACK FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS. I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE.
YOU1000000005_S0000015	BUT LET'S BREAK DOWN THIS URL FIRST SO YOU KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.
YOU1000000005_S0000016	OBVIOUSLY, THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE ROOT DOMAIN NAME OR THE PAGE THAT YOU WANT THIS LINK TO GO TO.
YOU1000000005_S0000017	THEN YOU'VE GOT A UTM SOURCE LIVING INSIDE OF HERE. THIS IS THE FIRST PARAMETER THAT WE'RE USING.
YOU1000000005_S0000018	WE'RE ASKING FOR THE SOURCE OF THIS PARTICULAR LINK TRAFFIC, RIGHT?
YOU1000000005_S0000019	WHERE DID MY TRAFFIC COME FROM? WHERE'S THE SOURCE OF THIS TRAFFIC? WHERE WERE WE USING THIS LINK?
YOU1000000005_S0000020	THIS SAYS NEWSLETTER. YOU CAN TRACK ALL SORTS OF STUFF. HERE'S ANOTHER UTM PARAMETER SAYING THE UTM MEDIUM IS THE EMAIL.
YOU1000000005_S0000021	THE UTM CAMPAIGN IS THE SEO TIPS AND THE UTM CONTENT IS THE CALL TO ACTION BUTTON. YOU'VE GOT FIVE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS THAT YOU CAN TRACK.
YOU1000000005_S0000022	THOSE FIVE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS ARE CAMPAIGN SOURCE, CAMPAIGN MEDIUM, CAMPAIGN NAME, CAMPAIGN TERM,
YOU1000000005_S0000023	AND CAMPAIGN CONTENT. NOW, THIS PARTICULAR RESOURCE THAT I'M GIVING YOU IS ACTUALLY THE FREE RESOURCE THAT HELPS YOU BUILD THOSE URLS.
YOU1000000005_S0000024	EASILY AND QUICKLY, THEY TYPE IT ALL IN FOR YOU AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU DON'T MISS ANY CHARACTERS WHATSOEVER. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND FILL IN THE BLANKS HERE.
YOU1000000005_S0000025	AND IT'LL START TO BUILD IT FOR YOU. SO LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH FIRST OF ALL WHAT THEY ARE, AND THEN I'LL BUILD A SAMPLE URL. SO THE CAMPAIGN SOURCE.
YOU1000000005_S0000026	THIS IS REQUIRED IF WE'RE GOING TO USE ANY UTMS. THIS IS THE BASE ONE THAT WILL BE REQUIRED, THE MEDIUM IS REQUIRED, AND THE CAMPAIGN NAME.
YOU1000000005_S0000027	AND THEN THE TERM AND THE CONTENT WOULD BE OPTIONAL. BUT THE CAMPAIGN SOURCE IS USED TO IDENTIFY THE SEARCH ENGINE
YOU1000000005_S0000028	NEWSLETTER NAME OR OTHER SOURCE EXAMPLE GOOGLE RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO DO AN EXAMPLE UP HERE USING FACEBOOK THE CAMPAIGN MEDIUM
YOU1000000005_S0000029	THIS IS THE UTM MEDIUM USED TO IDENTIFY THE EMAIL OR MAYBE THE COST PER CLICK
YOU1000000005_S0000030	WHATEVER MEDIUM IS BEING USED INSIDE OF THAT SOURCE. SO FOR US, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE A REGULAR POST THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, RIGHT?
YOU1000000005_S0000031	AND THEN THIS IS ALSO THE ONE THAT'S REQUIRED, THE UTM CAMPAIGN. THIS IS USED TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR PROMOTION OR STRATEGIC CAMPAIGN.
YOU1000000005_S0000032	SO THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY'RE GIVING HERE IS SPRING SELL. SO YOU CAN USE SOMETHING IF YOU'RE RUNNING A CERTAIN CAMPAIGN FOR DONATIONS
YOU1000000005_S0000033	OR FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT THAT YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.
YOU1000000005_S0000034	THE CAMPAIGN TERM WOULD BE TO NOTE A KEYWORD FOR THIS AD. SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER A SPECIFIC KEY TERM, YOU CAN ADD THAT INSIDE OF THERE.
YOU1000000005_S0000035	AND THEN THE CAMPAIGN CONTENT, I THINK THIS ONE IS REALLY KEY TO USE AS WELL.
YOU1000000005_S0000036	BECAUSE THIS ONE ALLOWS YOU TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ADS OR LINKS IF THEY'RE IN THE SAME TYPE OF DOCUMENT.
YOU1000000005_S0000037	SO FOR LIKE AN EMAIL CAMPAIGN, IF YOU HAVE DIFFERENT LINKS.
YOU1000000005_S0000038	YOU CAN TRACK THE SPECIFIC LINK INSIDE THAT DOCUMENT THAT BROUGHT YOU THE MOST TRAFFIC. SO IT'S A REALLY COOL TOOL HERE.
YOU1000000005_S0000039	LET'S GO UP HERE AND BUILD ONE OUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO USE IT. SO, WEBSITE URL. THIS IS THE LINK THAT YOU WANT THEM TO LAND ON. SO IF YOU HAVE AN INTERNAL LANDING PAGE,
YOU1000000005_S0000040	THIS CAN GO ANYWHERE TO A ACTIVE LINK ONLINE. THE CAMPAIGN SOURCE FOR US RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND USE FACEBOOK.
YOU1000000005_S0000042	THE CAMPAIGN MEDIUM, SO THIS IS COST PER CLICK, BANNER, EMAIL, YOU CAN PUT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO INSIDE OF THERE. I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO LIST THE FACEBOOK PAGE.
YOU1000000005_S0000043	I'M GOING TO PUT THIS ON SO I CAN TRACK WHICHEVER PAGE THIS IS COMING FROM. SO I'M GOING TO SAY THIS IS COMING FROM ASK CORI PAGE.
YOU1000000005_S0000045	THEN THE CAMPAIGN NAME. REMEMBER, THESE ARE THE REQUIRED THREE FIELDS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AFTER YOUR URL.
YOU1000000005_S0000046	SO WE'VE GOT TO FILL IT OUT AND PUT SOMETHING IN THERE THAT MAKES SENSE FOR US IS THIS A PRODUCT IS THIS A PROMO CODE IS THERE A SLOGAN.
YOU1000000005_S0000047	AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO PUT IN HERE TO HELP US AGAIN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS TRAFFIC IS COMING FROM? I'M GOING TO PUT ON HERE SEO TIPS.
YOU1000000005_S0000049	AND THEN YOU CAN ADD IN KEYWORDS AND YOU CAN ADD IN CAMPAIGN CONTENT IF YOU WANT TO DIFFERENTIATE THOSE ADS.
YOU1000000005_S0000050	AND FOR THIS ONE, I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY THAT THIS ONE WAS AN ORGANIC AD THAT BASICALLY I DIDN'T PROMOTE.
YOU1000000005_S0000051	THIS IS JUST AN ORGANIC AD THAT I WAS JUST GONNA POST ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE. THAT'S IT, YOU GUYS. IT HAS BUILT OUT THE LINK FOR ME.

YOU1000000005_S0000054	BUT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED. SO BASICALLY, YOU JUST NEED TO LOG IN CREATE AN ACCOUNT.
YOU1000000005_S0000055	BUT FOR FREE, WE CAN GRAB THIS LINK RIGHT HERE AND WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING. WE CAN PUT THAT BEHIND A TEXT LINK, BEHIND AN IMAGE.
YOU1000000005_S0000056	WE CAN PUT IT IN A POST, IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE CAN USE IT ANYWHERE WE WANT AND IT ALLOWS US TO COMPLETELY TRACK WHERE THAT TRAFFIC CAME FROM.
YOU1000000005_S0000057	SO, LET'S TAKE THAT LINK AND JUMP INTO OUR FACEBOOK. HERE I AM INSIDE OF MY FACEBOOK PAGE FOR COREY ASHLEY.

YOU1000000010_S0000004	HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION THAT SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING IS LIVE, ONLY TO JOIN THAT LIVE SESSION.
YOU1000000010_S0000005	AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS SHARING OUT THE LIVE STREAM TO OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. SO SHARING IT TO THEIR FACEBOOK GROUP OR TO A PAGE OR TO ANY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA.
YOU1000000010_S0000006	THE TIME TO CAPTURE YOUR AUDIENCE WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A LIVE STREAM IS IMMEDIATELY.
YOU1000000010_S0000007	YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE TO MAKE YOUR AUDIENCE WAIT. JUST WAIT A MINUTE WHILE I SHARE THIS OUT TO MY PAGE, TO MY GROUP, TO MY TWITTER ACCOUNT. YOU NEED TO CAPTURE YOUR AUDIENCE STRAIGHT AWAY.
YOU1000000010_S0000008	WELL, NOW THERE IS A WAY TO AUTOMATE THIS PROCESS SO THAT YOU'RE NOT LOSING THOSE PRECIOUS FIRST SECONDS FROM YOUR TRUE FANS THAT JUMP ON IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU'RE LIVE.
YOU1000000010_S0000009	IN THIS VIDEO, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE TOOL YOU NEED TO DO IT AND TAKE YOU THROUGH STEP BY STEP HOW YOU CAN SET IT UP FOR MAXIMUM RESULTS ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS.
YOU1000000010_S0000010	AND STICK AROUND TO THE END, BECAUSE I'M ALSO GONNA SHARE WITH YOU ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE USE TO HELP NOTIFY OUR SUBSCRIBERS LONG BEFORE OUR LIVE STREAMS EVEN START.
YOU1000000010_S0000011	OKAY, SO NOW ONTO THIS AMAZING FACEBOOK LIVE AUTOMATION TOOL. IT WAS ACTUALLY INTRODUCED TO ME BY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, JASON EVERETT, SO MAKE SURE YOU CHECK HIM OUT AT JASONEVERETT.COM.
YOU1000000010_S0000012	BUT THE TOOL IS CALLED LIVELEAP. AND AGAIN, ALL THE LINKS TO EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE YOU CAN FIND LINKED IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW.
YOU1000000010_S0000013	LIVELEAP IS AN AWESOME SERVICE THAT SYNDICATES OUT YOUR FACEBOOK LIVES THE MOMENT THAT YOU GO LIVE.
YOU1000000010_S0000014	TO PLACES LIKE FACEBOOK GROUPS, FACEBOOK PAGES, TO TWITTER, TO LINKEDIN ACCOUNTS, OUT THROUGH EMAIL AND SMS AS WELL.
YOU1000000010_S0000015	SO IN ORDER FOR YOU TO REACH ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS OR DIFFERENT AUDIENCES WITHOUT LIVE LEAP, IT WOULD TAKE YOU A LONG TIME ONCE YOU WENT LIVE.
YOU1000000010_S0000016	SO TO AUTOMATE THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS JUST AMAZING. SO THIS IS A REAL GAME CHANGER WHEN IT COMES TO FACEBOOK LIVE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
YOU1000000010_S0000017	THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO AUTOMATICALLY SYNDICATE YOUR FACEBOOK LIVE OUT ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS, BUT EVEN INTERNALLY, JUST IN FACEBOOK.
YOU1000000010_S0000018	TO SHARE IT OUT AUTOMATICALLY TO A FACEBOOK GROUP, A PAGE, OR MULTIPLE GROUPS, OR MULTIPLE PAGES, THE INSTANT YOU GO LIVE IS REALLY, REALLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000010_S0000019	SO TO SET THIS UP, YOU WILL NEED TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT AND THEY DO HAVE A $1 SEVEN DAY TRIAL PERIOD.
YOU1000000010_S0000020	SO YOU CAN TRY IT FOR SEVEN DAYS FOR $1. AND AGAIN, CHECK OUT THE LINKS IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW. SO ONCE YOU'VE CREATED YOUR LIVELEAP ACCOUNT, YOU'LL NEED TO SIGN IN USING YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT.
YOU1000000010_S0000021	ONCE YOU'RE IN, THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE PRESENTED WITH. THIS IS THE LIVE LEAP DASHBOARD.
YOU1000000010_S0000022	NOW ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE HERE IS THE MAIN MENU, SO IF WE CLICK ON LIVE BROADCAST, THAT'LL SHOW YOU ALL YOUR PREVIOUS BROADCASTS THAT YOU'VE SYNDICATED OUT USING LIVELEAP.
YOU1000000010_S0000023	BUT THE NEXT ONE DOWN, FACEBOOK ROUTE MANAGER, IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN SET UP ROUTES, OR WHERE YOU WANT YOUR FACEBOOK LIVES TO BE SYNDICATED OUT TO.
YOU1000000010_S0000024	SO WE'LL CREATE A NEW RULE HERE, A NEW ROUTE. SO THIS PAGE IS THE FIRST STEP HERE IN THIS FIVE STEP SETUP PROCESS.
YOU1000000010_S0000025	AND THIS IS WHERE WE SET UP SHARE BROADCASTS FROM THESE PAGES. SO WE'LL GIVE IT A NAME, SHARE JUSTIN LIVE.
YOU1000000010_S0000027	DO YOU WANNA SHARE THE LIVE VIDEOS THAT YOU PUBLISH FROM YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE?
YOU1000000010_S0000029	YES. WHICH FACEBOOK PAGES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE YOUR LIVE VIDEOS FROM?
YOU1000000010_S0000030	NOW IF YOU ONLY WANNA SHARE YOUR LIVE VIDEOS OUT AND SYNDICATE THEM FROM YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE, THEN THAT'S ALL YOU'LL NEED TO PICK.
YOU1000000010_S0000031	IF YOU WANNA SYNDICATE OUT WHEN YOU GO LIVE TO A PAGE THAT YOU'RE AN ADMIN ON OR A MANAGER ON AS WELL, THEN YOU CAN PICK THOSE PAGES HERE.
YOU1000000010_S0000032	SO I WILL SYNDICATE OUT OUR LIVE STREAMS FROM OUR PRIMAL VIDEO FACEBOOK PAGE AS WELL. SO I'LL SELECT THAT ONE AND CHOOSE NEXT.
YOU1000000010_S0000034	NOW, SHARE TO THESE PAGES AND GROUPS. WHERE DO WE WANT THESE TO GO? DO YOU WANT TO SHARE LIVE VIDEOS TO YOUR PERSONAL PROFILE?
YOU1000000010_S0000035	SO IF WE TURN THIS ON, EVEN THOUGH WE ALREADY HAD OUR PERSONAL PROFILE TICKED ON THE PAGE BEFORE,
YOU1000000010_S0000036	THIS MEANS THAT IF WE GO LIVE ON EITHER OUR PERSONAL PROFILE OR THE PAGE, THEY WILL BE SYNDICATED TO THE OTHER AS WELL. AND LIKEWISE,
YOU1000000010_S0000037	WHAT PAGES WOULD WE LIKE TO SYNDICATE OUR FACEBOOK LIVE TO.
YOU1000000010_S0000039	JUSTIN BROWN PRIMAL VIDEO. WE'LL SEND IT THERE AS WELL WHEN WE GO LIVE. SO THAT WAY IF WE'RE LIVE ON OUR PERSONAL PROFILE, IT'S GONNA GO TO THE PAGE. IF WE'RE LIVE ON THE PAGE, IT'S GONNA GO TO THE PROFILE.
YOU1000000010_S0000040	SO YOU CAN ALREADY SEE THE LEVEL OF CONTROL YOU GET OVER THIS SYNDICATION. YOU CAN PICK MULTIPLE PAGES IF YOU NEED TO TO REALLY SHARE YOUR LIVE STREAMS OUT.
YOU1000000010_S0000041	AND HERE YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE WHICH GROUPS YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR LIVE VIDEOS TO.
YOU1000000010_S0000042	SO IF YOU'RE AN ADMIN ON A GROUP OR A GROUP OWNER, THEN YOU'LL HAVE THE CHOICE TO PICK YOUR GROUPS DOWN THE BOTTOM HERE.
YOU1000000010_S0000043	AND WE GO NEXT. NEXT UP, WE CAN SELECT NETWORKS OUTSIDE OF FACEBOOK THAT WE WANNA BROADCAST AND SYNDICATE OUR FACEBOOK LIVES TO.
YOU1000000010_S0000044	SO YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT TWITTER AND LINKEDIN HERE. YOU NEED TO CONNECT YOUR ACCOUNT FIRST BY CLICKING THE CLICK HERE TO CONNECT YOUR ACCOUNT ON BOTH TWITTER AND LINKEDIN IF YOU WANT.
YOU1000000010_S0000045	YOU CAN SEE I'VE ALREADY GOT MY TWITTER LINKED UP, JUSTINBROWNPV. IF I WANT TO BROADCAST TO THERE, THEN I'LL ENABLE THAT HERE.
YOU1000000010_S0000046	AND EXACTLY THE SAME FOR LINKEDIN. YOU'LL HAVE TO CONNECT YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU WANNA BROADCAST TO LINKEDIN AS WELL. THEN HIT NEXT.
YOU1000000010_S0000047	NOW THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY INTERESTING AND SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T SEE TOO OFTEN. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHARE YOUR FACEBOOK LIVE BROADCAST OUT VIA SMS.
YOU1000000010_S0000048	SO YOU CAN UPLOAD A CSV FILE WITH YOUR SMS CONTACTS OR AN EMAIL LIST.
YOU1000000010_S0000049	SO YOU CAN UPLOAD YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS LIST INTO THIS AREA AS WELL. AND IF WE JUST CLICK ON THAT NOW, YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S LOOKING FOR A CSV FILE.
YOU1000000010_S0000051	SO WE'LL SKIP THAT ONE FOR NOW. AND THE LAST INTEGRATIONS YOU GET HERE, YOU CAN SEND LIVE NOTIFICATIONS TO WEBSITES AND MULTIPLE WEBSITES.
YOU1000000010_S0000052	SO WE CAN CLICK HERE AND ADD A WEBSITE. YOU'LL GO THROUGH, NAME YOUR WEBSITE, GIVE ALL YOUR LINKS. YOU CAN SET WHAT THE NOTIFICATION'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE.
YOU1000000010_S0000053	THEN YOU PASTE THIS CODE INTO YOUR WEBSITE SO WHENEVER YOU'RE LIVE, THERE'S A NOTIFICATION THAT POPS UP ON YOUR WEBSITE.
YOU1000000010_S0000054	SAYING THAT YOU'RE LIVE AS WELL. SO THAT IS REALLY POWERFUL. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT I'VE GOT THIS SET UP ON OUR PRIMALVIDEO.COM WEBSITE, SO I CAN ENABLE THAT HERE NOW TOO.
YOU1000000010_S0000055	AND THE LAST ONE HERE IS WEBHOOK INTEGRATION. SO IF YOU'VE GOT ANY WEBHOOKS THAT ARE SET UP FOR ANY SERVICES OR ANY OTHER PLATFORMS THAT YOU'RE RUNNING,
YOU1000000010_S0000056	THEN YOU CAN SET THOSE UP IN HERE AS WELL. AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THAT SET UP, JUST CLICK FINISH, AND THAT'S IT. IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.
YOU1000000010_S0000057	NOW IT'S SET UP SO ANYTIME I GO LIVE ON EITHER MY PERSONAL PROFILE OR A FACEBOOK PAGE, YOU CAN SEE HERE, SHARE FROM PERSONAL PROFILE.
YOU1000000010_S0000058	OR ONE FACEBOOK PAGE, WHICH WAS THE PRIMAL VIDEO FACEBOOK PAGE, IT'S GOING TO SHARE TO PERSONAL, IT'S GONNA SHARE TO THAT FACEBOOK PRIMAL VIDEO PAGE.
YOU1000000010_S0000059	IT'S ALSO GONNA SHARE TO MY TWITTER AND TO OUR PRIMAL VIDEO WEBSITE AS WELL.
YOU1000000010_S0000060	NOW YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE PAGES, MULTIPLE GROUPS, MULTIPLE TWITTER ACCOUNTS, AND MULTIPLE WEBSITES IN HERE AS WELL. THE ONLY THING YOU CAN'T HAVE MULTIPLES OF IS PERSONAL ACCOUNTS.
YOU1000000010_S0000061	YOUR LIVELIP ACCOUNT IS LINKED HERE TO YOUR PERSONAL FACEBOOK PROFILE. SO AT THIS POINT YOU CAN'T BROADCAST TO MULTIPLE PROFILES.
YOU1000000010_S0000062	BUT REALLY WHO HAS MULTIPLE PROFILES ANYWAY? AND EVEN MORE ADVANCED THAN THIS IS YOU CAN CREATE MULTIPLE ROUTES. YOU CAN SEE WE'VE JUST GOT ONE HERE.
YOU1000000010_S0000063	WE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE ROUTES TO BROADCAST DIFFERENT THINGS OUT TO DIFFERENT PLATFORMS AND DIFFERENT AREAS. SO IT'S REALLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000010_S0000064	THE ONLY OTHER SETTINGS YOU'VE GOT IN HERE ARE ADVANCED SETTINGS FOR EMAIL AND FOR TEXT AND SMS SETTINGS AS WELL.
YOU1000000010_S0000065	SO YOU CAN SEE HERE YOU CAN LINK IT UP TO YOUR SENDGRID ACCOUNT THROUGH A SENDGRID API AND THAT WOULD BE HOW IT'S SENDING THE EMAILS OUT AND MORE ADVANCED SETTINGS FOR YOUR SMS BROADCAST AS WELL.
YOU1000000010_S0000066	BUT IF YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT SMS OR EMAIL, THEN YOU CAN IGNORE THESE ALTOGETHER. THE KEY AREA THAT YOU WANNA SET UP HERE IS THE FACEBOOK ROUTE MANAGER.
YOU1000000010_S0000067	NOW THE LAST THING THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING IS, THIS SOUNDS AMAZING, HOW MUCH DOES IT ACTUALLY COST? I KNOW I CAN GET A SEVEN DAY TRIAL FOR A DOLLAR, BUT HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO KEEP USING IT?
YOU1000000010_S0000068	WELL, THERE'S TWO PLANS. THERE'S A BASIC PLAN AT $19 PER MONTH, WHICH IS GOING TO DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE AFTER. AND THERE'S A PRO PLAN AT $49 PER MONTH.
YOU1000000010_S0000069	THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PLANS IS THE NUMBER OF USERS YOU CAN HAVE. YOU'VE GOT ONE USER ON THE BASIC PLAN AND THREE USERS ON THE PRO PLAN.
YOU1000000010_S0000070	YOU'LL HAVE MORE ADVANCED TRAINING ON THE PRO PLAN AS WELL, AND IT'S GOT ALPHA ACCESS TO PAGE BUILDER.
YOU1000000010_S0000071	AND IT SAYS THAT PAGE BUILDER AUTOMATICALLY CREATES VIDEO REPLAY PAGES AND HAS A VARIETY OF FEATURES FOR MARKETING.
YOU1000000010_S0000072	SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN THE PRO PLAN IS FOR YOU. IF NOT, AT LEAST START OUT WITH THE BASIC $19 PER MONTH AND THAT WILL DO MOST THINGS THAT YOU'RE AFTER.
YOU1000000010_S0000073	BUT GRAB THE $1 SEVEN DAY TRIAL AND SEE HOW THIS WORKS FOR YOU.
YOU1000000010_S0000074	BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. THIS IS REALLY A GAME CHANGING SERVICE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE CREATE THEIR FACEBOOK LIVES.
YOU1000000010_S0000075	SO THAT'S HOW YOU CAN SET UP THE AUTOMATIC SYNDICATION OF YOUR FACEBOOK LIVES.
YOU1000000010_S0000076	TO GO OUT TO MULTIPLE FACEBOOK GROUPS, MULTIPLE FACEBOOK PAGES, MULTIPLE PLATFORMS, TWITTER, LINKEDIN, YOUR WEBSITE, ALL USING LIVELEAP.
YOU1000000010_S0000077	NOW THE OTHER TOOL THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE VIDEO THAT WE USE TO NOTIFY OUR SUBSCRIBERS, OUR FANS, OUR FOLLOWERS.
YOU1000000010_S0000078	THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO LIVE BEFORE WE'RE ACTUALLY LIVE IS CALLED SEND CALENDAR.
YOU1000000010_S0000079	THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE IN AND ATTENDING YOUR FACEBOOK LIVES IS TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH NOTICE AS YOU CAN. AND THAT'S WHAT SEND CALENDAR ALLOWS YOU TO DO.
YOU1000000010_S0000080	IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET YOUR LIVE STREAMS INTO THEIR CALENDAR. SO THAT'S THEIR CALENDAR ON THEIR PHONE, ON THEIR COMPUTER.
YOU1000000010_S0000081	THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS CALENDAR THAT THEY'RE USING EVERY DAY TO SCHEDULE THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES.
YOU1000000010_S0000082	IF YOU CAN GET YOUR LIVE STREAMS INTO THERE, THEN IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THEY'LL SHOW UP AND ATTEND YOUR LIVE STREAM.
YOU1000000010_S0000083	WE DID DO A VIDEO ON SEND CALENDAR A LITTLE WHILE BACK, AND I'LL LINK IT UP IN THE CARDS NOW, SO MAKE SURE YOU CHECK IT OUT.
YOU1000000010_S0000084	IF YOU WANNA SEE HOW POWERFUL IT IS GETTING YOUR LIVE STREAMS INTO YOUR AUDIENCE'S CALENDARS.
YOU1000000010_S0000085	IF YOU FOUND THIS VIDEO HELPFUL, THEN MAKE SURE YOU CLICK THAT BIG SUBSCRIBE BUTTON IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, AND GIVE THIS VIDEO A THUMBS UP.

YOU1000000015_S0000004	AND REPURPOSE FROM YOUR IPHONE OR IPAD, UNFORTUNATELY THE PROCESS IS NOT AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS IT CAN BE. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE ARE A FEW OPTIONS TO DO IT.
YOU1000000015_S0000005	AND WE'RE GONNA RUN THROUGH THE BEST ONES RIGHT NOW. NOW EACH OPTION DOES HAVE ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, SO STICK AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE USING THE BEST OPTION FOR YOU.
YOU1000000015_S0000006	SO THE FIRST OPTION I'M GONNA TAKE YOU THROUGH IS SOLELY GOING TO USE YOUR IPHONE OR YOUR IPAD WITH NO NEED TO USE A COMPUTER OR A LAPTOP.
YOU1000000015_S0000007	TO BE ABLE TO HELP IN THE PROCESS. OKAY, SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO OPEN UP FACEBOOK AND TO GO AND FIND THE VIDEOS THAT YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD.
YOU1000000015_S0000008	SO FOR THIS I'M JUST GONNA GO TO OUR PRIMAL VIDEO PAGE.
YOU1000000015_S0000009	AND I'LL COME ACROSS HERE TO VIDEOS, FIND THE VIDEO THAT I WANT TO DOWNLOAD. LET'S SAY THIS ONE HERE. IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO GROW ON YOUTUBE. LET'S PRESS ON THAT.
YOU1000000015_S0000010	AND THEN WE NEED TO GRAB THE LINK FOR THAT VIDEO. SO WE COME DOWN TO SHARE, AS IF WE'RE GONNA SHARE THIS OUT. COME DOWN TO MORE OPTIONS, AND YOU WANNA CHOOSE COPY.
YOU1000000015_S0000011	SO THAT WE'RE COPYING THE LINK TO THAT VIDEO. NEXT, YOU'LL NEED TO COME ACROSS TO THE APP STORE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE FIREFOX INSTALLED.
YOU1000000015_S0000012	SO FIREFOX IS AN ALTERNATIVE WEB BROWSER TO GOOGLE CHROME OR SAFARI, BUT THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THAT FIREFOX WILL LET YOU DOWNLOAD THESE VIDEOS
YOU1000000015_S0000013	FROM THAT VIDEO LINK. SO YOU CAN SEE I'VE ALREADY GOT IT INSTALLED, SO I'M JUST GONNA HIT OPEN ON THIS, AND FIREFOX IS TOTALLY FREE AND IT IS SAFE TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL AND HAVE ON YOUR DEVICE.
YOU1000000015_S0000014	SO THE NEXT THING I WANNA DO IS TO OPEN UP FIREFOX AND HEAD OVER TO ONE OF THESE TWO WEBSITES.
YOU1000000015_S0000015	EITHER FBDOWNLOAD.IO OR FBDOWN.NET. CURRENTLY, THESE ARE THE TWO MOST POPULAR ONES, AND EITHER ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO GIVE YOU GREAT RESULTS.
YOU1000000015_S0000016	MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS FBDOWNLOAD.IO, SO I'M GONNA HEAD THERE NOW. AND ALL WE NEED TO DO IS TO PASTE THAT LINK THAT WE'VE JUST COPIED INTO THIS TEXT FIELD HERE.
YOU1000000015_S0000017	SO WE PRESS AND HOLD AND THEN HIT PASTE. THERE IS OUR VIDEO LINK THAT WE HAD COPIED. WE PRESS DOWNLOAD AND WE WAIT A FEW SECONDS.
YOU1000000015_S0000018	AS IT'S GENERATING OUR DOWNLOAD LINKS. PLEASE WAIT. AND AS WE SCROLL DOWN HERE, YOU CAN SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE'VE GOT FOR DOWNLOADING OUR VIDEOS.
YOU1000000015_S0000019	WE GET THE CHOICE OF WHETHER WE WANT THE HD VERSION, AN SD VERSION, OR ONE OF THE LOWER QUALITY VERSIONS, OR EVEN AUDIO ONLY. SO IT'S NORMALLY GOING TO BE THE TOP ONE THAT YOU'LL WANT. THAT'S NORMALLY THE BEST QUALITY.
YOU1000000015_S0000020	AND YOU CAN SEE THE FILE SIZE THERE, 16.69 MEG, IS MUCH HIGHER THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER ONES THERE. SO THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE WANT. WE JUST PRESS AND HOLD ON THAT DOWNLOAD BUTTON.
YOU1000000015_S0000022	AND THEN WE GET THE OPTION HERE TO DOWNLOAD LINK. SO IF WE PRESS ON DOWNLOAD LINK, WE THEN GET THE OPTION HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FILE. SO WE PRESS DOWNLOAD NOW.
YOU1000000015_S0000023	THAT'S GONNA GO THROUGH AND THAT'S GOING TO DOWNLOAD THAT FILE. OKAY, SO YOU CAN SEE THE FILE IS FINISHED DOWNLOADING NOW. SO IF WE PRESS ON DOWNLOADS, SO WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS PRESS ON THAT, BECAUSE IT'S CURRENTLY NOT GONNA SHOW UP.
YOU1000000015_S0000024	IN OUR CAMERA ROLL OR IN OUR GALLERY. SO WE WANNA PRESS ON THAT AND THEN WE WANNA CHOOSE SAVE VIDEO. AND THAT'S NOW GONNA SAVE IT ACROSS INTO OUR PHOTOS.
YOU1000000015_S0000025	SO WE CAN COME BACK HERE TO PHOTOS AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THAT VIDEO IS IN THERE NOW.
YOU1000000015_S0000026	SO THAT'S OPTION ONE AND YOU CAN SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO DOWNLOAD YOUR VIDEOS DIRECTLY INTO YOUR IPAD OR INTO YOUR IPHONE JUST USING THAT FIREFOX APP.
YOU1000000015_S0000027	NOW THIS WILL ONLY WORK FOR VIDEOS THAT ARE PUBLIC ON FACEBOOK.
YOU1000000015_S0000028	IF THEY'RE INSIDE OF A CLOSED OR PRIVATE GROUP, THEN THIS OPTION MAY NOT WORK. OR IF THE PRIVACY IS SET TO NOT BE PUBLIC, THEN THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK EITHER.
YOU1000000015_S0000029	NOW WHILE THIS METHOD DOES LET YOU DOWNLOAD A DECENT QUALITY VERSION OF THAT VIDEO FROM FACEBOOK, IT'S NOT THE BEST QUALITY THAT YOU CAN GET.
YOU1000000015_S0000030	IN ORDER TO GET THE BEST QUALITY VIDEOS DOWNLOADED FROM FACEBOOK, YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO USE YOUR MAC OR YOUR PC, AND YOU WANNA DOWNLOAD THE FILE ON THERE.
YOU1000000015_S0000031	AND THEN TRANSFER IT ACROSS TO YOUR IPHONE OR IPAD. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THIS METHOD NOW. NOW THE BEST TOOL THAT I'VE FOUND TO DO THIS IS CALLED PARALLELS TOOLBOX.
YOU1000000015_S0000032	AND IT'S AVAILABLE FOR BOTH MAC AND WINDOWS. DOES COST $19.99 FOR THE YEAR FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TO THIS SOFTWARE, BUT IS SO MUCH MORE.
YOU1000000015_S0000033	THAN JUST VIDEO DOWNLOADING SOFTWARE. SO IF I BRING IT UP NOW, YOU CAN SEE YOU'VE GOT OPTIONS FOR DO NOT DISTURB MODE, PRESENTATION MODE, YOU'VE GOT THE ABILITY TO HIDE YOUR DESKTOP.
YOU1000000015_S0000034	IF YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING A SCREEN SHARE OR A SCREEN RECORDING, YOU CAN REMOVE ALL THE CLUTTER AND MESS ON YOUR DESKTOP TO MAKE IT LOOK CLEANER. YOU'VE GOT AN AEROPLANE MODE, YOU'VE GOT OPTIONS IN HERE TO CLEAN UP YOUR HARD DRIVE.
YOU1000000015_S0000035	IF YOU'VE GOT A VIDEO CONVERTER IN HERE, AN ANIMATED GIF OR GIF MAKER, THERE IS A HEAP OF TOOLS IN HERE AND THESE GUYS ARE ACTIVELY ADDING NEW ONES.
YOU1000000015_S0000036	IN HERE ALL THE TIME. BUT THE ONE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE DOWNLOAD VIDEO TOOL. AND THIS IS WHAT POPS UP WHEN YOU OPEN IT. SO WHAT YOU WANNA DO FIRST IS JUST CHECK THAT YOUR SETTINGS ARE SET ACCORDINGLY.
YOU1000000015_S0000037	ACCORDINGLY. YOU CAN SEE HERE YOU CAN CHOOSE THE PREFERRED QUALITY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT ON MAX OR MAXIMUM AVAILABLE, BUT YOU CAN ALSO SELECT LOWER QUALITY VERSIONS AS WELL.
YOU1000000015_S0000038	AS WELL. IF YOU ARE DOWNLOADING A NON MP4 VIDEO, SO A VIDEO THAT'S IN A DIFFERENT FILE FORMAT, YOU CAN HAVE IT
YOU1000000015_S0000039	DOWNLOAD AND CONVERT INTO AN MP4 ALL WITHIN THIS APP AS WELL. SO FOR US, WE'RE GONNA DOWNLOAD WITHOUT CONVERSION.
YOU1000000015_S0000040	YOU ALSO GET TO SPECIFY YOUR DOWNLOAD LOCATION. SO HERE I'M ON A MAC, IT'S JUST GONNA GO TO DOWNLOADS. WE'LL HIT DONE AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW THIS WORKS.
YOU1000000015_S0000041	SO WE WANNA COME ACROSS TO THAT SAME FACEBOOK PAGE, OUR FACEBOOK PAGE, LET'S PICK THE SAME VIDEO. IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO GROW ON YOUTUBE, WE'LL SELECT THAT.
YOU1000000015_S0000042	LET'S PAUSE IT SO IT DOESN'T PLAY. NOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE IS TO GRAB THAT LINK AGAIN. SO HERE WE DON'T NEED TO HIT SHARE, IT'S ACTUALLY AT THE TOP HERE, THE URL, WE CAN JUST COPY THAT.
YOU1000000015_S0000043	OR IF YOU'RE NOT SEEING THAT, YOU CAN RIGHT CLICK ON ANY VIDEO AND CHOOSE SHOW VIDEO URL AND THIS IS THE LINK HERE. SO YOU WANNA SELECT THAT, RIGHT CLICK AND CHOOSE COPY.
YOU1000000015_S0000044	OR PRESS CONTROL C OR COMMAND C TO COPY THAT LINK. YOU THEN WANNA COME BACK TO PARALLELS TOOLBOX AND THEN ALL WE NEED TO DO IS HIT PASTE.
YOU1000000015_S0000045	AND THAT'S GOING TO DOWNLOAD THAT VIDEO FOR US.
YOU1000000015_S0000047	AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THE FILE SIZE IS A LITTLE BIT LARGER AT 17.5 MEGABYTES. SO IT IS SLIGHTLY BETTER QUALITY. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT YOUR DOWNLOAD IS COMPLETED DOWN HERE.
YOU1000000015_S0000048	ON YOUR COMPUTER UNDER DOWNLOADS OR WHEREVER IT IS THAT YOU'VE SET IT TO SAVE. SO FROM THERE, ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE FILE SAVED ON YOUR COMPUTER, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TO TRANSFER IT.

YOU1000000019_S0000006	IF YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT. ANYWAYS, MOVING ON, THE VALK 3 MEASURES 55.5 MILLIMETERS ACROSS. I KIND OF FEEL LIKE THAT WAS PLANNED A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000019_S0000007	BUT I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE. THE STOCK STICKERS ARE LABELED AS THE QI HALF BRIGHT SHADES, BUT THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL TO Q SMITH HALF BRIGHTS.
YOU1000000019_S0000008	WHICH IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T KNOW, WERE THE SHADES THAT EVERYONE USED TO USE BEFORE THE CUBICLE STICKERS BECAME POPULAR. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TURNING.
YOU1000000019_S0000009	OUT OF THE BOX, THE VALK3 REMINDED ME OF A YU GI OH! A BIT. WHEN I OPENED UP THE CUBES TO COMPARE THE MECHANISMS, I WAS ACTUALLY VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THEY WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL, SEEMINGLY.
YOU1000000019_S0000010	EVEN MOYU POSTED SOME PHOTOS OF THE YU XIAO AND THE VALK3 NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND THE MECHANISMS LOOK PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.
YOU1000000019_S0000011	BUT SHE THEN WENT ON TO POST SOME MORE PHOTOS AND EXPLAIN SOME MORE OF THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO CUBES.
YOU1000000019_S0000012	AND OF COURSE, FEELING A BROKEN IN YUXIAO AND A BROKEN IN VOLK3, THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH NOTHING ALIKE. THE VOLK3 IS PRETTY MUCH ENTIRELY SMOOTH. THERE ARE NO BUMPS OR ANYTHING ALONG THE TURN.
YOU1000000019_S0000013	IT'S JUST COMPLETELY SMOOTH. IT'S ALSO VERY LIGHT AND VERY FAST. VERY LITTLE EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO START A TURN, SO THE CUBE IS BEST SUITED FOR A LIGHT, ACCURATE TURN STYLE.
YOU1000000019_S0000014	WHEN TURNING FAST, THE CUBE DOES BECOME A BIT CLICKY AND HAS A VERY RIGID FEEL. IN GENERAL, THE CUBE IS EASY TO CONTROL ON TIGHT TENSIONS, BUT SOMETIMES I DO LOSE CONTROL AND OVERSHOOT.
YOU1000000019_S0000015	CAUSING A LOCKUP. ALTHOUGH THIS MOSTLY HAPPENS WHEN I'M SPAMMING TPS IN THE LAST LAYER, SO I'VE HAD TO LEARN TO CONTROL MY SPEED TO HELP WITH OVERSHOOTING.
YOU1000000019_S0000016	AND IN GENERAL I'VE JUST HAD TO ADJUST MY TURNING STYLE QUITE A BIT TO DO WELL WITH THIS CUBE. SINCE I'VE BEEN USING THE OUTLONG V2 AS MY MAIN, I WOULD SAY I'VE ADAPTED MORE OF A HARSHER TURN STYLE.
YOU1000000019_S0000017	AS THE L1V2 IS VERY FORGIVING, BUT IT'S ALSO NOT SUPER FAST, SO YOU CAN TURN VERY ROUGH AND YOU WON'T LOCK UP BASICALLY.
YOU1000000019_S0000018	BUT IF YOU USE THAT TURNSTILE WITH A VALK, IT JUST LOCKS UP COMPLETELY. SO I'VE HAD TO WORK ON ADJUSTING MY TURNSTILE TO BE A BIT SLOWER, A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE.
YOU1000000019_S0000019	BUT WITH A BIT OF PRACTICE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY TIMES BACK DOWN TO WHAT THEY USUALLY ARE AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED GETTING LOCKUPS. THE CORNER CUTTING ON THE VALK IS UP TO PAR WITH ANY MODERN SPEEDCUBE.
YOU1000000019_S0000020	ALTHOUGH I DID NOTICE AFTER TIGHTENING THE TENSIONS IT WAS MUCH HARDER TO CUT PAST 45. SAME WITH REVERSE, BUT SMALLER CUTS WERE JUST FINE.
YOU1000000019_S0000021	THE CUBE HOWEVER JUST FEELS A BIT MORE RIGID AND STURDY THAN OTHER 3X3'S WHICH I REALLY LIKE. IT'S A VERY STABLE PUZZLE, IT'S JUST NOT AS FORGIVING AS SOME OTHER 3X3'S.
YOU1000000019_S0000022	POPPING AND CORNER TWISTING OF COURSE NEVER HAPPEN ON THIS CUBE. THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT IN REVIEWS ANYMORE BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH ALL CUBES HAVE THOSE TRAITS.
YOU1000000019_S0000023	OVERALL THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VALK3 IS REALLY REALLY GOOD, BUT THERE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS THAT BUG ME ABOUT IT THAT I'M JUST NOT A HUGE FAN OF. FIRST OF ALL THE SIZE.
YOU1000000019_S0000024	THE 55.5MM IS JUST A LITTLE TOO SMALL FOR ME. I DO PREFER 57MM CUBES, MAINLY BECAUSE MY HANDS ARE REALLY BIG.
YOU1000000019_S0000025	AND I ACTUALLY FOUND MY FINGERS GETTING CAUGHT ON THE LAYERS SOMETIMES, ESPECIALLY DOING M TURNS. I JUST NOTICED THAT TO HAPPEN. IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL THOUGH.
YOU1000000019_S0000026	I'M
YOU1000000019_S0000027	THE CUBE JUST GLIDES SO EFFORTLESSLY, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO CONTROL SOMETIMES. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I'VE GOTTEN USED TO OVER TIME AND I'M STARTING TO ACTUALLY ENJOY NOW, BUT I STILL THOUGHT I'D BRING IT UP.
YOU1000000019_S0000028	FINALLY, THE SQUARED OFF CORNERS. NOW, I SAY THIS IN EVERY REVIEW, I DON'T REALLY LIKE SQUARED OFF CORNERS. FOR ME, THEY JUST CAUSE TOO MUCH CATCHING AND I DON'T REALLY CORNER TWIST EITHER WAY.
YOU1000000019_S0000029	SO IT'S NOT REALLY AN ADVANTAGE FOR ME. BUT THIS CUBE IN PARTICULAR I FELT HAS A BIGGER CATCHING ISSUE.
YOU1000000019_S0000030	I'M NOT SURE WHY, BUT I NOTICED THE CORNER CATCHING ON THE CENTER MORE OFTEN THAN WITH OTHER SQUARED OFF CORNER PUZZLES. I JUST THINK THAT IF THE CORNERS WERE ROUNDED OFF, ALL OF THE CATCHING PROBLEMS WOULD PRETTY MUCH DISAPPEAR.
YOU1000000019_S0000031	ONCE AGAIN, I'VE PRETTY MUCH GOTTEN USED TO IT, BUT I WOULD STILL PREFER IF THEY WEREN'T THERE. OVERALL, THE VALK3 IS AN EXTREMELY SOLID CUBE.
YOU1000000019_S0000032	THE PERFORMANCE IS REALLY TOP OF THE LINE AND MY PROBLEMS WITH IT ARE REALLY JUST MINOR ANNOYANCES. THE VALK HAS HUGE POTENTIAL IN MY OPINION TO BE ONE OF THE BEST
YOU1000000019_S0000033	IF NOT THE BEST SPEEDCUBES YOU CAN BUY. AND IT HONESTLY SURPRISES ME THAT I'M SAYING THAT. THIS CUBE HAS GOTTEN ME SOME NEW PERSONAL BESTS AND IT'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO BEATING MY OWLONG.
YOU1000000019_S0000034	I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE THAT I'LL MAKE IT MY MAIN, AS I STILL DO HAVE SOME MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT, BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY GIVE THIS CUBE A SHOT IF YOU'VE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000019_S0000035	AND IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, DEFINITELY GET THE PREMIUM VERSION. IT'S SET UP PERFECTLY AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. BUT ANYWAY, THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE QIYI MOFANGYI VALK3.
YOU1000000019_S0000036	IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THIS CUBE, THE LINK WILL BE IN THE DESCRIPTION DOWN BELOW. THANKS TO THE CUBICLE FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO POSSIBLE. IF YOU GUYS LIKE THIS VIDEO, GIVE IT A LIKE, AND IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO,

YOU1000000021_S0000001	THE GAME SETS UP THE WORLD AND ROLE OF MANY CHARACTERS FROM THE MAIN GAME, AND FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING SEVERAL FIGURES SUCH AS ZACK, AERITH, SEPHIROTH, AND KEY MEMBERS OF SHINRA.
YOU1000000021_S0000002	THE STORY AND GAMEPLAY ARE DONE SOLELY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ZACK, AND FEATURES FULL VOICE ACTING. FOR COMBAT, RANDOM ENCOUNTERS ARE UTILIZED WHILE ACTUAL COMBAT IS SIMILAR TO THE KINGDOM HEARTS MENU BASED REAL TIME SYSTEM.
YOU1000000021_S0000003	MECHANICS SUCH AS THE EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS SYSTEM HAVE BEEN MAJORLY OVERHAULED AND REMOVED TO REDUCE PLAYER MACRO MANAGEMENT, AND INSTEAD CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAIN BATTLE MODIFIER, THE DIGITAL MINDWAVE.
YOU1000000021_S0000004	THE DMW IS A CONTINUOUSLY SPINNING SLOT MACHINE SYSTEM THAT CONFERS VARIOUS BONUSES, EFFECTS, AND ATTACKS BASED ON THE RESULTS, INCLUDING HOW ZACK LEVELS UP.
YOU1000000021_S0000005	THE CAMPAIGN IS PROGRESSED THROUGH MISSIONS THE PLAYER CAN SELECT AT THEIR OWN PACE, OR COMPLETE SIDEQUESTS INSTEAD, TRAVELING INSTANTLY TO MANY FULLY 3D AREAS AND DUNGEONS WITH NO NEED FOR AN OVERWORLD MAP.
YOU1000000021_S0000006	THE STORY ONLY GETS LARGER FROM HERE, SO LET'S CUT IT DOWN TO SIZE WITH A RECAPITATION.
YOU1000000021_S0000007	THE GAME BEGINS WITH ZACK FAIR, SOLDIER 2ND CLASS OF THE GROUP CALLED SOLDIER, A PRIVATE MILITARY ARMY OWNED BY THE SHINRA ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY IN THE CITY OF MIDGAR.
YOU1000000021_S0000008	HE COMPLETES A TRAINING EXERCISE UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF HIS FRIEND AND COMMANDER, ANGEAL, A FIRST CLASS SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000009	ZACK HAS TREMENDOUS SKILLS AND TALENT, BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT AND RECKLESS AT TIMES, AS POINTED OUT BY HIS FELLOW SOLDIER, ANOTHER FIRST CLASS NAMED SEPHIROTH.
YOU1000000021_S0000010	ZACK IDOLIZES SEPHIROTH AS A HERO AND ASPIRES TO ONE DAY BE AT HIS LEVEL, BUT HE'S NOT READY YET, DESPITE THIS SEPHIROTH ONLY BEING PART OF THE TRAINING SIMULATION.
YOU1000000021_S0000011	AND JILL HELPS HIM OUT, REMINDING HIM TO TEMPER HIS ASPIRATIONS WITH PASSIONATE DREAMS AND STEADFAST HONOR.
YOU1000000021_S0000012	ZACK HEARS FROM A FELLOW SOLDIER OF THE MASS DESERTION OF TROOPS IN SOLDIER, AND HE'S SOON CALLED IN TO SPEAK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF SOLDIER, A MAN NAMED LANZARD.
YOU1000000021_S0000013	HE'S BRIEFED ABOUT SOLDIER FIRST CLASS GENESIS, WHO WENT MISSING DURING A MISSION IN WUTAI, AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY TO THE WEST AGAINST WHOM SHINRA COMPANY IS PERSONALLY LEVERAGING ITS MILITARY MIGHT.
YOU1000000021_S0000014	ZACK GETS TO PICK UP THE MISSION IN HIS PLACE AS A TEST FOR SOLDIER FIRST CLASS PER ANGEAL'S RECOMMENDED PROMOTION.
YOU1000000021_S0000015	ANGEAL ACCOMPANIES ZACK ON THIS MISSION AS THEY ARE TO BRING DOWN THE LAST BASTION FOR WUTAI, AND SHINRA CAN COMPLETE ITS MISSION FOR ECONOMIC WORLD DOMINATION.
YOU1000000021_S0000016	ZACK NOTES ANGEAL'S MASSIVE SWORD, THE BUSTER SWORD, IS RARELY USED, WHICH ANGEAL JOKINGLY ADMITS HE'S RATHER STINGY WITH, THOUGH DOES END UP USING IT WHEN HIS FRIEND IS IN TROUBLE.
YOU1000000021_S0000017	DURING THE MISSION, HE ENCOUNTERS IFRIT, AND WHILE HE MANAGES TO JUST HOLD HIM OFF, HE'S AMAZED TO BE RESCUED BY HIS IDOL SEPHIROTH.
YOU1000000021_S0000018	INVESTIGATING SOME FALLEN TROOPS THAT DON'T BELONG TO WUTAI, IT'S REVEALED THEY BEAR IDENTICAL FACES TO GENESIS, THE MISSING SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000019	SUDDENLY, ANGEAL GOES MISSING, AND SEPHIROTH SUSPECTS HE TOO HAS BETRAYED THEM AND DESERTED, THOUGH ZACK FERVENTLY DENIES IT.
YOU1000000021_S0000020	AFTER THE MISSION, DRACULAZARD CONFIRMS ANGEAL REALLY IS GONE FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, BUT ASSIGNS ZACK ON A NEW MISSION.
YOU1000000021_S0000021	HE'S TO INVESTIGATE WHAT HAPPENED WITH TWO MISSING AGENTS THAT WENT IN TO CHECK AROUND GENESIS' HOMETOWN.
YOU1000000021_S0000022	IN ADDITION, HE ASSIGNS SONG OF THE TURKS, SHINRA'S ELITE OPERATIVE AND ESPIONAGE UNIT, TO COOPERATE ON THIS MISSION.
YOU1000000021_S0000023	HEADING TO BANORA VILLAGE, WHICH WAS ALSO IN JILL'S HOMETOWN, ZACK FINDS AND FEEDS A FEW MORE GENESIS CLONES.
YOU1000000021_S0000024	SUNG EXPLAINS THIS TECHNOLOGY WAS STOLEN FROM SHINRA, WHICH ALLOWED GENESIS TO IMPLANT HIS ABILITIES AND STRENGTH ON OTHER SOLDIER MEMBERS OR MONSTERS.
YOU1000000021_S0000025	ORIGINALLY, IT WAS TO CLONE THEIR BEST SOLDIERS TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOW NUMBERS THEY CURRENTLY HAVE, BUT ZACK IS MORE KEEN TO NOTE THAT THIS INFERS THAT SOLDIERS AND MONSTERS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY THE SAME.
YOU1000000021_S0000026	MOVING ON, SONG INFORMS ZACK THAT ANGEAL AND GENESIS WERE CHILDHOOD BEST FRIENDS THAT GREW UP TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY SEPHIROTH THINKS THEY ARE IN CAHOOTS WITH THEIR DESERTION.
YOU1000000021_S0000027	FINDING ANGEAL'S MOTHER, JILLIAN, SHE NOTES ZACK IS THE RESTLESS PUPPY ANGEAL OFTEN SPOKE ABOUT, AND SHE TELLS HIM GENESIS CAME BY A MONTH AGO WITH AN ARMY OF MINIONS, AND PROCEEDED TO START KILLING TOWNSFOLK.
YOU1000000021_S0000028	SHE ALSO LETS ZACK KNOW ANGEAL DID COME BY HERE AND LEFT HIS PRIZE SWORD BEHIND, WHICH SHE EXPLAINS REPRESENTS HIS FAMILY'S HONOR.
YOU1000000021_S0000029	IT TURNS OUT GENESIS KILLED HIS PARENTS, AND ZACK MAKES A PLEA TO BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO TALK WITH ANGEAL, AND SEE ABOUT CONVINCING HIM AND GENESIS TO COME BACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000030	SANG SEES NOW ZACK'S PASSION AS WHY SEPHIROTH, WHO WAS ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED THIS MISSION BUT REFUSED, CHOSE ZACK TO TAKE HIS PLACE.
YOU1000000021_S0000031	HE WAS ACTUALLY COUNTING ON ZACK TO BRING BACK ANGEAL AND GENESIS, HIS ONLY FRIENDS IN THIS WORLD. THEY DISCOVER GENESIS, BUT HE BEATS THEM BACK, AND ANGEAL RESURFACES.
YOU1000000021_S0000032	ZACK DISCOVERS ANGEAL STANDING OVER A DEAD JULIAN AND IS SIMPLY CONFUSED BY THE ENTIRE SITUATION.
YOU1000000021_S0000033	SUMMONING BAHAMUT TO DISTRACT AND SETTLE DOWN A FRUSTRATED ZACK, BOTH GENESIS AND ANGEAL CHOOSE TO TURN THEIR BACK ON SHINRA, WHILE ASKING HOW LONG ZACK HIMSELF CAN STAND LIVING ON THAT SIDE.
YOU1000000021_S0000034	AFTERWARDS, GENESIS REVEALS THEY ARE ALL MONSTERS, QUITE LITERALLY, AS HE UNVEILS A SINGLE LARGE BLACK WING. PROCLAIMING THIS MEANS THEY HAVE NO HONOR DREAMS ANYMORE, HE FLIES OFF.
YOU1000000021_S0000035	REFUSING TO BELIEVE THAT SOLDIER MEANS MONSTER, ZACK IS INTERRUPTED AS GENERAL LAUNCHES AN AIR STRIKE TO WIPE THE TOWN OF BANORA OFF THE MAP, ENSURING NO WITNESSES TO THIS EVENT.
YOU1000000021_S0000036	SOON AFTER, SHINRA WINS THE WAR WITH WUTAI AND HAS EVERY CITY IN THE WORLD UNDER ITS THUMB NOW.
YOU1000000021_S0000037	TIME PASSES, AND ZACK IS GREETED BY SEPHIROTH PERSONALLY AS HE IS PROMOTED TO SOLDIER FIRST CLASS OFFICIALLY, THOUGH ATTAINING THIS DREAM OF HIS SEEMS BITTERSWEET.
YOU1000000021_S0000038	HOWEVER, DUTY CALLS AND HE'S ASSIGNED A NEW MISSION. AFTER SUITING UP IN HIS NEW BLACK UNIFORM, HE'S TOLD A KILL COMMAND HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR AANGIL, GENESIS, AND THEIR CLONE ARMY.
YOU1000000021_S0000039	UNFORTUNATELY, ZACK CANNOT BE TRUSTED DUE TO HIS RELATIONSHIP TO ANGEAL, AND EVEN SEPHIROTH HOLDS HIS OWN THOUGHTS ON THE ISSUE.
YOU1000000021_S0000040	SUDDENLY, THEY'RE INTERRUPTED AS THE BUILDING IS UNDER ATTACK, AND ZACK WORKS ALONGSIDE TURKS, RENO, RUDE, AND SISNE AS THEY TAKE OUT MORE GENESIS CLONES.
YOU1000000021_S0000041	CYSTEINE ENCOUNTERS GENESIS HIMSELF BUT IS SOON OVERWHELMED, AND ZACK RESCUES HER AND WEATHERS HIS PUNISHING ASSAULT IN A ONE ON ONE DUEL.
YOU1000000021_S0000042	AS HE STRIKES DOWN GENESIS, HE GETS A CALL FROM SEPHIROTH WHO'S LOCATED ANGEAL.
YOU1000000021_S0000043	HE TELLS ZACK TO HURRY OVER BEFORE THE SHINRA ARMY ARRIVES SO THEY CAN HELP THEIR MUTUAL FRIEND ESCAPE, AND ZACK IS HAPPY TO HELP.
YOU1000000021_S0000044	HOWEVER, WHEN HE ARRIVES AND DESTROYS A NEW MONSTER, HE'S SHOCKED TO SEE A BEAR'S AND JILL'S FACE ON IT.
YOU1000000021_S0000045	AS SEPHIROTH TALKS MORE WITH ZACK, HE ELABORATES MORE HOW ANGEAL, GENESIS, AND HIMSELF WERE CLOSE FRIENDS, AND EVEN THOUGH SEPHIROTH HIMSELF WAS THE COMPANY'S PRIZED WAR HERO, GENESIS HIMSELF WANTED SUCH PRESTIGE AS WELL.
YOU1000000021_S0000046	EVEN WHEN THEY WOULD TRAIN IN THE COMPANY'S TRAINING ROOM, SEPHIROTH COULD HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST BOTH ANGEAL AND GENESIS. THOUGH, WHEN GENESIS GOT SERIOUS, NOT EVEN HIS FRIEND ANGEAL COULD CALM HIM DOWN.
YOU1000000021_S0000047	EVEN THEN, SEPHIROTH WAS THE BETTER FIGHTER, ONCE INJURING GENESIS'S PRIME EVEN MORE THAN HIS BLADE.
YOU1000000021_S0000048	SURVEYING THE MONSTER, SEPHIROTH DEDUCES THE DUO ARE IN LEAGUE WITH DR. HOLLANDER, WHICH TIES INTO THE STORY HE JUST TOLD.
YOU1000000021_S0000049	AT ONE TIME, THE SMALL WOUND SEPHIROTH DEALT WASN'T HEALING FOR SOME REASON, AND THE DOCTOR TREATING HIM WAS DR. HOLLANDER.
YOU1000000021_S0000050	HE EXPLAINS THAT SOME MAKO ENERGY INFECTED THE ROOM WHEN IT WAS DEALT, AND ANGEAL WOULD HAVE TO BE THE DONOR IN A TRANSFUSION.
YOU1000000021_S0000051	SEPHIROTH IMMEDIATELY QUESTIONS WHY HE WAS IMMEDIATELY REJECTED AS A DONOR, BUT GOT NO ANSWER.
YOU1000000021_S0000052	RATHER, HE LEARNED THAT HOLLANDER WAS CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT ON A SOLDIER TYPE G, IN WHICH MONSTERS WERE TO BE MADE, BUT ONE FAILED EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY PRODUCED GENESIS AS A RESULT.
YOU1000000021_S0000053	HOWEVER, SUCH AN EXISTENCE HAS PROVED TO HAVE SIDE EFFECTS, SUCH AS HIS BODY RAPIDLY DEGRADING, AND THE CURIOUS ABILITY TO MAKE COPIES OF HIMSELF.
YOU1000000021_S0000054	HOLLANDER HIMSELF APPEARS, SURPRISED TO SEE THEM, BUT EXPLAINS ONLY HE CAN STOP GENESIS' DEGRADATION. AFTER WHICH GENESIS HIMSELF APPEARS, AND EXPLAINS HOLLANDER WON'T BE CAPTURED.
YOU1000000021_S0000055	GENESIS LIKENS THEIR SITUATION TO HIS FAVORITE PLAY, LOVELESS, AND WONDERS WHICH OF THE THREE FRIENDS WOULD BE THE HERO, TO WHICH HE STILL ENVIES SEPHIROTH.
YOU1000000021_S0000056	MEANWHILE, ZACK PURSUES HOLLANDER, BUT ANGEAL HIMSELF INTERJECTS, AND SHOWS HIM HE TOO HAS BECOME A MONSTER WITH HIS OWN SET OF WINGS.
YOU1000000021_S0000057	ZACK REFUSES TO FIGHT AGAINST ANGEAL, WHO IS FRUSTRATED AS HIS REALITY OF BEING A MONSTER IS CLASHING WITH HIS PRINCIPLES AND DREAMS, AND ZACK IS SENT TUMBLING DOWN.
YOU1000000021_S0000058	WHEN HE COMES TO, ZACK IS IN A CHURCH IN THE SLUMS, WHERE HE'S AWOKEN UP BY AERITH, A YOUNG WOMAN LIVING THERE. HE'S IMMEDIATELY SMITTEN WITH AERITH, ASKING HER OUT ON A DATE BUT GETTING QUICKLY TURNED DOWN.
YOU1000000021_S0000059	HE'S IMPRESSED BY THE RARE SIGHT OF FLOWERS IN MIDGAR, SUGGESTING SHE SELL THEM AND NOT ONLY LIVEN UP MIDGAR WITH FLOWERS, BUT ALSO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON THE SIDE.
YOU1000000021_S0000060	SHE STILL ENDS UP SPENDING THE DAY WITH ZACK, AS AT HER FAVORITE SHOP, ZACK INSISTS ON GETTING HER HER CHOICE OF A GIFT, RESULTING IN AERITH PICKING OUT A LARGE PINK HAIR RIBBON.
YOU1000000021_S0000061	SHE LOVES THE GIFT, PROMISING TO WEAR IT ALWAYS, THOUGH AS THEIR NOT OFFICIALLY A DATE DATE CONTINUES, SHE QUESTIONS THE NORMALCY OF MEMBERS OF SOLDIERS. AS RUMOR GOES, THEY RECEIVE SOME SORT OF SPECIAL SURGERY THAT TURNS THEM BEYOND HUMAN.
YOU1000000021_S0000062	SHE ADMITS THEIR LUST FOR BATTLE ALSO MAKES THEM A BIT FRIGHTENING, AND ZACK CHOOSES THIS TIME TO CONFESS HE'S WITH SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000063	SHE'S NATURALLY SURPRISED, AND ACTUALLY LIKES HIS UNIQUE EYES, TO WHICH ZACK CONTINUES TO FLIRT, SHOWING OFF THE TRADEMARK MAKO INFUSED EYES OF A SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000064	ZACK GETS CALLED BACK TO SHINRA, BUT SUCCEEDED IN LEAVING A GOOD IMPRESSION ON AERITH, AND THEY AGREE TO SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN. EN ROUTE BACK TO SHINRA, ANGEAL STOPS ZACK AGAIN, THIS TIME MORE WILLING TO TALK.
YOU1000000021_S0000065	HE ASKS FOR ZACK'S HELP AS HE'S SLOWLY LOSING HIS MIND, AND NOT ONLY WANTS TO KEEP HIS HONOR, BUT ALSO WANTS ZACK TO HELP HIM DEFEAT THEIR ENEMIES THAT ARE CAUSING SO MUCH SUFFERING.
YOU1000000021_S0000066	ZACK AGREES, BUT IS SWEPT AWAY BEFORE HE CAN ASK FURTHER QUESTIONS. HE'S DELIVERED TO SEPHIROTH, WHO'S ALSO HELPING ANGEAL, AS THEY FIGHT GENESIS, WHOM THEY SUSPECT IS BEING USED BY HALLENDER TO KILL ANOTHER NOTORIOUS SCIENTIST WITHIN SHINRA, HOJO.
YOU1000000021_S0000067	MEANWHILE, HOJO SEES THROUGH THE POWER PLAY WHEN GENESIS ARRIVES, THOUGH ZACK AND ANGEAL ARE SOON TO ARRIVE AS WELL. GENESIS RETREATS, BUT NOT BEFORE SUMMONING BAHAMUT FURY FOR ZACK TO DEAL WITH.
YOU1000000021_S0000069	LATER, ZACK GOES TO VISIT AERITH WHEN TSENG HALTS HIM TO CALL HIM INTO A MISSION TO MORDEOHEIM, AND GIVES ZACK PAUSE WHEN HE SAYS HE ALSO KNOWS AERITH, BUT WON'T ELABORATE.
YOU1000000021_S0000070	GENESIS FORCES SHOOT DOWN THEIR HELICOPTER, THOUGH ZACK, SONG, AND A COUPLE OF COMMON SHINRA INFANTRYMEN MANAGE TO SURVIVE.
YOU1000000021_S0000071	THEY JOKE THAT ZACK IS A COUNTRY BOY FROM THE STICKS, SO THIS HARSH TERRAIN WON'T BOTHER HIM, THOUGH IT TURNS OUT ONE OF THE GRUNTS IS AS WELL.
YOU1000000021_S0000072	ZACK IS FROM THE TINY VILLAGE OF GONGAGA, AND THIS VILLAGE IS FROM NIBELHEIM, WHO INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS CLOUD.
YOU1000000021_S0000073	AS THE MISSION FOR HOLLANDER CONTINUES, GENESIS MOVES TO KILL HIM, AS HE'S ALREADY BEGUN VISIBLY DEGRADING, AND CLAIMS HE DOESN'T NEED HOLLANDER ANYMORE.
YOU1000000021_S0000074	ZACK SAVES HOLLANDER, WHO BEATS AWAY CLOUD WHILE TRYING TO RESTRAIN HIM, AND ZACK DUELS ONCE MORE WITH GENESIS, PROVING HE'S A MATCH AGAINST THE DEGRADING ACE, WHO IS SEVERELY WEAKENED AND PROMISES TO END THE WORLD WITH HIS OWN MISERABLE FATE.
YOU1000000021_S0000076	ON HIS WAY OUT, HE IS MET BY ANGEAL AS WELL AS HOLLANDER, WHO EXPLAINS THE G IN PROJECT G WAS NOT FOR GENESIS, BUT FOR JILLIAN, WHO WAS ANGEAL'S MOTHER, WHO APPARENTLY TOOK HER OWN LIFE EARLIER IN VENORA.
YOU1000000021_S0000077	THE EXPERIMENT WAS TWOFOLD, JILLIAN HAD JENOVA CELLS INJECTED INTO HER WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANGEAL, AND GENESIS SIMPLY HAD JENOVA CELLS IMPLANTED DIRECTLY INTO HIM AS A TEST TUBE BABY.
YOU1000000021_S0000078	WHAT THIS RESULTED IN WAS THE FAILURE GENESIS, GROWING UP STRONG BUT DOOMED TO A SHORT LIFESPAN, WHILE ANGEAL WAS PERCEIVED AND BORN AS A PERFECT SPECIMEN.
YOU1000000021_S0000079	REASON BEING, ANGEAL CAN USE THE JENOVA CELLS AS A TWO WAY CONDUIT AS INTENDED. ANGEAL THEN EXPLAINS HIS CELLS CAN ABSORB GENETIC TRAITS AND PASS IT TO OTHERS, BEYOND WHAT GENESIS CAN MANAGE, WHICH IS ONLY IMPRINT THEM ONTO OTHERS.
YOU1000000021_S0000080	CHOOSING TO END HIS SUFFERING BY HIS OWN HANDS, ANGEAL CASTS AWAY HOLLANDER, AND ABSORBS A VARIETY OF MONSTERS HE CREATED TO HELP TEST AND STRENGTHEN ZACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000081	THE RESULTING ABOMINATION SLASHES ZACK CLEANLY ON THE CHEEK, AND HE IS FORCED TO KILL THE RESULTING MESS THAT USED TO BE HIS FRIEND AND MENTOR.
YOU1000000021_S0000082	AFTER WINNING A BITTER VICTORY, A DEGRADING ANGEAL IS GRATEFUL THAT ZACK ENDED HIM WITH DIGNITY AND HONOR. BEFORE DYING, HE PASSES ON HIS FAMILY SWORD AND LEGACY OF HONOR, THE BUSTER SWORD, TO ZACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000084	EVEN AFTER RETURNING TO MIDGAR, ZACK OPENLY MOURNS THE ERYTH, WITH WHOM HE'S DEVELOPED A MUCH CLOSER RELATIONSHIP, AND HAS CHOSEN TO RETAIN THE SCAR ANGEAL GAVE HIM AS A MEMENTO.
YOU1000000021_S0000085	TIME PASSES AS ZAKEDA'S HAIRSTYLE HAS MATURED.
YOU1000000021_S0000086	HE IS NO LONGER THE YOUNG PUPPY HE USED TO BE, AND IS NOW A MENTOR HIMSELF TO A NEW CLASS OF SOLDIER ROOKIES.
YOU1000000021_S0000087	SHINRA SENDS HIM FOR SOME R&R AT COSTA DEL SOL, WITH CISNE WATCHING OVER HIM, AS IT TURNS OUT DIRECTOR LAZARD HAS SINCE GONE MISSING, AND WAS SECRETLY USING COMPANY MONEY TO FUEL HOLLANDER'S RESEARCH.
YOU1000000021_S0000088	SHE TEASES HIM ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND ERETH, AND EXPLAINS SHE'S UNDER CONSTANT TURK SURVEILLANCE AS IT TURNS OUT SHE IS THE LAST LIVING MEMBER OF A RACE CALLED THE ANCIENT.
YOU1000000021_S0000089	ZACK IS SURPRISED NOT ONLY TO LEARN THIS, BUT ALSO THAT AERITH NEVER TOLD HIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000090	UNEXPECTEDLY, GENESIS COPIES ATTACK FROM THE SEA, WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN GENESIS IS STILL AROUND TOO.
YOU1000000021_S0000091	SONG ISN'T SO SURE, AND CONJECTURES THAT SINCE ALL SOULS RETURNED TO THE LIFESTREAM, IT'S POSSIBLE GENESIS'S SOUL IS STILL ABLE TO CONTROL HIS COPIES FROM THERE AS WELL.
YOU1000000021_S0000092	AND SO, ZACK'S VACATION IS OVER AS THE THREE OF THEM ARE TO INVESTIGATE AN ATTACK ON JUNON.
YOU1000000021_S0000093	IT TURNS OUT MORE GENESIS CLONES WERE ATTACKING, AND THIS TIME, HOLLANDER WAS EVEN THERE, THOUGH HE GETS AWAY ONCE AGAIN.
YOU1000000021_S0000094	SEPHIROTH COMES BY TO GREET ZACK AND QUESTIONS IF GENESIS REALLY DID DIE. HE DELIBERATELY DROPS THAT EVEN THE SLUMS IN MIDGAR ARE BEING ATTACKED, ENCOURAGES ZACK TO RETURN THERE, AND PROMISES THEY'LL MEET AGAIN.
YOU1000000021_S0000095	RETURNING TO AERITH, HE FINDS A MONSTER DOG THERE, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS, THOUGH ZACK NOTES IT'S ALSO AN ANGELIC COPY, AND IS KEEN TO PROTECT AERITH.
YOU1000000021_S0000096	HOWEVER, ITS WEAK DUE TO DEGRADATION AND CHOOSES TO REST IN THE RAFTERS. MEANWHILE, ZACK BAILS AERITH A CARD TO SELL FLOWERS FROM, AND HAS HER GIVE HIM A LIST OF HER WISHES SO HE CAN DO HIS BEST TO MAKE HER HAPPY.
YOU1000000021_S0000097	UNFORTUNATELY, AN URGENT MISSION COMES UP TO SEPARATE THEIR TIME TOGETHER.
YOU1000000021_S0000099	NOW, SEPHIROTH AND ZACK HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO COME IN AFTER A MONSTER OUTBREAK NEAR A RURAL MAKO REACTOR, THAT HAS EVEN KILLED A SOLDIER OPERATIVE THERE.
YOU1000000021_S0000100	INTERESTINGLY, THESE OPERATIVES WERE TRACKING THE MISSING LAZARD, AND REPORTED A STRANGE POD DEVICE SIMILAR TO HOLLANDER'S, WHICH MEANS LAZARD, HOLLANDER, AND GENESIS MIGHT ALL BE INVOLVED HERE.
YOU1000000021_S0000101	AS THEIR MISSION IN MENTIONS NOTHING OF THEIR OLD FRIENDS, SEPHIROTH PRIVATELY CONFESSES TO ZACK THAT HE'S SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING LEAVING SHINRA AS WELL, DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MISSION.
YOU1000000021_S0000102	BEFORE DEPARTING, ZACK SPENDS SOME PRECIOUS TIME WITH AERITH, THOUGH SONG IS NEVER FAR OFF.
YOU1000000021_S0000103	SONG PROMISES TO PROTECT AARON AS HE'S ALWAYS DONE, AND ZACK SINCERELY THINKS OF HIM AS THE ONLY PERSON HE CAN RELY ON THESE DAYS.
YOU1000000021_S0000104	BEFORE THE MISSION, CLOUD TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE THREE DISPATCHED TO HIM, AND TURNS OUT THE REACTOR THEY MUST INVESTIGATE IS IN CLOUD'S HOMETOWN OF NIBELHEIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000105	AS THEY ARRIVE, SEPHIROTH MAKES SMALL TALK, ASKING CLOUD HOW IT FEELS TO BE HOME AGAIN, AND TRYING TO RELATE AS HE HAS NO ORIGINAL TOWN, AND ALL HE KNOWS IS HIS MOTHER'S NAME TO BE JENOVA, WHO DIED AFTER HE WAS BORN.
YOU1000000021_S0000106	IN TOWN, THEY ARE MET BY A LOCAL TOWN GIRL BY THE NAME OF TIFA.
YOU1000000021_S0000107	WHEN TIFA LEARNS HE'S A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS, SHE SEEMS SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ONLY SENT HIM AND SEPHIROTH, AND BEGINS TO ASK SOMETHING ELSE, BUT STOPS AND RUNS OFF INSTEAD.
YOU1000000021_S0000108	AS SEPHIROTH MOVES ON TO INVESTIGATE, HE TELLS CLOUD HE CAN VISIT HIS FAMILY WHILE HE'S IN TOWN, AND WHEN ZACK WONDERS WHY CLOUD IS HESITATING IN WEARING HIS HELMET AND MASK, HE ADMITS ITS SOMETHING EMBARRASSINGLY PERSONAL.
YOU1000000021_S0000109	HE LATER ADMITS HE WAS EXAGGERATING AND TELLING HIS FRIENDS BACK HOME THAT HE WAS ALREADY A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS, AND IS TOO ASHAMED TO CONFRONT THAT LIE NOW.
YOU1000000021_S0000110	MEANWHILE, SEPHIROTH FINDS THIS WHOLE AREA ODDLY FAMILIAR, AND AFTER THEY LEARN T FIST TO BE THEIR GUIDE TO THE REACTOR, THEY PAUSE TO HAVE A GROUP PHOTO TAKEN.
YOU1000000021_S0000111	AS ZACK, SEPHIROTH, TIFA, AND A HIDING CLOUD ARRIVE AT THE REACTOR, CLOUD IS TOLD TO WAIT OUTSIDE WITH TIFA AND KEEP HER SAFE.
YOU1000000021_S0000112	WITHIN, ZACK FINDS IT INTERESTING THAT THE CHAMBER TO THE REACTOR IS ALSO NAMED THE SAME AS SEPHIROTH'S MOTHER, AS THE WAR HERO SEPHIROTH IDENTIFIES THE CAUSE OF THE REACTOR MALFUNCTION.
YOU1000000021_S0000113	ZACK PEERS INTO ONE OF THE PODS POWERING THE PLANT AND IS SHOCKED TO FIND A MONSTER WITHIN.
YOU1000000021_S0000114	SEPHIROTH EXPLAINS THAT WHILE THE AVERAGE SOLDIER IS A MAKO INFUSED HUMAN, THEY ARE STILL SIMPLY STRONGER THAN NORMAL HUMANS.
YOU1000000021_S0000115	HOWEVER, THIS THING HAS MAKO LEVELS EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER THAN EVEN A SOLDIER. SEPHIROTH DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE, BEYOND THAT THEY ARE ABOMINATIONS CREATED BY DR. HOJO IN HIS LAB.
YOU1000000021_S0000116	ZACH NOTES SEPHIROTH IS WELL ABOVE AVERAGE HIMSELF, AND ASKS IF THERE IS SOMETHING MORE TO THAT, AND IT TRIGGERS A SPLITTING HEADACHE FOR SEPHIROTH.
YOU1000000021_S0000117	SEPHIROTH COMES TO A HORRIFYING HYPOTHESIS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE HE WAS CREATED THE SAME WAY, AND IT BECOMES A CRISIS OF IDENTITY IRONICALLY IDENTICAL TO HIS FRIENDS GENESIS AND ANGEAL.
YOU1000000021_S0000118	HE ADMITS HE ALWAYS KNEW HE WAS UNLIKE OTHER CHILDREN GROWING UP, BUT COULD NEVER PLACE WHY, AND DOESN'T WANT TO THINK THE REASON COULD BE THAT HE'S BEEN THE SAME AS A MONSTER.
YOU1000000021_S0000119	HE QUESTIONS HIS HUMANITY WHEN SUDDENLY A SNEAK ATTACK BY GENESIS KNOCKS ZACK BACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000120	GENESIS SWOOPS IN TO INFORM SEPHIROTH THAT OF THE 3 FRIENDS, HE WAS THE GREATEST MONSTER TO COME OUT OF THE JENOVA PROJECT, POSSIBLY DUE TO HAVING HOJO INSTEAD OF HOLLANDER MANAGING HIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000121	ZACK IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE CONFIRMED EXISTENCE OF GENESIS, BUT HE'S IGNORED AS GENESIS CONTINUES TO PUSH SEPHIROTH WITH HIS PAST.
YOU1000000021_S0000122	HE EXPLAINS THE JENOVA PROJECTS WERE ALL PROJECTS INVOLVING USAGE OF JENOVA'S CELLS. JENOVA HERSELF WAS EXCAVATED FROM A 2000 YEAR OLD ROCK LAYER, AND IS A TRUE MONSTER HERSELF.
YOU1000000021_S0000123	SANDBROTH IS SHOCKED AGAIN, YET GENESIS CONTINUES, EXPOSING THAT JENOVA PROJECT G CREATED SUCCESSES LIKE ANGEO AND FAILURES LIKE HIMSELF,
YOU1000000021_S0000124	AND JENOVA PROJECT S USED THE REMAINS OF EVERY EXPERIMENT THUS FAR TO CREATE A PERFECT MONSTER, SEPHIROTH HIMSELF.
YOU1000000021_S0000125	IN ADDITION, SEPHIROTH CANNOT COPY OR DIFFUSE HIS GENES, SO HE CANNOT DEGRADE.
YOU1000000021_S0000126	HE MAKES ANOTHER PLEA FOR SEPHIROTH TO SHARE CELLS WITH HIM, AND SEPHIROTH REPLIES THAT REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING HE JUST SAID BEING TRUE OR NOT, HE'LL DO THE RIGHT THING AND LET THE EVIL GENESIS ROT.
YOU1000000021_S0000127	HOWEVER, ZACK MOVES AFTER GENESIS BUT HALTS TO SAVE TIFA AND A BEATEN CLOUD FROM A MONSTER
YOU1000000021_S0000128	AFTERWARDS, CLOUD WISHES HE WERE STRONG LIKE ZACK, BUT ZACK WARNS HIM NOT TO GET TANGLED UP WITH SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000129	THE NEXT MORNING, TIFA INFORMS ZACK THAT SEPHIROTH IS IN THE SHINRA MANSION, AND ZACK GETS A PHONE CALL FROM AERITH, ENDING IT WITH A PROMISE TO SEE HER AFTER HER MISSION.
YOU1000000021_S0000130	MEANWHILE, SEPHIROTH HAS FOUND AN OLD ARCHIVE UNDERNEATH THE MANSION, AND WITHIN READS MANY REPORTS ON THE JENOVA PROJECT, LEARNING INFORMATION SUCH AS JENOVA WAS ALSO AN ANCIENT LIKE AERITH.
YOU1000000021_S0000131	AFTER WAITING 7 DAYS WHILE SEPHIROTH READS NON STOP, ZACK COMES OUT TO DISCOVER NIBELHEIM
YOU1000000021_S0000132	IS SUDDENLY ON FIRE WITH MANY TOWNSFOLK SLAIN. EVEN CLOUD IS BEATEN ONCE AGAIN, AND AROUND THE CORNER IS SEPHIROTH HIMSELF, CALMLY STANDING AMIDST THE FLAMES.
YOU1000000021_S0000133	FOLLOWING HIM BACK TO THE REACTOR, ZACK SEES AN INJURED TIFA WITHIN, HATEFULLY CURSING BOTH SHINRA AND SOLDIER.
YOU1000000021_S0000134	BREAKING THROUGH THE DOOR TO JENOVA, ZACK SEES SEPHIROTH BEYOND UNUSUALLY UNSETTLED AND TALKING STRANGELY, ABOUT GOING TO THE PROMISED LAND TOGETHER WITH HIS MOTHER.
YOU1000000021_S0000135	CONFRONTING SEPHIROTH, ZACK IS IGNORED AS SEPHIROTH INSISTS HIS MOTHER, THE ANCIENT, WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE RULED THE PLANET.
YOU1000000021_S0000136	SOMEHOW, HUMANS STOLE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR SOVEREIGNTY AND HUNTED THE ANCIENTS TO NEAR EXTINCTION INSTEAD.
YOU1000000021_S0000137	FINALLY FED UP WITH THE CRIMES OF HUMANS, AND SHINRA IN PARTICULAR, SEPHIROTH SEES WHAT ANGEAL AND GENESIS KEPT WARNING ABOUT, AND CHOOSES TO STAND ALONE.
YOU1000000021_S0000138	EMBRACING THE FACT THAT HE WAS NEVER HUMAN AND THUS DOESN'T HAVE TO PRETEND TO BE ANYMORE, DISGUSTED WITH SHINRA'S SICK AND TWISTED PAST OF VIOLATING HIS MOTHER,
YOU1000000021_S0000139	AND ACCEPTING OF BEING OF THE MASTER RACE OF ANCIENTS, SEPHIROTH SEVERS ALL TIES TO SHINRA, SOLDIER, AND THE HUMAN RACE.
YOU1000000021_S0000140	HE TEARS AWAY A MECHANICAL FACADE TO REVEAL A REAL GENOA, WHO HAS BEEN SAVAGELY MUTILATED AND EXPERIMENTED ON BY SHINRA, AND LEFT TO BE A MONSTROUS BATTERY WITHIN THIS POWER PLANT.
YOU1000000021_S0000141	ZAK STILL WANTS ANSWERS FOR THE DEAD TOWNSFOLK AND QUESTIONS SEPHIROTH'S SANITY, BUT SEPHIROTH HAS NO MORE WORDS FOR ANY HUMAN, EVEN IF THEY USED TO BE HIS ALLIES.
YOU1000000021_S0000142	FEELING BETRAYED, ZACK ATTACKS SEPHIROTH WHO PARRIES HIM EASILY, AND KNOCKS HIM TO THE DEPTHS OF THE REACTOR.
YOU1000000021_S0000143	AS THEY CLASH, ZACK REMEMBERS WHEN SEPHIROTH WAS STILL THE IDEAL HERO AND ROLE MODEL TO HIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000144	ONCE EXPLAINING THAT MATERIA, WHICH ALLOWS HUMANS TO USE MAGIC, IS FORMED FROM CONDENSED MAKO ENERGY FROM THE PLANET, AND CONTAINS KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCIENTS, WHO ARE BOUND TO THE PLANET AND HAVE THE POWER TO CONTROL IT AT WILL.
YOU1000000021_S0000145	ACCUSING SEPHIROTH OF LOSING HIS WAY, HE IS COUNTERED BY SEPHIROTH WHO CONSIDERS HIMSELF TO BE THE CHOSEN ONE, DESPITE BEING ENGINEERED BY HUMANS TO BE A PARAGON ANCIENT TO DO THEIR BIDDING.
YOU1000000021_S0000146	HE INTENDS TO CARRY ON WHAT HE FEELS IS THE RIGHT OF THE ANCIENTS AND RULE THIS WORLD, AND TAKE IT BACK FROM POWER HUNGRY HUMANS LIKE THE SHINRA CORPORATION.
YOU1000000021_S0000147	AGAIN, THEY CLASH, WITH SEPHIROTH CLEARLY CONTROLLING THE DUEL. FORCED BACK, THE BUSTER SWORD IS KNOCKED FROM ZACK'S HAND AS ZACK NO LONGER HAS THE ENERGY TO FIGHT BACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000148	AFTER THE EXHAUSTIVE FIGHT, SEPHIROTH IS FIXATED ON LIBERATING HIS MOTHER, AND DOESN'T NOTICE CLOUD COMING UP BEHIND HIM WITH ZACK'S SWORD AND STRIKING HIM WITH A SNEAK ATTACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000149	CLOUD THEN RUSHES THE TEAM ASIDE, BUT SEPHIROTH COMES OUT BEARING THE HEAD OF JENOVA AND UPSET AT CLOUD'S INSULTING STRIKE.
YOU1000000021_S0000150	ZACK URGES CLOUD TO FINISH OFF AN INJURED SEPHIROTH, BUT NATURALLY, CLOUD IS NOWHERE NEAR SEPHIROTH'S LEAGUE IN TERMS OF STRENGTH.
YOU1000000021_S0000151	HOWEVER, CLOUD MAKES UP FOR IT IN SHEER GUTS, AS AFTER SEPHIROTH IMPALES HIM ON HIS SWORD AND ISSUES A WARNING NOT TO MAKE HIM MAD, CLOUD INSTEAD USES ALL HIS STRENGTH TO LIFT UP SEPHIROTH, WHO'S SURPRISED BY THE FEAT, AND HURL HIM AWAY.
YOU1000000021_S0000152	CLOUD SUCCUMBS TO HIS INJURIES NEXT TO ZACK, AND AS THEY BOTH PASS OUT, DR. HOJO ARRIVES ON THE SCENE AND CHOOSES CLOUD TO BE HIS NEXT TEST SUBJECT.
YOU1000000021_S0000154	THE NEXT THING HE KNOWS, A VISION OF ANGEAL WAKES ZACK UP AS HE BREAKS OUT OF HIS TANK. FIGHTING DISORIENTATION, HE GETS CLOUD OUT, BUT CLOUD IS STUCK IN A COMATOSE STATE.
YOU1000000021_S0000155	AFTER CHANGING CLOUD INTO A SPARE SOLDIER FIRST CLASS UNIFORM, ZACK RECALLS AERITH'S LAST LETTER FOR HIM, IN WHICH SHE WANTS TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER, WHICH PROMPTS HIM TO MAKE HIS NEXT DESTINATION, BACK TO MIDGAR.
YOU1000000021_S0000156	HOWEVER, SCHINNER LABELS THEM BOTH FUGITIVE SAMPLES, SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES NOW RUNNING FROM THE ARMY, AND CISSNE ACTUALLY MANAGES TO CATCH UP TO THEM FIRST.
YOU1000000021_S0000157	HE PLEADS WITH HER TO JUST WALK AWAY AS HE KNOWS ITS A TALL ORDER TO ESCAPE THE TURKS, BUT CISSNE CHOOSES HER DUTY OVER PERSONAL FEELINGS.
YOU1000000021_S0000158	HOWEVER, ZACK REFUSES TO FIGHT HER SERIOUSLY FOR NOW, AND MUST LEAVE HER BEHIND.
YOU1000000021_S0000159	STILL, SHE FOLLOWS THEM AND EMPATHIZES WITH CLOUD'S SEVERE CASE OF MAKO ADDICTION, AND SO HELPS THEM THIS ONCE TO ESCAPE WITH HER MOTORCYCLE.
YOU1000000021_S0000160	HOWEVER, GENESIS ISN'T DONE, AS HE INTERRUPTS THEIR RIDE, SEIZING ZACK AND PULLING OUT A BIT OF HIS HAIR.
YOU1000000021_S0000161	HE KNOWS THEY ARE HOJO'S LATEST EXPERIMENTS, AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF JENOVA'S POWER RUNS THROUGH BOTH OF THEM.
YOU1000000021_S0000162	HE HAS ONE OF HIS CLONES EAT HIS HAIR SAMPLE IN ORDER TO GAIN THE CELLS NEEDED TO CEASE HIS DEGRADATION, BUT ALL IT DOES IS MUTATE THE CLONE INTO A GRUESOME MONSTER.
YOU1000000021_S0000163	LATER, ZACK CROSSES BY HIS HOMETOWN OF GONGAGA, BUT SISNEI IS THERE AND WARNS HIM THE TURKS ALREADY EXPECTED HIM TO VISIT HIS PARENTS, THOUGH THEY ARE ALSO HUNTING FOR ANGEAL IN THE AREA, WHO REPORTEDLY WAS SIGHTED IN SHINRA'S LAB.
YOU1000000021_S0000164	SHE'S WATCHING OVER HIS FAMILY FOR HIM, AND TEASES THAT HIS PARENTS HAVE ALREADY ASKED HER TO JOIN THE FAMILY.
YOU1000000021_S0000165	ZACK NOTES SOMETHING LIKE ANGEAL IS ALSO NEARBY, BUT FLIES AWAY AGAIN, AND LATER HE IS SURPRISED TO FIND DR. HOLLANDER AND GENESIS HIMSELF.
YOU1000000021_S0000166	IT TURNS OUT THAT AFTER THE DOCTOR NEARLY DIED BY THE HAND OF GENESIS, HE USED HIS CELLS TO STAY ALIVE AND DESPITE DEGRADING ON BORROWED TIME, IS LOOKING FOR A CURE FOR THAT NOW.
YOU1000000021_S0000167	GENESIS BELIEVES A PURE S CELL SAMPLE WILL STOP THEIR DEGRADATION, AND ONLY CLOUD AND ZACK BEAR THOSE RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000021_S0000168	HOLLANDER MAKES A GRAB FOR CLOUD, BUT ZACK PUTS AN END TO THE DOCTOR ONCE AND FOR ALL, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM FORMER DIRECTOR LAZAR.
YOU1000000021_S0000169	HE'S WHITE WINGED AND DEGRADING LIKE ANGEAL WITH HIS EXACT FACE, PRECISELY BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TURNED INTO AN ANGEAL COPY BY HIS OWN DOING.
YOU1000000021_S0000170	WHILE THE REAL ANGEAL REALLY IS DEAD, LAZARD FINDS HIMSELF WITH ANGEAL'S WILL TO SAVE ZACK AND OTHERS, WHICH MEANS THEY MUST STOP GENESIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.
YOU1000000021_S0000171	ALMOST TO MIDGAR, ZACK STOPS TO FINALLY CONFRONT THE FAILED AND TORTURED CREATION OF A JENOVA INFUSED HUMAN, WHO CONSIDERS ZACK A PERFECT FUSION OF ANGEAL'S WILL AND SEPHIROTH'S SUPERIOR CELLS.
YOU1000000021_S0000172	BEHIND HIM IS A STATUE TO THE GODDESS MINERVA, AS WELL AS A MASS OF MATERIA HE CLAIMS WILL RETURN EVERYONE TO THE LIFESTREAM.
YOU1000000021_S0000173	ZACK ATTEMPTS TO CALM GENESIS DOWN AND TRY TO HELP HIM REGAIN HIS HUMANITY, BUT GENESIS CHOOSES TO USE THE MATERIA'S POWER TO TRANSFORM INTO A MASSIVE ARMORED MONSTER.
YOU1000000021_S0000174	ZACK WINS OVER THIS FORM, REVERTING GENESIS TO HIS ORIGINAL FORM ONCE MORE, WHO IS NOW CURED OF HIS DEGRADATION THANKS TO THE MATERIA.
YOU1000000021_S0000175	ZACK SEES NO REASON TO FIGHT NOW, BUT GENESIS STILL INSISTS AND ZACK IS FRUSTRATED THAT ONCE AGAIN, HE HAS TO SHOULDER A BURDEN FORCED UPON HIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000176	CLASHING ONE FINAL TIME, HE KNOCKS GENESIS BACK, WHO FOR AN INSTANT, TURNS AROUND AND SEES THE GODDESS MINERVA AS HE ALWAYS IMAGINED, JUST BEFORE FALLING FOR GOOD IN THE LIFESTREAM, SIGNIFYING HIS FINAL DEFEAT.
YOU1000000021_S0000177	STILL HONORABLE, ZACK CARRIES A STILL BREATHING GENESIS AND LAYS HIM TO REST BESIDES CLOUD AND AN INJURED LIZARD.
YOU1000000021_S0000178	LAZARD SAYS THE WINGED ANGEAL COPY FROM BEFORE PROTECTED CLOUD FROM SHINRA EARLIER, BUT IT'S TOO LATE AS THE FINAL COPIES OF ANGEAL DIE AND RETURN TO THE LIVESTREAM, LEAVING ZACK AS HIS ONLY LIVING LEGACY.
YOU1000000021_S0000179	THE WINGED DOG ALSO HAD A LETTER FOR ZACK IN ITS POSSESSION, WHICH ZACK READS,
YOU1000000021_S0000180	IT TURNS OUT IT'S FROM AERITH, AND IT'S APPARENTLY BEEN 4 YEARS SINCE THEIR LAST MEETING, AND THIS HAS BEEN THE 89TH UNREQUITED LETTER SHE'S SENT HIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000181	SHE MENTIONS HER FLOWER SALES ARE DOING WELL THESE DAYS, AND DESPITE HER FEELINGS FOR HIM, THIS WOULD BE HER FINAL LETTER TO HIM.
YOU1000000021_S0000182	NATURALLY, ZACK IS UPSET TO LEARN HE'S BEEN UNCONSCIOUS FOR 4 YEARS, BUT STILL WANTS TO BE WITH AERITH AND MAKE THINGS RIGHT DESPITE HIS UNINTENDED ABSENCE.
YOU1000000021_S0000183	CARRYING CLOUD, HE HAS EVERY INTENTION TO GET BACK TO MIDGAR, SAVE CLOUD, AND REUNITE WITH AERITH.
YOU1000000021_S0000184	AFTER LEAVING GENESIS TO REST, GENESIS IS SOON SNATCHED AWAY BY TWO MYSTERIOUS SOLDIERS FOR HIS CLASS, NERO AND WEISS, WHO SEEK TO RECRUIT GENESIS INTO THEIR ORGANIZATION OF DEEPGROUND, PRECEDING EVENTS TO BE PLAYED OUT IN A FEATURE GAME, DIRGE OF CERBERUS.
YOU1000000021_S0000185	MEANWHILE, SUNG ORDERS SISNEY AND THE OTHER TURKS TO FIND AND SAVE ZACK BEFORE THE ARMY FINDS THEM, WHICH SISNEY IS VERY MOTIVATED TO DO.
YOU1000000021_S0000186	THOUGH THIS IS A MERE TREASONOUS ACTION, SONG IS WILLING TO RISK IT FOR HIS FRIEND, AND FOR AERITH'S SAKE.
YOU1000000021_S0000187	AT THE SAME TIME, ZACK AND CLOUD ARE IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK JUST OUTSIDE MIDGAR, AND EVEN THE TURKS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING THEM NOW.
YOU1000000021_S0000188	UNFORTUNATELY, THE ARMY INTERCEPTS ZACK FIRST, AND ZACK WILLINGLY CHOOSES TO FIGHT AND HONORABLY PROTECT CLOUD, DESPITE HIS OWN DESIRE TO RETURN TO AERITH AND SAVE HIMSELF.
YOU1000000021_S0000189	CLOUD ONLY NOW BEGINS TO WAKE UP OUT OF HIS MAKO POISONING, AS ZACK WALKS OUT TO FACE DOWN LITERALLY HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF SHINRA TROOPS AND ATTACK HELICOPTERS.
YOU1000000021_S0000190	COMMENTING THAT THE PRICE OF FREEDOM IS STEEP, ZACK GIVES A FINAL SALUTE AND PROMISE TO PROTECT HIS HONOR, AS HE TAKES ON SHINRA'S MILITARY SINGLE HANDEDLY.
YOU1000000021_S0000191	AS HE STANDS STRONG AGAINST THOUSANDS OF BLADES, BULLETS, AND MISSILES, ZACK IS PUSHED TO HIS LIMIT AS HE RECALLS THE BONDS HE HELD PRECIOUS IN LIFE.
YOU1000000021_S0000192	STARTING WITH HIS CLOSE FRIENDS WITHIN SHINRA, HE FONDLY RECALLS HIS FORMER HEROIC IDOL SEPHIROTH, AND TURKS SISNE AND SONG.
YOU1000000021_S0000193	THEN FINALLY, HIS CLOSEST BONDS, THOSE OF HIS FRIEND AND MENTOR ANGEAL, THE ASPIRING INFANTRYMAN CLOUD, AND HIS LOVE INTEREST AERITH.
YOU1000000021_S0000194	AGAINST ALL ODDS, ZACK TRIUMPHS IN HIS FINAL STAND, BUT HE IS ON HIS LAST LEGS AS SHINRA BEGINS REINFORCING THEIR TROOPS, FIRING COUNTLESS BULLETS INTO A RELENTLESS ZACK.
YOU1000000021_S0000195	EVENTUALLY, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AS HE CANNOT OVERCOME HIS WOUNDS ANYMORE, AND AFTER SOME NAMELESS INFANTRYMAN PUTS A FINAL BULLET INTO HIS HEAD,
YOU1000000021_S0000196	ZACK, THE RISING STAR OF SOLDIER FIRST CLASS, WITH DREAMS OF HEROISM DESPITE BEING DRAGGED INTO SO MANY OUTSIDE MESSES, TRAGICALLY FALLS FROM THOUGHTS OF ERID TO CARRY HIM INTO HIS FINAL MOMENTS.
YOU1000000021_S0000198	AS THE GAME CONCLUDES, ERIC NOTES A SUDDEN RAIN, AND IT SEEMS TO SENSE SOMETHING WRONG.
YOU1000000021_S0000199	MEANWHILE, CLOUD FINALLY WAKES UP AND DRAGS HIMSELF OVER TO ZACK, WHO IS STILL BARELY ALIVE, AND FORCES A SMILE FOR HIM AND URGES CLOUD TO LIVE ON IN HIS STEAD AS HIS OWN LIVING LEGACY.
YOU1000000021_S0000200	PASSING THE BUSTER SWORD ONTO CLOUD, HE ALSO PASSES ON HIS DREAM OF BEING A HERO FOR CLOUD TO FULFILL.
YOU1000000021_S0000201	CLOUD ACKNOWLEDGES THE PASSING OF THE TORCH AND ZACK HONORABLY DIES, THOUGH WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE.
YOU1000000021_S0000202	CLOUD THINKS IT AND PROMISES NOT TO FORGET AND WALKS AWAY, LEAVING ZACK'S BODY BEHIND.
YOU1000000021_S0000203	JOINING THE LIVESTREAM, ZACK IS GREETED BY HIS FRIEND ANGEO, WHO FINALLY NOW IS ABLE TO REST IN PEACE.
YOU1000000021_S0000204	AS THE GAME ENDS, THE TRAUMA OF THE EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY RESULTED IN CLOUD BLOCKING ALL MEMORY OF ZACK DESPITE HIS PROMISE.
YOU1000000021_S0000205	HIS DELIRIUM ACTUALLY HAS HIM BELIEVING HE IS ZACK IN ALL BUT NAME, AS THE GAME LEADS UP TO THE ORIGINAL INSTALLMENT, FINAL FANTASY VII.
YOU1000000021_S0000206	CRISIS CORE FINAL FANTASY VII HAS ENJOYED THE SUCCESS OF SELLING OVER 6.5 MILLION COPIES WORLDWIDE.

YOU1000000027_S0000003	SO THIS ONE'S PRETTY SIMPLE. I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES LIKE THAT. SO IF IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO FIND THINGS THAT YOU LOVE ABOUT YOURSELF, WHY DON'T YOU START WITH THINGS THAT YOU LIKE? WHAT PERSONALITY TRAITS THAT YOU LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF?
YOU1000000027_S0000004	OR YOU COULD ASK SOME FRIENDS WHAT THEY THINK YOUR BEST QUALITIES ARE AND THEN START FROM THERE. THE NEXT JOURNALING PROMPT IS TO TAKE SOME TIME TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LOVE LETTER TO YOURSELF. NOW I KNOW I'VE SHARED THAT ONE BEFORE BECAUSE I LOVE IT SO MUCH.
YOU1000000027_S0000005	BUT THE FUN HOOK IS, YOU CAN DO IT ON THIS WEBSITE CALLED FUTURE ME, WHERE YOU SEND THAT LOVE LETTER TO YOURSELF FOR NEXT YEAR'S VALENTINE'S DAY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

YOU1000000027_S0000007	BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE FUN PART IS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SENDING IT BACK TO YOURSELF A YEAR LATER FOR NEXT YEAR'S VALENTINE'S DAY,
YOU1000000027_S0000008	THEN YOU'RE GONNA GET A LITTLE SURPRISE IN A YEAR. AND MAYBE YOU CAN DO THIS EVERY YEAR SO THAT YOU SEND YOURSELF A LOVE LETTER EVERY YEAR FOR VALENTINE'S DAY BECAUSE, DUH, SELF LOVE IS SUPER IMPORTANT AND YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH OF IT.
YOU1000000027_S0000009	ALRIGHT, THE NEXT JOURNALING PROMPT IS SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY FRIEND KAJO PANDAY THIS PAST SUNDAY, ACTUALLY. WE DID A LIVE CHAT TOGETHER ON FACEBOOK. IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THAT FULL LIVE CHAT, IT'S REALLY AMAZING.

YOU1000000027_S0000011	LIST ALL THOSE TRAITS THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF EITHER WORRYING ABOUT OR COMPLAINING ABOUT. ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH YOURSELF, LIST THOSE TRAITS AND THEN ADD, BUT I LOVE MYSELF ANYWAY AT THE END.
YOU1000000027_S0000012	SO FOR EXAMPLE, I FEEL LAZY AND UNMOTIVATED TODAY, BUT I LOVE MYSELF ANYWAY. OR I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL PRETTY OR CONFIDENT WHEN I'M IN A SOCIAL SETTING, BUT I LOVE MYSELF ANYWAY.
YOU1000000027_S0000013	OR, I THINK THAT I TALK TOO MUCH, BUT I LOVE MYSELF ANYWAY. DO YOU SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE? YOU'RE TAKING A TRAIT THAT IS KIND OF SEEN AS NEGATIVE IN YOUR HEAD, THOSE TRAITS THAT YOU'RE USUALLY LIKE, UGH, WHY AM I LIKE THIS?
YOU1000000027_S0000014	OR I DON'T LIKE THIS PART ABOUT ME. BASICALLY THE TRAITS WHERE YOU'RE BEING JUDGMENTAL ON YOURSELF OR HARD ON YOURSELF, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO ALL THE TIME. AND THEN JUST LISTING IT OUT, BEING HONEST ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000027_S0000015	AND THEN END IT WITH, BUT I LOVE MYSELF ANYWAY. SO THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO LEARN TO LOVE ALL THAT YOU ARE, THE GOOD PARTS AND THE BAD PARTS, OR THE STRENGTHS AND THE WEAKNESSES, BECAUSE LOVE IS UNCONDITIONAL.
YOU1000000027_S0000016	LOVE ENCOMPASSES ALL. SO I KNOW WE STARTED OUT WITH THE THINGS THAT YOU DO LOVE ABOUT YOURSELF. AND THIS IS ANOTHER WAY TO KIND OF BE HONEST ABOUT THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF, AND YET YOU LOVE YOURSELF ANYWAY.
YOU1000000027_S0000017	BECAUSE NOBODY IS PERFECT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE IN YOUR LIFE, THEY'RE NOT PERFECT. THEY HAVE FLAWS. THEY HAVE TIMES THAT THEY MAKE MISTAKES, AND YET YOU LOVE THEM ANYWAY.
YOU1000000027_S0000018	SO LEARN TO TREAT YOURSELF IN THAT WAY. LIKE, YES, I MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS CHARACTERISTIC ABOUT MYSELF, OR I MIGHT FEEL THIS WAY THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT ME, BUT I LOVE MYSELF ANYWAY.
YOU1000000027_S0000019	IT'S JUST LEARNING TO BE UNCONDITIONAL WITH YOUR LOVE. IT'S SO GREAT, RIGHT? LIKE I SAID, IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THAT FULL VIDEO WITH KAJOL, I'LL LINK THAT VIDEO DOWN BELOW SO YOU CAN CATCH UP.
YOU1000000027_S0000020	NEXT I'M GOING TO SHARE SOME JOURNALING PROMPTS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY ASK YOURSELF EVERY DAY IN THE MORNING, JUST TO GET YOURSELF OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT, BECAUSE EVERY DAY YOU WANT TO BE LISTENING TO YOURSELF AND DOING WHAT SERVES YOU BEST.
YOU1000000027_S0000021	SO AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY DAY, YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS LIKE, WHAT AM I EXCITED TO DO TODAY? OR HOW CAN I GIVE MYSELF THAT EXTRA CARE TODAY? BECAUSE I'M ALL ABOUT SELF CARE, GUYS. AND LASTLY, WHAT CAN I DO TO PROTECT MY ENERGY?
YOU1000000027_S0000022	AND I LOVE THAT LAST QUESTION. I ACTUALLY HAVE THAT QUESTION IN MY WORKBOOK TOO, BECAUSE IT'S LIKE BEING AWARE OF HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOUR ENERGY IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWING TOXIC PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU1000000027_S0000023	OR YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING YES TO PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A PEOPLE PLEASER. A LOT OF TIMES, FOR ME PERSONALLY, IT'S HARD TO SAY NO. BUT IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY ENERGY AND MY WELL BEING, I HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO MORE OFTEN.
YOU1000000027_S0000024	SO THAT I DON'T FIND MYSELF IN THOSE AWKWARD SITUATIONS WHERE I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT I DON'T WANT TO BE DOING, BUT I SAID YES, SO I HAVE TO DO IT. AND IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL GOOD. YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOURSELF IN THOSE SITUATIONS.
YOU1000000027_S0000025	BUT YEAH, I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD START ON JOURNALING PROMPTS THAT YOU CAN DO TODAY TO CULTIVATE MORE SELF LOVE IN YOUR LIFE. ALSO, AS YOU'RE CHECKING OUT THAT LIVE CHAT VIDEO ON MY FACEBOOK, JUST GO AHEAD AND LIKE MY FACEBOOK PAGE WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.
YOU1000000027_S0000026	BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE DOING MORE LIVE CHATS HERE AND THERE, AND I'M JUST GOING TO TRY TO POST MORE VIDEOS ON FACEBOOK AND BE MORE ACTIVE THERE.
YOU1000000027_S0000027	ALRIGHT, I HOPE YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL VALENTINE'S DAY. I WILL SEE YOU GUYS IN THE NEXT ONE. BYE!

YOU1000000032_S0000009	THE DETERMINATION AND COMPASSION OF OUR FOUNDERS DRIVES AMERICARES TODAY.
YOU1000000032_S0000011	THE BOB AND LILA MCCAULEY HUMANITARIAN SPIRIT AWARD CELEBRATES EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENT AND COURAGE TO HELP OTHERS.

YOU1000000032_S0000014	DOCTOR GUPTA HAS SET A HIGH BAR AS A CARING LEADER AND HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO HELPING OTHERS.
YOU1000000033_S0000001	CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL IT? THE CONFLICT IS BECOMING APPARENT IN OUR CULTURE.
YOU1000000033_S0000002	IT REMINDS ME OF THOSE WORDS OF JOHN PAUL II, WE'RE NOW LIVING IN THE FINAL CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE GOSPEL AND THE ANTI GOSPEL, BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE ANTI CHURCH, BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE ANTICHRIST.
YOU1000000033_S0000004	AND IF WE DON'T CHOOSE TO KNOW GOD'S WORD, TO BELIEVE GOD'S WORD, TO FOLLOW GOD'S WORD, WE'RE GOING TO BE A SITTING DUCK FOR ALL KINDS OF CONFUSION, ALL KINDS OF DISORDER. THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CHOICES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE.
YOU1000000033_S0000006	AND THESE CHOICES ARE DIFFICULT. WHO AM I GOING TO MARRY? WHAT KIND OF LIFE AM I GOING TO LIVE? HOW AM I GOING TO RAISE MY KIDS? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MY TIME, MY TALENT, AND MY TREASURE?
YOU1000000033_S0000008	AND I HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE TODAY. JESUS SAYS TO EACH ONE OF US, I CAME THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE AND HAVE IT TO THE FULL. THE QUESTION IS, DO WE WANT IT?
YOU1000000033_S0000010	HEY, WELCOME TO ANOTHER WEEK OF THE CHOICES WE FACE. WE HAVE A SPECIAL THING FOR YOU TODAY. WE'RE CELEBRATING SO MANY YEARS THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED US IN RENEWAL MINISTRIES. WE PUT TOGETHER A SPECIAL VIDEO TELLING US ABOUT THE RENEWAL MINISTRIES STORY.
YOU1000000033_S0000011	YEAH, AND IT'S GOOD. IT'S REALLY GOOD.
YOU1000000033_S0000012	LET'S WATCH IT!
YOU1000000033_S0000013	YEP.
YOU1000000033_S0000015	WHAT WE'RE PRIMARILY TRYING TO COMMUNICATE TO THE WORLD IS JESUS, THE HOLY NAME OF JESUS, THE ONLY NAME GIVEN BY WHICH HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE SAVED, GOD THE FATHER.
YOU1000000033_S0000016	THE CLOUDS ARE OPENING AGAIN AND HE'S SAYING TO THE WORLD, THIS IS MY BELOVED SON, OF WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED. LISTEN TO HIM. ALL WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS, LISTEN TO HIM.
YOU1000000033_S0000017	LOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT THE GIFT THAT GOD THE FATHER IS GIVING US. LOOK AT THE PRICE THAT JESUS CHRIST PAID FOR US ON THE CROSS. LOOK AT HOW MUCH HE LOVES US. LISTEN TO HIM. PAY ATTENTION TO HIM. JOIN YOUR LIFE WITH HIM.
YOU1000000033_S0000019	POST VATICAN II, THERE WERE MANY UPHEAVALS AND CHANGES THAT WENT ON, BOTH IN THE CHURCH AND OUTSIDE THE CHURCH AND AGAINST THE CHURCH AND FOR THE CHURCH, AND IT WAS A WHIRLWIND.
YOU1000000033_S0000020	AND I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT MY FAITH WASN'T NEARLY AS STRONG AS I THOUGHT IT WAS. HERE I WAS A RELIGIOUS SISTER, HERE I WAS VOWED TO HIM, AND MY FAITH WAS VERY, VERY SHAKEN.
YOU1000000033_S0000021	AND IT WAS SHAKING BECAUSE THERE WERE JUST SO MANY THEORIES BEING THROWN AT US OR THINGS THAT WE HAD BELIEVED OR SEEMED TO BE IN CONCRETE WERE SUDDENLY UP FOR QUESTION. AND I REALIZED THAT I WASN'T ROOTED DEEPLY ENOUGH.
YOU1000000033_S0000022	YET I HAD HAD A GOOD EDUCATION, I HAD HAD RELIGIOUS FORMATION, BUT SOMETHING HADN'T TRANSMITTED FROM HERE TO HERE.
YOU1000000033_S0000023	YEAH, WELL LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE I CAUGHT UP IN THE CONFUSION OF OUR CULTURE, MORAL CONFUSION, INTELLECTUAL CONFUSION, AND THEN A FRIEND INVITED ME TO MAKE A RETREAT WHEN I WAS A SENIOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
YOU1000000033_S0000024	I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT. I FELT LIKE I WAS A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR. I FELT LIKE, GEE, I KIND OF KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS. AND THEN I JUST HEARD THIS MOST AMAZING STORY ABOUT THE CATHOLIC FAITH AND HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS. BUT THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.
YOU1000000033_S0000025	I REALLY EXPERIENCED THE PERSONAL PRESENCE OF CHRIST ON THAT RETREAT. I FELT LIKE HE WAS ADDRESSING ME. I DIDN'T HEAR ANY WORDS, BUT I JUST KNEW HE WAS THERE, AND I JUST KNEW THAT I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HIM. WAS HE WHO HE SAID HE WAS OR NOT?
YOU1000000033_S0000026	WHEN I WAS 20 YEARS OLD IN 1978, MY SISTER CONVINCED ME TO GO TO A CONFERENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME. AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE NOTRE DAME, TOUCHDOWN JESUS, I THOUGHT I'LL GO.
YOU1000000033_S0000027	35,000 CATHOLICS, ABOUT 200 PRIESTS AND BISHOPS. IT WAS A CATHOLIC CHARISMATIC RENEWAL EVENT.
YOU1000000033_S0000028	AND WHEN I GOT THERE, I REALIZED I WAS IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON IN THE STADIUM. I MEAN, EVERYBODY SEEMED TO JUST BE SO ALIVE AND ANIMATED IN THEIR FAITH.
YOU1000000033_S0000029	I WAS A PRETTY NOMINAL CATHOLIC AT THAT POINT. I'D SEEN GOD DO SOME AMAZING THINGS IN MY FAMILY, BUT ESSENTIALLY THAT WEEKEND I BEGAN TO SEARCH AND TO HUNGER.
YOU1000000033_S0000030	IF HE REALLY WAS THE SON OF GOD, IF HE REALLY WAS ALIVE, IF HE REALLY WAS PRESENT, I KNEW THAT MY SEARCH HAD JUST COME TO AN END. UNEXPECTEDLY SOON, I THOUGHT I'D BE SEARCHING FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, BUT THERE HE WAS.
YOU1000000033_S0000031	AND BY THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD, I WAS ABLE TO SWALLOW MY PRIDE AND REPENT AND GO TO CONFESSION AND REALLY SURRENDER MY LIFE TO THE LORD. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'M JUST PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL FOR GOD'S MERCY TO ME AND HELPING ME FIND HIM WHEN I DID.
YOU1000000033_S0000032	I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'D BE TODAY WITHOUT HIM.
YOU1000000033_S0000033	AND SO I WAS INSPIRED TO CALL A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS A CARMELITE SISTER. I TALKED TO HER AND AFTER WE TALKED FOR 15 OR 20 MINUTES SHE SAID TO ME,
YOU1000000033_S0000035	WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
YOU1000000033_S0000037	AND I SAID, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU1000000033_S0000039	BUT I WANT TO GIVE MY LIFE TO GOD IN A WAY I NEVER HAVE BEFORE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I'VE GIVEN HIM MY WHOLE LIFE. HE HAS MY VOWS. I'M VOWED TO HIM. WHAT MORE CAN I GIVE HIM?
YOU1000000033_S0000040	AND HER RESPONSE WAS VERY WISE. WE WERE THE SAME AGE, BUT HER RESPONSE WAS VERY WISE. SHE SAID TO ME, THEN JUST TELL HIM THAT.
YOU1000000033_S0000042	SO I WENT HOME AND WALKED INTO THE CHAPEL AND SAID, LORD, I WANT TO GIVE MY LIFE TO YOU IN A WAY I NEVER HAVE BEFORE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT YOU HAVE IT, WHATEVER THAT IS.
YOU1000000033_S0000044	I WALKED OUT OF THE CHAPEL AND
YOU1000000033_S0000046	NOTHING, NO BELLS AND WHISTLES, AS THEY SAY TODAY, YOU KNOW, NOTHING LIKE THAT. I JUST WALKED OUT OF THE CHAPEL AND STARTED UP THE STAIRS. I WAS GOING TO CORRECT PAPERS.
YOU1000000033_S0000047	AND AS I WAS WALKING UP THE STAIRS, AS I OFTEN SAY, IF I COULD GO INTO THAT CONVENT TODAY, I COULD TELL YOU THE EXACT STEP WHERE I WAS.
YOU1000000033_S0000048	WHEN IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY TOOK A PICTURE OF WATER.
YOU1000000033_S0000050	AND POURED IT OVER MY HEAD.
YOU1000000033_S0000052	AND
YOU1000000033_S0000054	THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCE.
YOU1000000033_S0000056	BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID.
YOU1000000033_S0000058	AND I WAS CYNICAL. I WAS STILL PRETTY CYNICAL. AND SO I TOOK A FEW MORE STEPS UP AND I SAID, GOD, IS THIS YOU?
YOU1000000033_S0000060	WHAT IS THIS?
YOU1000000033_S0000062	AND HE SAID, IT IS MY HOLY SPIRIT.
YOU1000000033_S0000064	HOW DID I HEAR NO AUDIBLE VOICE, JUST A THOUGHT GOES THROUGH YOUR HEAD THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT YOUR OWN?
YOU1000000033_S0000066	HE SAID, THIS IS MY HOLY SPIRIT. AND THE JOY THAT CAME INTO MY LIFE IN THAT MOMENT HAS NEVER GONE.
YOU1000000033_S0000068	WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST TURNED MY LIFE OVER TO THE LORD WHEN I WAS A SENIOR AT NOTRE DAME, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PLANS TO GO INTO MINISTRY.
YOU1000000033_S0000069	I JUST KNEW I HAD MET GOD AND THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE. SO I WENT OFF TO GRAD SCHOOL TO PRINCETON AND THEN I TOOK A LEAVE FROM GRAD SCHOOL TO BEGIN WORKING FOR THE CURCIO MOVEMENT.
YOU1000000033_S0000070	AND THEN I GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHARISMATIC RENEWAL MOVEMENT, AND THEN CARDINAL SUNIS ASKED ME TO MOVE TO BELGIUM. SO IT ISN'T LIKE I HAD A PLAN.
YOU1000000033_S0000071	I TRY NOT TO PUT ANY LIMITS ON THE LORD. I'M TRYING NOT TO HAVE ANY PRESUPPOSITIONS. I'M TRYING TO EACH DAY GET UP AND DO WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST PLEASING THING TO HIM.
YOU1000000033_S0000072	SO THEN THE LAST, THE CLOSING OF THE EVENT WAS A BIG LITURGY IN THE FOOTBALL STADIUM. AND I WAS BEGGING THE LORD IN MY HEART.
YOU1000000033_S0000073	PLEASE HELP ME. GIVE ME THE FAITH. GIVE ME THE LOVE. GIVE ME SOMETHING BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO RESIST SIN, ESSENTIALLY, AND TO REALLY LIVE FOR YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY.
YOU1000000033_S0000074	AND I WENT TO COMMUNION, CAME BACK FROM COMMUNION, I WAS STANDING IN MY PLACE, AND THIS GUY COMES UP TO ME AND HE'S GOT HIS NAME TAG ON, HE'S FROM INDIANAPOLIS, GUY MAYBE IN HIS MID 40S AT THE TIME, I WAS 20.
YOU1000000033_S0000075	AND HE SAID TO ME, HE SAID, SON, HE LOOKED AT MY NAME TAG, HE SAID, PETER, DO YOU MIND IF I SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU? AND I SAID, SURE. HE SAID, I'M BACK HERE ABOUT SIX ROWS AND I WAS GOING TO COMMUNION AND I SAW YOU AND MY EYES FELL ON YOU.
YOU1000000033_S0000076	AND I FELT THE HOLY SPIRIT TOUCH MY HEART AND SAY, YOU GO TELL THAT YOUNG MAN THAT THE FAITH AND LOVE THAT HE'S SEEKING SHALL BE GRANTED TO HIM BECAUSE CHRIST LOVES HIM AND HAS DIED FOR HIM.
YOU1000000033_S0000077	AND AS SOON AS HE SAID THAT IT WAS LIKE A BOMB WENT OFF
YOU1000000033_S0000079	THE GRACE OF GOD TOUCHED ME IN A NEW WAY AND I PUT MY ARMS AROUND THE GUY AND WE STOOD THERE AND JUST SQUEEZED HIM AND I CRIED LIKE A BABY ON HIS SHOULDER AND I FELT
YOU1000000033_S0000080	I FELT IN MY SPIRIT AND I THINK THAT'S THE DAY I EXPERIENCED THE CALLING FOR WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW. AND AS THIS GUY'S HOLDING ME, I'M JUST EXPERIENCING A TREMENDOUS SENSE OF THE LOVE OF GOD POURING INTO ME.
YOU1000000033_S0000081	AND THE LORDSHIP AND THE MAJESTY OF JESUS CHRIST, THAT HE'S THE LORD, ALL POWER AND AUTHORITY BELONGS TO HIM. AND HE SAID, MY SON, I'M CALLING YOU. TRUST ME.
YOU1000000033_S0000082	AND THEN I LOOKED AROUND AND IT SEEMED LIKE PEOPLE WERE GETTING TOUCHED EVERYWHERE LIKE THAT. AND I FELT IN MY HEART LIKE THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS SAYING, WELCOME, THE REIGN OF GOD IS AT HAND. YOU'RE PART OF THE KINGDOM. THE KINGDOM'S ALIVE BECAUSE THE KING IS ALIVE. AND I WENT HOME. MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED AFTER THAT.
YOU1000000033_S0000084	I BEGAN WITH RENEWAL MINISTRIES BACK IN—ACTUALLY, I KNEW RALPH FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND WE SPOKE AT SOME CONFERENCES TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY HAD SOMEWHAT OF A COMMON MIND.
YOU1000000033_S0000085	AND THEN PETER CAME INTO THE PICTURE AS WELL. AND THE THREE OF US, JUST AT DIFFERENT TIMES COLLABORATING AT A CONFERENCE SOMEWHERE, WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT WE ALL HAD A KIND OF SIMILAR MESSAGE.
YOU1000000033_S0000086	I SAW RALPH MARTIN ON THAT CONFERENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. HE WAS A SPEAKER, 1978.
YOU1000000033_S0000087	THERE'S A LOT OF SPEAKERS, BUT WHEN HE SPOKE THAT SATURDAY AFTERNOON, HE SPOKE LIKE THE PROPHET ELIJAH. FOR SOME REASON, IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME LIKE A SWORD AND BROUGHT TREMENDOUS CONVICTION TO ME.
YOU1000000033_S0000088	THAT'S PARTLY WHAT I WAS PRAYING FOR, WAS THAT KIND OF CONVICTION. AND THAT CARRIED THROUGH FOR ME AS I LEFT THAT PLACE. I BOUGHT EVERY TAPE, EVERY BOOK I COULD FIND OF HIS, AND I READ IT, AND I GOT OTHER GUYS TO DO IT WITH ME.
YOU1000000033_S0000089	AND WE WOULD LITERALLY SPEND FRIDAY NIGHTS, SOME FRIDAY NIGHTS IN COLLEGE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, AND WE WOULD LISTEN TO THESE TALKS AND IT WOULD REALLY BURN IN US. AND WE'D GET ON OUR KNEES, WE'D GET ON OUR FACE IN THE CARPET, AND WE'D SAY, LORD JESUS, WHAT YOU PUT IN HIM, PUT IN US.
YOU1000000033_S0000090	AND HE DID THAT.
YOU1000000033_S0000091	WELL, WE ALL HAD A REALLY STRONG ENCOUNTER WITH THE LORD IN DIFFERENT WAYS THROUGH THE CATHOLIC CHARISMATIC RENEWAL. WE ALL ENDED UP HERE IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN AS PART OF A COVENANT COMMUNITY, AND WE KNEW EACH OTHER THERE.
YOU1000000033_S0000092	BUT THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT IN 1989, THINGS WERE KIND OF HAPPENING AND CHANGING AROUND US.
YOU1000000033_S0000093	AND WE FOUND OURSELVES DRAWN TOGETHER AND WE FELT LIKE THE LORD WAS CALLING US TO MEET EVERY WEEK FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF PRAYER AND JUST REALLY ASKING THE LORD WHAT HE WANTED FOR US. AND FROM THAT CAME A MUCH CLOSER COLLABORATION.
YOU1000000033_S0000094	HOW IT ALL BEGAN, I DON'T KNOW IF RALPH MENTIONED THIS, BUT KIND OF HOW IT ALL BEGAN WAS HE AND I WENT TO HEAR A TALK IN DETROIT AT A LARGE CONFERENCE. WE CAME TO HEAR ONE SPEAKER AT THIS LARGER CONFERENCE.
YOU1000000033_S0000096	AND WE HEARD THE SPEAKER WAS GOOD, WE'RE GETTING READY TO LEAVE. THE GUY WHO WAS EMCEEING THE EVENT WAS MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS JUST BEFORE LUNCH AND HE MADE ALL HIS ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HE SAID,
YOU1000000033_S0000097	BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANTED TO MENTION OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM UP HERE AND OUR PROPHECY TEAM FEEL CALLED TO PRAY FOR TWO MEN WHO ARE HERE TODAY. THERE'S ABOUT 1,500 PEOPLE IN THE CROWD AND THEY POINTED US OUT AND WE WEREN'T EVEN MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE. WE DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE TALKING TO US.
YOU1000000033_S0000098	AND EVENTUALLY THEY SAID, IT'S YOU TWO, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO HAVE OUR TEAM PRAY WITH YOU? AND WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID, ALL RIGHT, WHY NOT? AND SO EVERYBODY GOT EXCUSED FOR LUNCH. WE WENT UP THERE WITH THE TEAM AND A MATURE GROUP OF PEOPLE.
YOU1000000033_S0000099	AND THEY STARTED PRAYING FOR US WITH RALPH AND I'M JUST KIND OF WATCHING. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WHERE I SAW THE GIFT OF PROPHECY, KIND OF, AND WORD OF KNOWLEDGE WORKING IN A VERY POWERFUL WAY.
YOU1000000033_S0000100	AND THEY STARTED SAYING THINGS ABOUT RALPH AND ABOUT HIS LIFE WHICH THEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WERE INDICATIONS OF HOW GOD HAD WORKED IN HIM AND WHAT THE LORD WANTED TO DO WITH HIM.
YOU1000000033_S0000101	AND SO I'M THINKING, WHOA, THIS IS PROBABLY GETTING A LITTLE TOO CLOSE. I DON'T THINK I WANT TO LISTEN. I THINK I WANT TO GO BEFORE IT'S MY TURN KIND OF THING. AND SO ANYWAY, THEY PRAYED OVER ME AND THEY SAID, ONE PERSON SAID, THE LORD'S GOING TO START SOWING YOU INTO LANDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU1000000033_S0000103	AND HE'S GOING TO BRING TO YOU MEN AND WOMEN WHO HE'S ALREADY CALLED AND HE'S ALREADY EMPOWERED TO BE ABLE TO STAND ALONGSIDE YOU." AND THE ONE PERSON SAID, YEAH, I SEE THESE IMAGES OF BATTLESHIPS ALL LINED UP.
YOU1000000033_S0000104	AND THEY'RE ALL EQUIPPED AND THEY'RE ALL READY TO GO AND THE LORD WANTS YOU TO LAUNCH THEM. AND THOSE BATTLESHIPS ARE PEOPLE AND BISHOPS AND PRIESTS AND LAY PEOPLE THAT GOD HAS CALLED TO GO TO THE WORLD TO ENGAGE THE NEW EVANGELIZATION AND HE WANTS YOU GUYS TO HELP LAUNCH THEM.
YOU1000000033_S0000105	AND SO AFTER IT WAS ALL DONE, WE WERE DRIVING HOME AND SAYING, WOW, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT? AND RALPH JUST SAID, YOU KNOW, SCRIPTURE IS VERY CLEAR. IT SAYS, TO NEVER DESPISE PROPHECY, BUT TEST EVERYTHING AND CLING TO WHAT IS GOOD.
YOU1000000033_S0000106	SO WE BEGAN TO PRAY ONCE A WEEK TOGETHER, TO SAY, LORD, IF THIS IS YOU, WE'RE READY TO RECEIVE IT. IF IT'S NOT YOU, WE WEREN'T WORKING TOGETHER AT THAT TIME. WE WERE JUST, WE WERE IN THE SAME COMMUNITY, THE SAME PARISH. WE WEREN'T, RENEWAL MINISTRIES HADN'T YET HAPPENED WITH US TOGETHER.
YOU1000000033_S0000107	AND SO WE DECIDED TO PRAY AND THEN WE INVITED SISTER ANN AND A FEW OTHERS ONCE A WEEK TO PRAY WITH US. WE PRAY EACH WEEK AND TRY TO LISTEN. AND WEEK AFTER WEEK WE'D SAY, ANYBODY HEARING ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, FROM THE LORD? NO. WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO? NO.
YOU1000000033_S0000108	AND THEN AT ONE POINT, A COUPLE OF MONTHS INTO IT, SISTER ANN SHIELDS SAID, AT THE END OF THE PRAYER TIME, SHE GOES, THIS SOUNDS KIND OF STRANGE, YOU GUYS, BUT I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO LITHUANIA AND UKRAINE.
YOU1000000033_S0000109	SO HERE WE'RE IN THE BASEMENT OF A HOUSE HERE IN ANN ARBOR. SISTER ANN GETS A SENSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO LITHUANIA. WE DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THERE. TWO WEEKS LATER, THE BISHOP OF THE CULTURAL CENTER OF THE COUNTRY CALLS US AND SAID, WOULD YOU COME AND HELP ME?
YOU1000000033_S0000110	AND WHAT WE HAD HEARD PROPHETICALLY FROM FOLKS WHO PRAYED FOR US SAID, ONLY GO THROUGH DOORS THAT GOD'S GOING TO OPEN. HE WILL OPEN THE DOORS FOR YOU. IT STARTED IN LITHUANIA, AND THEN IT WENT TO SLOVAKIA, AND THEN IT WENT TO HUNGARY, AND THEN IT WENT TO UKRAINE, AND NOW IT'S 40 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU1000000033_S0000112	AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW IT ALL HAPPENED. AND WE STARTED, ONCE WE STARTED, WE SAID, OKAY, CLEARLY GOD'S CALLING US. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? SO WE FORMED AN ORGANIZATION, RENEWAL MINISTRIES. THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.
YOU1000000033_S0000114	THIS THOUGHT CAME INTO MY HEAD, I WANT YOU ON CATHOLIC RADIO.
YOU1000000033_S0000116	AND CATHOLIC RADIO
YOU1000000033_S0000118	DIDN'T EXIST EXCEPT FOR SOME WORK AT EWTN, BUT THAT WAS IT.
YOU1000000033_S0000120	AND IT WAS JUST, I WANT YOU ON CATHOLIC RADIO. AND I THOUGHT,
YOU1000000033_S0000121	SO I WENT TO RALPH, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GET SOME THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IS IT INDIGESTION OR IS IT A WORD FROM THE LORD? AND I SAID, LOOK, RALPH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF CATHOLIC RADIO EXISTS.
YOU1000000033_S0000123	AND HE SAID, WELL, LET'S JUST PRAY.
YOU1000000033_S0000125	AND SIX MONTHS LATER, I GOT THIS CALL FROM EWTN ASKING ME IF I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO A RADIO PROGRAM ON THEIR STATION. AND I SAID, YES.
YOU1000000033_S0000126	AND THEY SAID, DON'T YOU NEED TO TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT THIS? OR DON'T YOU NEED TO PRAY ABOUT THIS? AND I SAID,
YOU1000000033_S0000127	NO, I THINK THE LORD PREPARED ME AND RALPH HAD SAID, JUST PRAY. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND WE'LL KNOW THIS IS FROM THE LORD.
YOU1000000033_S0000128	MY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY HAD PRAYED ABOUT IT, KNEW ABOUT IT, SO WHEN THE INVITATION CAME IT WAS LIKE ALL THE GROUNDWORK HAD BEEN LAID. SO FROM THEN ON, THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING.
YOU1000000033_S0000129	SPEAKING, WRITING, PARISH MISSIONS, ALL OF THAT, AND THEN PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON THE RADIO.
YOU1000000033_S0000130	WE GOT INTO RADIO, WHICH WE HADN'T PLANNED AT THE BEGINNING. SISTER ANN PROGRAMMED FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY, WHICH IS ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S A VERY DYNAMIC RADIO SHOW.
YOU1000000033_S0000131	AND THEN A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT, I FELT, I WAS IN A MEETING WITH RALPH JUST CATCHING UP, SEEING HOW THINGS ARE GOING. HE SAID, WHAT'S THE LORD SAYING TO YOU THESE DAYS? AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, CRAZY, I THINK I'M SUPPOSED TO DO RADIO.
YOU1000000033_S0000132	WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY FOR IT.
YOU1000000033_S0000134	LET'S JUST SEE WHAT THE LORD DOES, IF YOU'RE WILLING. SO WE PRAYED AND THEN ABOUT A WEEK LATER I GOT A CALL FROM MIKE JONES FROM AVE MARIA RADIO, OUT OF THE BLUE. AND HE SAID, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT DOING RADIO?
YOU1000000033_S0000135	I SAID, YEAH, IN FACT I HAVE. AND HE SAID, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO A SHOW WITH US? I SAID, I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. HE SAID, WELL, WE'LL DO IT. WE'LL PRODUCE IT. JUST COME AND DO THE SHOW. SO STEP BY STEP, THINGS LIKE THAT BEGAN TO HAPPEN.
YOU1000000033_S0000136	CROSSING THE GOLD EMERGED, ANOTHER TELEVISION SHOW ON EWTN THAT WE COLLABORATE TOGETHER WITH THE TEAM, DANNY ABRAMOWITZ, CURTIS MARTIN, AND A VARIETY OF FOLKS. A SHOW THAT WAS GEARED TOWARD MEN.
YOU1000000033_S0000137	AND AGAIN, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN MY HEART FOR YEARS BEFORE. I FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID,
YOU1000000033_S0000139	YOU GOTTA START WORKING TO REACH MEN AND CHALLENGE THEM TO DARE TO BELIEVE AND TO GO FOR IT. I TRIED A FEW THINGS AND NOTHING REALLY TOOK OFF.
YOU1000000033_S0000140	BUT IT WAS STILL IN MY HEART, OUT OF THE BLUE, DANNY AND I MET EACH OTHER AT BRAMOWITZ. OUR DESIRES AND MINISTRY WERE SO COMMON, WE ENDED UP COMBINING TOGETHER, CREATING THIS OTHER SHOW. SO THAT'S EMERGED.
YOU1000000033_S0000141	ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS AND HAVE DONE FROM THE BEGINNING IS FIND A WAY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE MORE LAY PEOPLE DIRECTLY IN MINISTRY AND EVANGELIZATION.
YOU1000000033_S0000142	SO RAISED UP MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO WORK WITH US INTERNATIONALLY ON MISSION TEAMS GOING ALL OVER THE WORLD, OUR COUNTRY COORDINATORS WE CALL THEM.
YOU1000000033_S0000143	AND THEN THE LAST FEW YEARS, WITH A HEART FOR MILLENNIALS, WE JUST FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID, THERE'S A, IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA HERE, THERE ARE LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SERIOUS CALL IN THEIR LIFE FROM THE LORD, AND THEY'VE REALLY GROWN A LOT.
YOU1000000033_S0000144	AND THEY JUST HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT AND FORMATION IN THEIR LIFE. AND WE FELT LIKE THE LORD SAID, HELP RELEASE THEM INTO WHAT I'VE CALLED THEM TO DO. MAKE A WAY FOR THEM, MAKE A PATH. AND SO THAT'S PARTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE TOO. THAT'S WHERE ID 916, THE YOUNG ADULT MINISTRY EMERGED FROM.
YOU1000000033_S0000145	ONE OF THE REALLY THINGS THE LORD HAS CALLED ALL OF US TO, PETER AND SISTER ANN AND MYSELF, IS TO EXPRESS IN WRITING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE FEEL LIKE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTHS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR RIGHT NOW IN OUR CULTURE.
YOU1000000033_S0000146	AND SO, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME WAS REALLY FINISHING A BOOK THAT I WORKED ON FOR 10 YEARS. IT'S CALLED THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL DESIRE, A GUIDEBOOK FOR THE JOURNEY TO GOD BASED ON THE WISDOM OF THE SAINTS.
YOU1000000033_S0000147	I JUST REALLY FELT LIKE THERE'S SUCH A TREASURE OF WISDOM IN OUR CHURCH, IN THESE GREAT DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH. BUT LIKE IT USED TO HAPPEN TO ME YEARS AGO, THE FIRST TIME I PICKED UP A BOOK BY JOHN OF THE CROSS, IT WAS LIKE, WHAT?
YOU1000000033_S0000148	WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? AND WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS SO SCARY, I DECIDED TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN. AND THEN 25 YEARS LATER, IT'S JUST LIKE IT ALL KIND OF CAME ALIVE FOR ME. AND SO I JUST REALLY FELT LIKE THIS TREMENDOUS STUFF HERE.
YOU1000000033_S0000149	IF YOU COULD JUST COMMUNICATE IT IN A CLEAR, ORDERLY, UNDERSTANDABLE WAY, PEOPLE WOULD GET SO MUCH HELP IN GROWING THEIR UNION WITH THE LORD.
YOU1000000033_S0000150	PETER'S WRITTEN BOOKS LIKE THAT, SISTER ANNE'S WRITTEN BOOKS LIKE THAT. SO PART OF THE MINISTRY IS ALSO THE WRITING, WHICH HAS HELPED AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE.
YOU1000000033_S0000152	JOHN PAUL WAS A KIND OF SHEPHERD AND GUIDE FOR US. HE WAS THE GUY WHO INTERPRETED FOR US WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH. AND IT CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT OUR SENSE WAS. SO HE CONFIRMED US IN THE MISSION.
YOU1000000033_S0000153	WE HAD GONE TO ROME. WE WERE DOING A CONFERENCE IN ROME AND THE LAST NIGHT THAT WE WERE THERE, WE GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE HOLY FATHER, JOHN PAUL, ASKING IF WE WOULD LIKE TO COME TO HIS MASS THE NEXT MORNING.
YOU1000000033_S0000154	YOU KNOW, WAS LIKE, LIKE TO, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE. SO WE WENT THERE AND AFTER MASS, WHEN HE CAME TO RALPH, WHO WAS NEXT TO ME,
YOU1000000033_S0000155	I GAVE HIM A COPY OF MY LATEST BOOK AT THE TIME CALLED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AT THE END OF THE AGE, WHAT IS THE SPIRIT SAYING? HE TOOK THE BOOK AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I READ IT ALREADY. I ALMOST FELL OVER. I ALMOST BECAME SPEECHLESS.
YOU1000000033_S0000156	THEN HE TURNED TO RALPH AND HE TOOK RALPH BY THE UPPER ARMS. HE JUST TOOK HIM AND HE KIND OF SHOOK HIM LIKE THIS. AND HE SAID, RALPH, TELL ME, WHAT IS THE SPIRIT SAYING TO THE CHURCH?
YOU1000000033_S0000158	AND I KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE 300 PAGE ANSWER, SO I SAID, HOLY FATHER, I THINK WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH IS JESUS. SO HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE SAID, JESUS, AND I SAID, JESUS.
YOU1000000033_S0000159	WE JUST STOOD THERE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES SAYING THE NAME OF JESUS AND IT WAS JUST A VERY, VERY SPECIAL MOMENT OF COMMUNION WITH THE LORD AND COMMUNION WITH THE POPE AND JUST PROCLAIMING THE NAME OF JESUS TOGETHER. IT WAS JUST VERY, VERY SPECIAL.
YOU1000000033_S0000160	JOHN PAUL II IS OUR PATRON, THE CENTRAL PATRON OF RENEWAL MINISTRIES. HE'S A GREAT INTERCESSOR FOR US. WE CONTINUE TO PRAY, WE ASK FOR HIS HELP. I FEEL HIS PRESENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M ON MISSION INTERNATIONALLY.
YOU1000000033_S0000161	IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY, WE'VE ASKED ST. JOHN PAUL II TO BE OUR PATRON. WE ALSO ASKED MARY.
YOU1000000033_S0000162	YOU KNOW, SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE NEW EVANGELIZATION. SHE'S APPEARING IN THE WORLD. SHE'S CARRYING FORTH THE MESSAGE. SHE'S SORT OF LIKE LEADING THE CHARGE IN MANY WAYS.
YOU1000000033_S0000163	AND WE PRAY, WE TRY TO STAY CLOSE, WE TRY TO LISTEN TO WHAT'S HAPPENING THROUGH THE APPARITIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED BY THE CHURCH AND WHAT'S THE MESSAGE THERE AS WELL, BECAUSE IT'S PROPHETIC.
YOU1000000033_S0000164	IT'S A PROPHETIC MESSAGE AND WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE A PROPHETIC MINISTRY IN PART. WE'RE MEANT TO REALLY DIAL IN TO TRY TO HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING TO THE CHURCH TODAY AND TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU1000000033_S0000165	WHAT DOES GOD WANT?
YOU1000000033_S0000167	FROM US WHO ARE HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS. HOW ARE WE CALLED TO LIVE IN THIS GENERATION, IN THIS TIME, AND ALL OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY BEGINNING TO FACE?
YOU1000000033_S0000168	BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, 1,700 YEARS OF CHRISTIAN CULTURE IS COLLAPSING. ALL KINDS OF SUPPORTS THAT USED TO BE THERE FOR LIVING A MORAL LIFE, OR ALL KINDS OF RESPECT THAT USED TO BE THERE FOR THE CHURCH, FOR THE SYNAGOGUE, WHATEVER, JUST ISN'T THERE ANYMORE.
YOU1000000033_S0000169	AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE LIVING IN THE GROWTH OF AN INTERNATIONAL PAGAN CULTURE THAT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH. WHERE IS THEIR LOYALTY?
YOU1000000033_S0000170	WHAT DO THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT JESUS CHRIST? ARE THEY WILLING TO SUFFER FOR HIM? ARE THEY WILLING TO SUFFER RATHER THAN TO DENY HIM? ARE THEY WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PASS ON THE FAITH TO THEIR CHILDREN?
YOU1000000033_S0000171	EVEN WHEN THE CULTURE IS PLACING TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES IN FRONT OF IT. SO WE'RE LIVING IN QUITE A TIME OF CONFLICT AND DECISION. IT'S FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS THAT WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING.
YOU1000000033_S0000172	I HOPE THAT RENEWAL MINISTRIES CAN HELP PEOPLE MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FRIENDS IN JESUS CHRIST AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOYAL TO HIM, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF TREMENDOUS OPPRESSION AND DIFFICULTIES.
YOU1000000033_S0000173	THE CULTURE IS LETHAL.
YOU1000000033_S0000175	RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT JUST KIND OF, YOU KNOW, ENTICING YOU.
YOU1000000033_S0000176	IT'S JUST TAKING PEOPLE AND TAKING THEM RIGHT OUT OF THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THEY'VE LIVED WITH THE LITTLE FAITH THAT PERHAPS THEY'VE HAD.
YOU1000000033_S0000177	AND EVEN IF THEIR FAITH IS STRONG, THE ENTICEMENTS OF THE WORLD ARE NOW SO STRONG THAT IF PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY ROOTED IN GOD, THEY CAN EASILY BE PULLED OUT WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING AT FIRST WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM.
YOU1000000033_S0000178	SO IT'S IN ALL THESE WAYS THAT I THINK RENEWAL MINISTRIES BRINGS A MESSAGE. IT BRINGS THE LOVE OF GOD. IT HELPS PEOPLE RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ASHAMED OF WHERE YOU ARE.
YOU1000000033_S0000179	JUST COME. COME AND LEARN THE LOVE THAT GOD HAS FOR YOU. COME AND LEARN THE MERCY THAT HE HAS FOR YOU. AND THEN SEE, AS YOU BECOME A DISCIPLE OF CHRIST, SEE HOW HE WANTS TO USE YOU IN A WORLD THAT'S PRETTY BROKEN.
YOU1000000033_S0000181	YOU KNOW, PETER, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT EVERY DAY, AND YOU'RE GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND DOING WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO, SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET THE WHOLE TRAJECTORY OF WHAT GOD'S DONE. IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE WHAT THE LORD'S DONE WITH US.
YOU1000000033_S0000182	YEAH, IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY.
YOU1000000033_S0000184	A NUMBER OF THINGS CAME TO MIND, THINKING ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAD A GRAND PLAN AT THE BEGINNING.
YOU1000000033_S0000185	NO.
YOU1000000033_S0000186	IT WAS THE LORD WAS GETTING OUR ATTENTION, AND HE SAID, LOOK, I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING. AND IT WAS STEP BY STEP, AND WE HAD HELP FROM OTHER PEOPLE, JUST ENCOURAGEMENT IN THE SPIRIT.
YOU1000000033_S0000187	I WAS JUST THINKING HOW POPE JOHN PAUL II USED TO SAY ST. JOHN PAUL II, AND NOW POPE FRANCIS EVEN SAYS, YOU KNOW, THAT PART OF THE SPIRIT'S MISSION IS TO REVEAL JESUS TO EVERY HUMAN HEART, BUT TO CREATE MOVEMENT.
YOU1000000033_S0000188	AND AS WE TOGETHER WERE ENCOUNTERING THE SPIRIT MORE DEEPLY, HE MOVED US, AND HE MOVED OTHER PEOPLE, AND IT WAS LIKE WE WERE CARRIED ALONG.
YOU1000000033_S0000189	YEAH.
YOU1000000033_S0000190	SO IT'S JUST REALLY GREAT.
YOU1000000033_S0000191	YEAH.
YOU1000000033_S0000192	YEAH.
YOU1000000033_S0000193	IT REALLY IS TRUE, THE HOLY SPIRIT LEADS PEOPLE. HE LED US, HE CAN LEAD ANYBODY, REALLY. IT'S JUST REALLY AMAZING, AND JUST THE WAY YOU TOLD THE STORY ABOUT HOW WE GOT LAUNCHED INTO LITHUANIA AND ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES WE WERE IN, AND HOW WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO THIS POINT.
YOU1000000033_S0000194	AND TO THIS DAY, I MEAN, LIKE EVERY WEEK WE'RE GETTING REPORTS FROM OUR COUNTRY COORDINATORS WHO ARE DOING TREMENDOUS THINGS IN SO MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU1000000033_S0000195	WE DID, YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR WE DID 41 INTERNATIONAL MISSIONS IN ABOUT 35 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND COLLABORATING WITH JUST SOME AMAZING PEOPLE, YOU KNOW? CARDINAL TURKS, AND JUST, YOU KNOW, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
YOU1000000033_S0000196	RELIGIOUS, LAITY FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD IN A PARTNERSHIP. I MEAN, AS I MENTIONED, WE DON'T GO HANG UP OUR SHINGLE AROUND THE WORLD AND GET PEOPLE TO JOIN OUR ORGANIZATION.
YOU1000000033_S0000197	THE LORD JUST HAS GIVEN US GIFTS AND EXPERIENCE AND RESOURCES TO COME ALONGSIDE THESE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AROUND THE WORLD AND PARTNER WITH THEM IN A COMMUNION AND MISSION THAT IS OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THIS GREAT MOMENT OF EVANGELIZATION, NEW EVANGELIZATION IN THE CHURCH.
YOU1000000033_S0000198	AND WE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE LORD HAD GIVEN US SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY HELP STRENGTHEN LEADERSHIP IN THE CHURCH, AND THE LORD HAS GIVEN US SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES NOW TO DO THAT.
YOU1000000033_S0000199	I JUST GOT BACK FROM DOING A WORKSHOP FOR DEACONS IN THE ARCHDIOCESE OF HARTFORD ABOUT READY TO GO TO DO A CLERGY CONVOCATION IN CALGARY.
YOU1000000033_S0000200	RECENTLY DID THE CLERGY CONVOCATION OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF DETROIT. SO WE'RE GETTING OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY STRENGTHEN PRIESTS AND DEACONS AND GIVE THEM COURAGE AND GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE, YOU KNOW, IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL.
YOU1000000033_S0000201	AND THAT'S SOMEWHAT NEW, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT OVERSEAS IN DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT I THINK HERE IN THE STATES, I MEAN, YOU'VE DONE IT MORE THAN THE REST OF US, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE DOORS ARE KIND OF THROWN WIDE OPEN BECAUSE THEY'RE RECOGNIZING THE SAME THINGS.
YOU1000000033_S0000202	YOU GUYS DO HAVE SOMETHING, GOD'S GIVEN YOU SOMETHING, WE WANT TO LISTEN TO IT. WHY DON'T YOU COME AND HELP US OUT BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED IT.
YOU1000000033_S0000203	I THINK THE CHURCH IS WAKING UP TO THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK WE NEED GOD. I THINK WE NEED POWERFUL ON HIGH. I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING MORE.
YOU1000000033_S0000204	BECAUSE THE TSUNAMI OF SECULARISM IS JUST ENGULFING PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND THE STATISTICS ARE JUST GETTING MORE AND MORE GRIM, AND THE DECLINE OF THINGS.
YOU1000000033_S0000205	AND WE'RE TRYING TO TELL BISHOPS AND PRIESTS AND DEACONS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST KIND OF PRESIDE OVER DECLINE AND DOWNSIZING. YOU WANT TO GENERATE A NEW ENERGY OF EVANGELIZATION AND PENTECOST THAT CAN REALLY TURN THE TIDE.
YOU1000000033_S0000206	AND LIVE THE NEW PENTECOST.
YOU1000000033_S0000207	AMEN, AMEN, A CULTURE OF PENTECOST. WELL, PETER, WE HAVE SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR, AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IS THIS BOOKLET YOU'VE WRITTEN, WHICH IS CALLED LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.
YOU1000000033_S0000208	JESUS IS THE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS, AND WE WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS BOOKLET AT NO COST, JUST FOR THE ASKING, AND WE'LL BE BACK.
YOU1000000033_S0000210	FRIENDS, WE'RE LIVING THROUGH DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TIMES. THE CHURCH IS IN A FIERCE BATTLE.
YOU1000000033_S0000211	IN THE WORDS OF POPE EMERITUS BENEDICT XVI, MAN IS PUSHING GOD FROM THE HUMAN HORIZON, AND AS A RESULT, THE LIGHT WHICH COMES FROM GOD IS DISAPPEARING, AND HUMANITY IS LOSING ITS BEARINGS.
YOU1000000033_S0000212	IN THIS MOMENT, IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE HEAR THE WORDS OF JESUS WHO SAID, I'M THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. HE WHO FOLLOWS ME WILL NOT WALK IN DARKNESS, BUT WILL HAVE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.
YOU1000000033_S0000213	I WROTE THIS SHORT BOOKLET TO HELP YOU LAY HOLD OF THIS PRECIOUS PROMISE FROM JESUS SO YOU CAN HAVE THE STRENGTH AND THE COURAGE YOU NEED TO BE A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.
YOU1000000033_S0000214	TO ORDER YOUR FREE COPY OF LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS, YOU CAN GO TO RENEWALMINISTRIES.NET OR CALL 1 800 282 4789.
YOU1000000033_S0000216	PETER, WE'VE SEEN HOW THE LORD HAS WORKED WITH US, BUT THE LORD WANTS TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?
YOU1000000033_S0000217	RIGHT.
YOU1000000033_S0000218	SO I'D JUST LIKE TO TELL YOU FOLKS THAT OPEN YOURSELF TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. ASK GOD TO GIVE YOU THE POWER AND STRENGTH YOU NEED FOR YOUR MISSION OF BEING A WITNESS FOR HIM IN WHERE YOU ARE.
YOU1000000033_S0000219	NEXT WEEK, SAME TIME, SAME PLACE, THE CHOICES WE FACE.

YOU1000000037_S0000253	I THINK THIS FISH ART IS REALLY CATCHING ON BECAUSE WE FISH KEEPERS CAN APPRECIATE IT AND IT'S A WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION TO FISH TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE AN AQUARIUM. THEY CAN HAVE A PAINTING OF A FISH.
YOU1000000037_S0000255	AND I THINK IF WE CAN CONNECT THE TWO, FISH ART TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE AQUARIUMS, TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE FISH ART AND AQUARIUMS, WE CAN TEACH THEM HOW TO KEEP AN AQUARIUM AT LEAST EFFICIENTLY, IF NOT EASILY.
YOU1000000037_S0000256	I THINK THEY REALLY, THEY'VE HEIGHTENED THE ENJOYMENT I HAVE IN MY LIFE. I THINK THEY WILL OTHER PEOPLE TOO AND IT'S A GOOD MISSION THAT WE'RE ON TO SHARE OUR HOBBY WITH PEOPLE.

YOU1000000037_S0000318	BUT I GOT THEM FROM THE LOCAL FISH STORE WHO SOLD THEM AS SHRIMP ASSORTED.
YOU1000000037_S0000320	SO I PURCHASED THREE BLUE SHRIMP ASSORTED AND PUT IN THAT 1.5 GALLON.
YOU1000000037_S0000322	DID A VIDEO. LOVE THE VIDEO. THOSE SHRIMP ARE SUCH CUTE LITTLE RASCALS.
YOU1000000037_S0000324	THINK IF YOU'LL CHECK THAT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT THE THINGS GOT VIDEO SINCE TUESDAY HAS 194 VIEWS AS AT THE TIME WE WENT ON AIR 48 LIKES SO
YOU1000000037_S0000326	IT'S A LITTLE SLOW OUT OF THE GATE AFTER IT LAUNCHED WELL, THEN IT KIND OF SLOWED DOWN OUT OF THE GATE. SO IT'S GOOD VIDEO. I HOPE YOU GUYS WATCH IT. LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.
YOU1000000037_S0000328	AND NOW IT IS 11 O'CLOCK. LET'S GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK, BOTTOM OF THE WATER COLUMN. AND THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE CHANGES IN THE RIVER LIFE FISH STUDIO.
YOU1000000037_S0000329	AND IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG WITH US HERE IN THE COMMUNITY TANK, YOU KNOW THE FISH STUDIO IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, BUT WE'RE GOING VERY SLOW NOW WAITING ON SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE HOUSE. SO THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN IT HAPPENS.
YOU1000000037_S0000330	WE'VE GOT IT ON A PRIORITY LIST. WE'RE GETTING CLOSER EVERY DAY, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE MINOR CHANGES UNTIL THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES ARRIVE. AND AT THAT TIME, WE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FISH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER COLUMN.
YOU1000000037_S0000332	SO HERE'S A VIDEO I MADE TODAY.
YOU1000000037_S0000334	I THINK THAT'S STRIKING GOLDFISH, BUT THIS VENDOR ALSO HAD SOME BOTTOM DWELLERS. LOOK AT ALL THE BANDED HIGH FIN SHARKS. LOOK AT ALL THOSE LITTLE GUYS.
YOU1000000037_S0000336	WE HAD A COUPLE HUNDRED OF THOSE AND I THINK THOSE ARE OUTSTANDING BOTTOM DWELLING ASIAN FISH. THEY GET UP TO THREE FEET LONG
YOU1000000037_S0000338	30 36 INCHES
YOU1000000037_S0000339	AND THE VENDOR TOLD ME THEY COULD WITHSTAND TEMPERATURES DOWN TO NEGATIVE 22 FAHRENHEIT. 22 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. AMAZING.
YOU1000000037_S0000341	SO, I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF THOSE IN MY LIFE. I'VE ACTUALLY ORDERED
YOU1000000037_S0000343	SHARKS BEFORE BUT HIGH FIN BANDED SHARKS, BUT THEY DIDN'T ARRIVE I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF ISSUES WITH GETTING THEM SO I'M STILL WITHOUT AND HERE I AM AT THE SHOW AND THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF
YOU1000000037_S0000345	SO I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE OR TWO OF THOSE IN MY LIFE.
YOU1000000037_S0000347	GARAMI AND PARADISE FISH
YOU1000000037_S0000349	HUH.
YOU1000000037_S0000351	NEITHER OF WHICH I ASSOCIATED PREVIOUSLY AS BEING ASIAN. I'M GONNA LOOK AT THAT.
YOU1000000037_S0000353	THAT'S FUNNY. ALL THOSE BEAUTIES IN THE BATHROOM. HOW DOES SHE DO IT?
YOU1000000037_S0000355	WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIMPLY BED AS FISH SHRIMP BEING IN A BATHROOM.
YOU1000000037_S0000357	AND SIMPLY BETTER SAYS JUST GO VERTICAL VERTICAL BABY. IT'S NOT DIFFICULT
YOU1000000037_S0000359	ALIEN WORLD AQUATICS IS IN THE HOUSE AND BEFORE I FORGET AGAIN ALIEN WORLD. LET ME SAY
YOU1000000037_S0000361	AND IF YOU NEED TO REWIND THIS AND WATCH IT ON REPLAY.
YOU1000000037_S0000362	THE DARK FROGS I RECOMMEND FOR YOU ARE THE LARGER TERRESTRIAL DARK FROGS, THE GREEN AND BLACK DARK FROG,
YOU1000000037_S0000363	IT'S SCIENTIFIC NAME
YOU1000000037_S0000365	IT ENDS IN ERRATUS.
YOU1000000037_S0000367	FORMERLY WAS DENDROBATES. DO THEY STILL USE DENDROBATES? THEY'VE CHANGED SO MANY OF THE GENUS. DENDROBATES ERRATUS AND THE TINCTORIUS. DENDROBATES TINCTORIUS.
YOU1000000037_S0000368	THOSE ARE DIURNAL, THEY'RE AWAKE DURING THE DAY, THEIR CALL IS A VERY SOFT BUZZ. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR EAR TO THE TANK IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE MALE'S CALL. AND THEN THIRDLY, THE LEUCAMELLA.
YOU1000000037_S0000369	THE DENDROBATES LEUCOMELLA, THAT'S THE BUMBLEBEE OR YELLOW AND BLACK POISON DART FROG AND IT HAS A VERY AUDIBLE CALL. IT'S A LOUD TRILL THAT REMINDS YOU OF THE JUNGLE. SO IT'S PRETTY COOL.
YOU1000000037_S0000370	BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AN ON OFF SWITCH, OKAY? SO IF YOU LOVE IT, THAT'S THE ONE TO GO WITH BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THAT JUNGLE TRAIL IN YOUR HOUSE DURING THE DAY IT WON'T BOTHER YOU AT NIGHT
YOU1000000037_S0000371	BUT DURING THE DAY YOU MAY WANT TO STEER CLEAR OF THE LEUCOMELA.
YOU1000000037_S0000373	THOSE ARE ALL LARGER, BEAUTIFUL, AND THE TINCTORIS I MENTIONED, IT'S LIKE BLUE AND BRIGHT YELLOW AND VARIANTS OF BOTH. YELLOW BACK, BLUE LEGS. LOOK THEM UP ONLINE. THERE'S MILLIONS OF
YOU1000000037_S0000375	PHOTOGRAPHS AND OF COURSE ON YOUTUBE THERE'S LOTS OF VIDEOS. THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU. STAY AWAY FROM THE SMALLER THUMBNAIL SIZE FROGS. THEY'RE MORE ARBOREAL, MORE TEMPERAMENTAL, MORE DEMANDING AS FAR AS ENVIRONMENT GOES.
YOU1000000037_S0000376	AND THE DEALER THAT I HAVE, I DON'T KNOW MANY, I'M OUT OF THE LOOP, BUT ONE THAT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN IS JOSH'S FROGS.
YOU1000000037_S0000377	AND HE HAD NO IDEA I WAS GONNA SAY THAT THIS IS NOT AN ADVERTISEMENT. IT'S NOT SPONSORED JUST
YOU1000000037_S0000379	I RECOGNIZE SOME GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE PRACTICES THERE AND HEALTHY FROGS AND GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. SO A TERRESTRIAL FROG, ONE OF THE THREE I MENTIONED I THINK ARE ALL GREAT BEGINNER FROGS AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE.
YOU1000000037_S0000380	I ACTUALLY DID WELL WITH THE AZUREUS, WHICH NOW IS A SUBSPECIES OF THE TINCTORIUS. IT'S JUST SOLID BLUE WITH BLACK SPOTS. PRETTY AMAZING.
YOU1000000037_S0000381	BUT ANYWAY, I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE. THANKS FOR... HEY, DANKTANKS! YAY!
YOU1000000037_S0000382	DANKTANKS IS HERE, POISON DART FROG GUY, WELCOME DANK. AND HE SAYS YES, BOTH TENDER BABIES. SO HE'S STILL THE MAN IN THE HOBBY. THERE YOU GO. YOU HOOK UP ALIEN WORLD, HOOK UP WITH DANKTANKS. SEE WHAT HE'S GOT GOING ON.
YOU1000000037_S0000384	HE MAY EVEN BE BREEDING BY NOW. DANKTANKS, DO YOU HAVE ANY FROGLETS?

YOU1000000037_S0000672	UNTIL THE NEXT TIME, WHY DON'T YOU GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT, LOVE IT, AND LIVE IT. I'LL SEE YOU ON THE NEXT ONE.
YOU1000000039_S0000001	THIS WEEK WE TAKE TO THE TURKEY WOODS. IT WAS YOUTH SEASON IN MISSOURI AND ARKANSAS AND THE GROWINGDEER TEAM JUMPS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A KID HUNTING. TAKING A YOUNG HUNTER CAN PRESENT SOME CHALLENGES.
YOU1000000039_S0000002	BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE TO CREATION THROUGH A HUNTING EXPERIENCE, WELL, THAT'S PRICELESS.
YOU1000000039_S0000003	20 POUNDS, ONE OUNCE. THAT'S A GOOD BIRD, BABY.
YOU1000000039_S0000005	GROWINGDEER IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY BASS PRO SHOPS, RECONYX, TROPHY ROCK, EAGLE SEED, NIKON, WINCHESTER, DEAD DOWN WIND, ANTLER DIRT, LACROSSE FOOTWEAR, BLOODSPORT ARROWS,
YOU1000000039_S0000006	FLATWOOD NATIVES, MORRELL TARGETS, CALDWELL, HOOK'S CUSTOM CALLS, MONTANA DECOY, SUMMIT TREESTANDS, DRAKE NON TYPICAL CLOTHING, HOWES LUBRICATOR, RTP OUTDOORS,
YOU1000000039_S0000007	LEM GAME PROCESSING, FOURTH ARROW, G5 BROADHEADS, PRIME BOWS, AND REDNECK HUNTING BLINDS.
YOU1000000039_S0000009	MISSOURI'S YOUTH SEASON IS TWO DAYS LONG AND ALWAYS A WEEK BEFORE THE REGULAR SEASON OPENS. ANYONE 15 OR YOUNGER IS CLASSIFIED AS A YOUTH HUNTER, RAE IS 14, SO ADAM, RAE AND I WERE EAGER TO HEAD OUT SATURDAY MORNING.
YOU1000000039_S0000011	WE'VE BEEN USING RECONYX CAMERAS TO SCOUT THE PROVING GROUNDS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHICH RIDGE TOPS AND FOOD PLOTS TURKEYS WERE USING AS THREAT ZONES.
YOU1000000039_S0000012	BASED ON STUDYING THE RECONYX PICTURES AND VIDEOS, THERE'S ONE CLOVER FIELD ON TOP OF A RIDGE WE CALL BOOMERANG THAT SEEMED TO HAVE THE MOST ACTIVITY.
YOU1000000039_S0000014	MISSOURI'S EWE SEASON USUALLY CORRESPONDS WITH THE VERY EARLY PART OF THE TURKEY BREEDING SEASON. AND AT THIS TIME, THE HENS ARE STILL IN FLOCKS AND THE GOBBLERS AREN'T FAR BEHIND.
YOU1000000039_S0000015	THE HENS ARE PRETTY MUCH ON A GET OFF THE ROOST AND FEEDING PATTERN DAILY. THEY'RE NOT ALL SPREAD OUT SEEKING NESTING HABITAT AND IT'S A GREAT TIME TO PATTERN TURKEYS.
YOU1000000039_S0000016	ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE YOUTH SEASON OPENED, WE MOVED A REDNECK HAY BALE BLIND AT THE EDGE OF THE POWER LINE OVERLOOKING THE CLOVER FOOD PLOT.
YOU1000000039_S0000018	WE SET OUT AT MISS PERFECT DECOY AND SETTLED IN THE BLIND WAY BEFORE DAYLIGHT. AND IT WAS A REALLY ENJOYABLE TIME WATCHING AND LISTENING TO ALL THE CRITTERS COME TO LIFE AS THE SUN PEEKED OVER THE HORIZON.
YOU1000000039_S0000020	THE THREE OF US WERE LISTENING TO SEVERAL TOMS GOBBLING IN THE DISTANCE, BUT AFTER A WHILE, THREE BIRDS FIRED UP WHAT WE ASSUMED TO BE ABOUT 200 YARDS IN FRONT OF US AND WE KNEW THOSE WERE THE TOMS WE WERE AFTER.
YOU1000000039_S0000022	IT'S ALWAYS FUN LISTENING TO GOBBLERS WHEN YOU KNOW THE TERRAIN AND TRYING TO IMAGINE WHERE THEY ARE. AND AS THESE GOBBLERS STARTED CLOSING THE DISTANCE, ADAM AND I BOTH AGREED THEY WERE REALLY CLOSE TO A REDNECK BLIND.
YOU1000000039_S0000023	THAT WAS ABOUT 150 YARDS IN FRONT OF US, JUST OVER THE HILL AND THROUGH SOME TIMBER.
YOU1000000039_S0000025	I COULDN'T REALLY TELL IF THEY WERE MOVING TOWARD US OR KIND OF JUST GOING BACK AND FORTH ON THE RIDGE. ADAM HIT THE CALL ONE MORE TIME AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THOSE TOMS HAD COMMITTED AND WERE COMING OUR WAY.
YOU1000000039_S0000027	LISTENING TO THEM GOBBLE, WE THOUGHT THEY WERE RIGHT ON THE RIDGE TOP. AND IT WASN'T LONG UNTIL WE SAW THOSE WHITE HEADS COMING DOWN THE LOGGING ROAD.
YOU1000000039_S0000028	I SEE IT.
YOU1000000039_S0000030	THREE.
YOU1000000039_S0000032	CAN I SHOOT ONE?
YOU1000000039_S0000034	I WOULD BE SHOOTING THE GOPRO.
YOU1000000039_S0000036	HE'S TOO CLOSE.
YOU1000000039_S0000038	OKAY.
YOU1000000039_S0000040	YOU NAILED IT, RAY.
YOU1000000039_S0000042	LOOK AT HIM, WATCH HIM.
YOU1000000039_S0000044	THAT'S A BIG ONE, RIGHT?
YOU1000000039_S0000046	I DID IT, FLINCH.
YOU1000000039_S0000047	NO, YOU WERE PERFECT. YOU NAILED HIM.
YOU1000000039_S0000049	GOOD HOOKS, RIGHT?
YOU1000000039_S0000050	YEP.
YOU1000000039_S0000052	GOOD FIRST, LOOK AT THOSE.
YOU1000000039_S0000053	HMM.
YOU1000000039_S0000054	THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE LONGER. THEY'RE BOTH GOOD. PROBABLY A THREE YEAR OLD BIRD.
YOU1000000039_S0000055	HMM.
YOU1000000039_S0000057	AND OH MAN, LOOK AT THAT.
YOU1000000039_S0000058	MM, IT'S REALLY LONG.
YOU1000000039_S0000060	WHAT ARE BEAUTIFUL FEATHERS, AREN'T THEY?
YOU1000000039_S0000061	YEAH, THEY LOOK KIND OF BLUISH.
YOU1000000039_S0000062	YEP.
YOU1000000039_S0000064	WELL, HE PEPPERED HIS HEAD.
YOU1000000039_S0000066	HE DIDN'T FLOP AROUND MUCH, DID HE?
YOU1000000039_S0000067	NOPE.
YOU1000000039_S0000069	WELL.
YOU1000000039_S0000071	GET HIM OUT HERE WHERE WE CAN TAKE SOME PICTURES AND GO BACK AND TAKE HIM TO THE HOUSE.
YOU1000000039_S0000072	DEFINITELY.
YOU1000000039_S0000073	GRANT, RAY MADE A GREAT SHOT AND THAT TOM BARELY FLOPPED. WE GOT OUT, INSPECTED THE TURKEY, SHARED SOME HUGS AND TALKED ABOUT THE HUNT. AFTER WE KIND OF SETTLED DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND WE'VE TAKEN A FEW PICTURES, WE
YOU1000000039_S0000074	I STEPPED OFF FROM THE TURKEY, BACK TO THE HAY BALE BLIND AND IT WAS 48 STEPS – 48 YARDS. I GOTTA TELL YOU, BEFORE WE STARTED USING WINCHESTER LONE BEARD XR, I WOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN HER THE OKAY TO TAKE THAT SHOT.
YOU1000000039_S0000075	BUT THROUGH PATTERNING AND EXPERIENCE, I WAS FULLY CONFIDENT SHE'D TAKE THAT TOM DOWN.
YOU1000000039_S0000077	BASED ON THE SPUR LENGTH, ABOUT AN INCH AND 316THS, THE TOM'S PROBABLY THREE YEARS OLD. THAT'S A GOOD TOM ANYWHERE, BUT IT WAS AN EVEN BETTER HUNT. BIRDS GOBBLED GOOD, RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT AS THEY WERE APPROACHING.
YOU1000000039_S0000078	BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT WAS JUST A FUN HUNT TO SHARE WITH MY DAUGHTER, RAE.
YOU1000000039_S0000080	AFTER EVERY SUCCESSFUL HUNT, I LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME AND SEE WHAT THE CRITTER HAS BEEN EATING. I CALL THIS SCOUTING FROM THE SKINNING SHED.
YOU1000000039_S0000082	23 AND A HALF. 23 AND A HALF. GOOD TOM FOR THE OZARKS. AND IT'S AN EASY TEN. A LITTLE BIT OVER TEN INCHES ON THE BEARD.
YOU1000000039_S0000083	GRANT, SHARING THE HUNT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND JUST AS IMPORTANT IS PROPERLY PREPARING THE MEAT. WE ALL SHOULD BE THANKFUL WHEN WE HARVEST GAME AND THAT NATURAL SOURCE OF MEAT TO FEED OUR FAMILIES. FIRST THING TO DO, OF COURSE, IS REMOVE THE BEARD.
YOU1000000039_S0000085	SO I JUST PUT MY HAND AT THE BASE AND GIVE IT A GOOD TUG.
YOU1000000039_S0000087	THERE IT IS. NICE, FULL BEARD. TURNED THE TURKEY UP RIGHT WHERE HIS BREAST BONE IS TO ME AND I JUST WANTED TO OPEN UP AND SEE WHAT'S IN HIS CROP. PROBABLY NOT MUCH BECAUSE WE CALLED THIS TURKEY RIGHT OFF THE ROOST. WE COULD HEAR HIM IN THE TREE, HEAR HIM HIT THE GROUND.
YOU1000000039_S0000088	DIFFERENT CALL SOUND OR DIFFERENT VOLUME ANYWAY, SO I DOUBT HE'S FED MUCH, BUT WE'LL SEE.
YOU1000000039_S0000090	AND I WANT TO CUT OUT AWAY FROM THE FEATHERS. IF YOU CUT IN, YOU'RE GONNA GET FEATHERS ALL OVER THE MEAT.
YOU1000000039_S0000092	AND YOU CAN TELL WE'RE STILL VERY EARLY IN THE BREEDING SEASON. LOOK AT ALL THIS FAT. IN A WEEK OR TWO, IF WE HARVEST A TOM, I PREDICT IT WON'T HAVE NEAR AS MUCH FAT AS NOW.
YOU1000000039_S0000093	AND YOU ALSO NOTICE, STILL FULL OF BREAST FEATHERS, MEANS THEY'RE NOT BREEDING MUCH YET. THEY HAVEN'T WORN THOSE BREAST FEATHERS OFF. SO, IT KIND OF GIVES YOU A GOOD GAUGE OF WHERE THE LOCAL TURKEY POPULATION IS IN THE BREEDING CYCLE.
YOU1000000039_S0000095	THIS TURKEY, OF COURSE, CAME OFF THE ROOST AND IT'S SO EMPTY, I'M FEELING RIGHT HERE, AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HIS CROP. WHEN I OPENED UP THE CROP AND THE TOM RAY HARVESTED, THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT.
YOU1000000039_S0000096	APPARENTLY, THAT OLD TOM CAME OFF THE ROOST AND STARTED WORKING RIGHT TOWARD OUR SETUP.
YOU1000000039_S0000098	USUALLY, WHEN YOU OPEN UP A DEER'S STOMACH OR A TURKEY'S CROP, THERE'S GREAT INFORMATION THAT TELLS US WHERE TURKEYS ARE SPENDING TIME EATING. BUT WHEN YOU SHOOT A TOM THAT CAME TO YOU RIGHT OFF THE ROOST, OFTENTIMES, THERE WILL BE NOTHING IN HIS CROP.
YOU1000000039_S0000100	PRO STAFFERS HEATH AND LINDSEY MARTIN ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A YOUTH HUNTING THIS PAST WEEKEND. THEY WENT ON A YOUTH HUNT SET UP BY SCOTT HOOK OF HOOK'S CUSTOM CALLS. THE HUNT WAS ORGANIZED IN NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS.
YOU1000000039_S0000103	ONCE THEY ARRIVED IN CAMP, THEY MET UP WITH SCOTT AND THEIR YOUTH HUNTER, GRACIE PATE. GRACIE'S 13 AND HAS TAGGED A FEW DEER, BUT NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TAG A TURKEY.
YOU1000000039_S0000104	SO WHO ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT FOR THE WEEKEND?
YOU1000000039_S0000105	UM, PROBABLY TOMORROW MORNING JUST GETTING OUT THERE AND BEING ABLE TO HEAR THEM AND HOPEFULLY GETTING A TURKEY.
YOU1000000039_S0000106	HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CHANCE TO HEAR VERY MANY TURKEYS?
YOU1000000039_S0000107	UM... WHAT?
YOU1000000039_S0000108	WHAT?
YOU1000000039_S0000109	WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANY PRESSURE TO MR. MARTIN ABOUT GETTING YOU A BIRD TOMORROW? DO YOU KNOW HE FEELS A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET YOU A BIRD?
YOU1000000039_S0000110	I'M FEELING A LOT OF PRESSURE TO SHOOT THE BIRD.
YOU1000000039_S0000112	AFTER INTRODUCTIONS AND GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER, THEY HEADED OVER TO THE FARM WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO HUNT AND DID A LITTLE SCOUTING.
YOU1000000039_S0000114	THE NEXT MORNING WAS OPENING DAY, BUT DURING THE NIGHT, A STRONG COLD FRONT CAME IN AND BRINGING WITH IT VERY HIGH WINDS. IT APPARENTLY GAVE ALL THE TURKEYS LOCKJAW.
YOU1000000039_S0000116	AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF WALKING AROUND AND CALLING, THEY CAN'T HEAR ANY TURKEYS RESPOND DUE TO THE HIGH WIND. SO, HEATH DECIDES THEY NEED TO FIND A HIGH SPOT THAT'S OUT OF THE WIND AND SEE IF THEY CAN HEAR A TURKEY RESPOND.
YOU1000000039_S0000118	AFTER 45 MINUTES, I HAD A TURKEY RESPOND. AND NOW THEY'RE HURRYING TO GET SET UP.
YOU1000000039_S0000120	EVEN THOUGH THIS TOM GOBBLED IT, EVERY CALL HE THREW AT HIM, HE WOULDN'T CLOSE THE DISTANCE.
YOU1000000039_S0000121	WE WERE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT OUR BORDER COLLIES AND LABS AND MR. HEATH DECIDED TO CALL A LITTLE BIT AND WE HAD A LONELY GOBBLER GOBBLE BACK AT US. AND WE GOT SET UP AND GOT OUR DECOYS OUT.
YOU1000000039_S0000123	AND ABOUT THAT TIME WE JUST COULDN'T GET HIM TO COME IN.
YOU1000000039_S0000125	SO NOW WHAT'S THE PLAN?
YOU1000000039_S0000127	WELL I GOT A RODEO THIS EVENING SO WE GOT TO LEAVE A LITTLE EARLY AND GO TO THE RODEO AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET OUT HERE IN THE MORNING.
YOU1000000039_S0000129	THAT TOM WOULDN'T COMMIT TO COME TO THE CALLS AND GRACIE HAD PRIOR OBLIGATIONS THAT AFTERNOON. SO, HEATH TOOK GRACIE BACK TO CAMP AND MET UP WITH SCOTT HOOK AND SPENT THE AFTERNOON HUNTING WITH SCOTT AND HIS YOUTH HUNTER, CADE.
YOU1000000039_S0000130	I'M HERE WITH MY YOUNG HUNTER, CADE COOK, AND HIS GRANDFATHER, MITCHELL. SOME FRIENDS TOLD US OF AN AREA THAT BIRDS LIKE TO HANG OUT MIDDAY. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SLIP IN THERE AND SET UP, AND JUST SIT AROUND AND LISTEN, AND CALL A LITTLE BIT, AND MAYBE WE CAN GET HIM A SHOT.
YOU1000000039_S0000131	A FEW MINUTES INTO THE PROPERTY, THEY HAD A COOL INTERACTION WITH A HEN. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS HEN WAS VERY CHATTY, NO GOBBLER RESPONDED.
YOU1000000039_S0000133	THEY ENDED UP MOVING FURTHER IN THE PROPERTY AND HAVING A GOBBLER RESPOND TO THEIR CALLS. THEY SCRAMBLED TO GET SET UP, BUT THIS TOM WORKED HIS WAY IN SILENTLY AND WOULDN'T GIVE CADE A GOOD SHOT.
YOU1000000039_S0000135	IT WAS A FUN DAY WITH SOME GOOD INTERACTIONS, BUT NEITHER GRACIE OR CADE TAGGED A TURKEY. BUT THEY WERE READY TO GO THE NEXT MORNING.
YOU1000000039_S0000137	MULTIPLE BIRDS WERE ROOSTED THAT EVENING, SO A SECOND YOUTH HUNTER JOINED GRACIE THE NEXT MORNING.
YOU1000000039_S0000139	PEACE GROUP SET UP CLOSE TO THE ROOST SITE AND ONE OF THE BIRDS RESPONDED BUT SIMPLY DIDN'T PRESENT A GOOD SHOT DUE TO ALL THE BRUSH IN THE AREA.
YOU1000000039_S0000141	THE WIND HAS STARTED TO LAY A LITTLE BIT, BUT WE'RE STILL AT IT. WE'RE ABOUT IN A TURN WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET ONE.
YOU1000000039_S0000143	AFTER THAT FIRST SETUP, THE GROUP WAS WORKING HARD TO GET GRACIE ON A TOM BEFORE HER DEADLINE TO LEAVE FOR CHURCH.
YOU1000000039_S0000145	THEY GOT ON ANOTHER TOM AND GOT THEIR DECOYS SET UP. AND WITH A LITTLE CALLING, IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT TOM IS CLOSING THE DISTANCE.
YOU1000000039_S0000147	BIRD DOWN. CONGRATULATIONS, GRACIE, ON YOUR FIRST TURKEY.
YOU1000000039_S0000148	GOOD JOB! HOW EXCITING WAS THAT?
YOU1000000039_S0000149	THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.
YOU1000000039_S0000151	I COULD JUST HEAR SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT, SO I JUST TRIED TO GET A SHOT OFF.
YOU1000000039_S0000153	SHOOT! SHOOT! SHOOT!
YOU1000000039_S0000154	I BET THEY WERE
YOU1000000039_S0000155	THAT'S ALL I CAN HEAR!
YOU1000000039_S0000156	THERE WAS A CHANT IN THE FOREST. I BET PEOPLE ON THE ROAD CAN HEAR IT. EVERYBODY, SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT!
YOU1000000039_S0000158	HIGH FIVE.
YOU1000000039_S0000160	THANK YOU FOR CALLING MY VOTE IN FOR ME.
YOU1000000039_S0000162	THANK YOU. I TRULY APPRECIATE Y'ALL.
YOU1000000039_S0000164	OH YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
YOU1000000039_S0000166	THERE'S ONE ON THE BACK OF IT.
YOU1000000039_S0000168	AFTER ALL THE CELEBRATION, SCOTT DOES A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO INTRODUCE YOUTH TO HUNTING.
YOU1000000039_S0000169	IT REQUIRES PATIENCE, IT REQUIRES A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING, KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR ADVERSARY IN THE WOODS. IF YOU GET DOWN TO THE MOST BASIC THINGS OF TURKEY HUNTING, IT CAN REALLY TEACH YOU SOME LESSONS IN LIFE.
YOU1000000039_S0000170	AND I'M STILL TRYING TO LEARN THE PATIENT'S THING. THAT STILL HASN'T STUCK WITH ME.
YOU1000000039_S0000172	WE HAVE MANAGED TO GET A BIRD TO SORT OF...
YOU1000000039_S0000174	THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTIONS INVOLVED IN TAKING ANYONE HUNTING – YOUTH OR ADULT, NEW OR EXPERIENCED HUNTER. THERE'S ENJOYING CREATION. THERE'S THE POTENTIAL AND FOLLOW THROUGH OF TAKING THE LIFE OF ANOTHER CRITTER.
YOU1000000039_S0000175	AND THERE'S A JOY IN PROVIDING QUALITY FOOD FOR YOUR FAMILY. I CAN'T THINK OF ANY BETTER TOOL THAN HUNTING FOR TEACHING LIFE'S LESSONS.
YOU1000000039_S0000176	THANKS TO HEATH, LINDSEY AND SCOTT FOR VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME TO INTRODUCE SEVERAL YOUTH TO HUNTING THIS PAST WEEKEND IN ARKANSAS.
YOU1000000039_S0000178	DURING THE SAME WEEKEND, MATT TAGGED ALONG WITH SETH HARKER AND HIS SON, TRACE, DURING MISSOURI'S YOUTH SEASON.
YOU1000000039_S0000180	TRACE WAS EXCITED AS LAST SEASON HE TOOK HIS FIRST GOBBLER.
YOU1000000039_S0000182	DUDE, THAT'S A GOOD SHOT, BUDDY.
YOU1000000039_S0000184	THIS YEAR, TRACE WAS SET ON TAKING A LONG BEARD AND SETH AND MATT WERE MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP HIM MEET THAT GOAL.
YOU1000000039_S0000186	THE MORNING STARTED OUT GREAT AS THE GUYS GOT SOME TURKEYS FIRED UP OFF THE ROOST.
YOU1000000039_S0000188	SURE ENOUGH, TWO LONG BEARDS ENTERED THE PLOT STRUTTING, SPITTING, DRUMMING AND GOBBLING. THEY PUT ON QUITE A SHOW.
YOU1000000039_S0000189	YEAH IT'S AWESOME RIGHT DO NOT MOVE A LOT UNTIL I GET IN FRONT OF YOUR GUN BARREL
YOU1000000039_S0000191	ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF TAKING A YOUTH HUNTING IS GETTING THEM SET UP RIGHT AND PREDICTING WHERE THE TURKEY IS GOING TO APPROACH.
YOU1000000039_S0000193	WHY DIDN'T I JUST POINT THE GUN DOWN THE LOGGING ROAD? WHEN WE GOT HERE AND I SEEN HIM COMING UP THE ROAD I WAS LIKE
YOU1000000039_S0000195	WHY AM I SET UP LIKE THIS?
YOU1000000039_S0000197	DID YOU EVER THINK IT?
YOU1000000039_S0000199	NOT UNTIL THEY GOT RIGHT THERE AND LIKE OKAY, I'M GOOD AND THEN WHEN IT MOVES LIKE, YO!
YOU1000000039_S0000201	I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST GONNA COME OUT, SEE THE DECOYS AND JUST STRUT RIGHT TO THEM.
YOU1000000039_S0000202	HE WAS NOT READY TO SHAKE OFF.
YOU1000000039_S0000203	I WAS, I GOT, BECAUSE...
YOU1000000039_S0000205	HE'S IN THE FRAME AND I CAN SEE THE GUN GOING.
YOU1000000039_S0000207	THIS HUNT WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF NOT HAVING A YOUTH HUNTER POINTED THE RIGHT DIRECTION DUE TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF TURKEYS. EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WITH THE TAG TURKEY, IT WAS A GREAT START TO THEIR HUNT.
YOU1000000039_S0000209	YEP.
YOU1000000039_S0000211	TURKEYS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD.
YOU1000000039_S0000213	ONE REASON WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME GREAT TURKEY HUNTS HERE AT THE PROVING GROUNDS IS OUR INTENSITY PREDATOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.
YOU1000000039_S0000215	WE'VE WORKED FOR YEARS TO BALANCE THE PREDATOR AND PREY POPULATIONS. WE USE TRAPPING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PREDATORS AND THE RESULTS OF THAT HAVE BEEN VERY HIGH SURVIVAL RATES OF TURKEY POULTS AND FAWNS.
YOU1000000039_S0000217	BUT THERE'S ANOTHER BENEFIT TO TRAPPING AND THAT'S ACQUIRING THE BEAUTIFUL PELTS. I SAVED UP SOME PELTS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND HAD MISS TRACY A BEAUTIFUL RACCOON BLANKET MADE WITH THE COYOTE TRIM.
YOU1000000039_S0000218	I LOVE THE TURKEY HUNT, SO EVERY YEAR WE CATCH SEVERAL RACCOONS HERE AT THE PROVING GROUNDS. AND PEOPLE OFTEN ASK, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL THOSE PELTS? WELL, RACCOON PELTS MAKE A BEAUTIFUL GIFT AND THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO.
YOU1000000039_S0000219	BUT THIS YEAR I WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND. I TOOK SEVERAL OF THE PALE UPS THAT WERE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE THAT I'D CAUGHT IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND I HAD MISS TRACY, A BEAUTIFUL
YOU1000000039_S0000221	LARGE RACCOON BLANKET MADE.
YOU1000000039_S0000223	AND HOW ABOUT THOSE PESKY COYOTES WE CATCH? HAD A COYOTE BUFFER PUT ON THE OUTSIDE.
YOU1000000039_S0000225	BLANKETS MADE OUT OF PELTS KEPT NATIVE AMERICANS WARM FOR CENTURIES. THIS ONE, AT LEAST BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN IN MUSEUMS, IS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE REFINED.
YOU1000000039_S0000227	THE PROCESS WAS REALLY SIMPLE. OF COURSE, WE TRAPPED OUR PREDATORS, SKINNED, FLESHED AND DRIED THE PELTS, HAD A TANNERY PREPARE THEM IN A GARMENT TAN OR VERY SOFT, HAD ANOTHER VENDOR PRODUCE THIS BEAUTIFUL BLANKET.
YOU1000000039_S0000228	NOW THAT THERE'S FEWER PREDATORS AT THE PROVING GROUNDS, BOTH ME, LOTS OF TURKEYS AND FAWNS WILL SLEEP BETTER THIS SPRING.
YOU1000000039_S0000230	I SURPRISED TRACY WITH THIS BLANKET AND SHE WAS THRILLED. IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS ADDITION TO OUR HOME AND NO DOUBT WILL KEEP US WARM FOR MANY WINTERS TO COME.
YOU1000000039_S0000231	EACH WEEK, I SHARE A REMINDER WITH ALL OF US TO SLOW DOWN AND LISTEN TO THE CREATOR DAILY. I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY THAN SITTING ON A RIDGETOP BEFORE DAYLIGHT, WAITING FOR TURKEYS TO GOBBLE.
YOU1000000039_S0000232	BUT NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, I HOPE YOU TAKE TIME TO ENJOY CREATION THIS WEEK AND SLOW DOWN EVERY DAY AND LISTEN TO WHAT THE CREATOR IS SAYING TO YOU. THANKS FOR WATCHING GROWINGDEER.
YOU1000000039_S0000234	OKAY.

YOU1000000043_S0000007	DURING THIS REVIEW I WILL ALSO COVER THE UPSELLS OF SOCIABLE, WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY COST AND WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT WITH THEM. BUT FIRST LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT MY BONUSES AND HOW THEY HELP YOU WITH SOCIABLE.
YOU1000000043_S0000008	NOW, SOCIABLE IS A PLATFORM THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO POST CONTENT, OTHER PEOPLE'S CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
YOU1000000043_S0000009	AND THEN USE THAT CONTENT TO BUILD YOUR LIST OR MAKE AFFILIATE SALES.
YOU1000000043_S0000010	NOW WITH THESE BONUSES, YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING EVEN BETTER WITH THIS SOFTWARE SO THE FIRST BONUS IS HOW TO BUILD YOUR LIST OF BUYERS ON FACEBOOK
YOU1000000043_S0000011	IN THIS BONUS, I COVER MY STRATEGY FOR FINDING PROVEN BUYERS OF PRODUCTS ON FACEBOOK.
YOU1000000043_S0000012	AND THEN ADDING THEM EITHER TO YOUR FRIENDS LIST, TO YOUR PAGES OR TO YOUR GROUPS. AND THEN YOU CAN USE A SOFTWARE LIKE SOCIABLE TO PROMOTE YOUR OFFERS TO THOSE PEOPLE.
YOU1000000043_S0000013	SO THIS GOES REALLY, REALLY WELL TOGETHER WITH SOCIAL MALL. OBVIOUSLY WITH SOCIAL MALL, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO POST ON FACEBOOK.
YOU1000000043_S0000014	BUT IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE A TARGETED GROUP OF PEOPLE TO POST TO THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A LOT OF RESULTS
YOU1000000043_S0000015	WITH THIS, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET RESULTS REALLY QUICKLY.
YOU1000000043_S0000016	BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE PROVEN BUYERS ON YOUR FACEBOOK FRIENDS LIST OR IN YOUR FACEBOOK GROUPS, AND THEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FOLLOW YOUR OFFERS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE POSTING WITH SOCIABLE.
YOU1000000043_S0000017	BONUS NUMBER TWO IS HOW TO WRITE KILLER HEADLINES. NOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR YOU WANNA BUILD YOUR EMAIL LIST, ONE THING YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION.
YOU1000000043_S0000018	NOW THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION THAN WITH A REALLY GOOD HEADLINE.
YOU1000000043_S0000019	THE PROBLEM IS IT COULD TAKE YOU MONTHS OF TRYING TO LEARN COPYWRITING TO WRITE EFFECTIVE HEADLINES YOURSELF.
YOU1000000043_S0000020	WELL HOWEVER, IF YOU DO WHAT I DO, YOU JUST GO TO THE BEST COPYWRITERS IN THE WORLD, FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF HEADLINES THEY WRITE,
YOU1000000043_S0000021	AND THEN MODEL YOUR OWN HEADLINES BASED ON THOSE HEADLINES, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE A SHORTCUT AND DO THIS IN JUST MINUTES.
YOU1000000043_S0000022	NOW IN BONUS NUMBER TWO, I SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE TO GO TO FIND THESE KILLER HEADLINES AND THEN HOW TO USE THOSE TO BASE YOUR OWN HEADLINES ON THEM.
YOU1000000043_S0000023	BONUS NUMBER THREE IS ALL ABOUT HOW TO PICK A GOOD NICHE. NOW WITH SOCIABLE, YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO AFFILIATE MARKETING IN ALMOST ANY NICHE.
YOU1000000043_S0000024	HOWEVER, YOU DO HAVE TO PICK A GOOD NICHE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY WITH IT
YOU1000000043_S0000025	SO IN BONUS NUMBER THREE, I COVER WHAT GOOD NICHES ARE WHEN IT COMES TO AFFILIATE MARKETING AND HOW TO DECIDE WHICH ONE TO PICK FOR YOURSELF.
YOU1000000043_S0000026	BONUS NUMBER FOUR IS MY EMAIL MARKETING FUNDAMENTALS COURSE.
YOU1000000043_S0000027	NOW WITH SOCIABLE, AS I SAID, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS BUILD YOUR EMAIL LIST WITH THIS TRAFFIC THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE GENERATING WITH THE SOFTWARE.
YOU1000000043_S0000028	AFTER YOU START BUILDING YOUR EMAIL LIST, OF COURSE, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO ACTUALLY DO WITH THAT EMAIL LIST.
YOU1000000043_S0000029	FIRST OF ALL, WHICH SOFTWARE YOU'RE GOING TO USE TO COLLECT YOUR LEADS, HOW TO SET THAT UP.
YOU1000000043_S0000030	AND THEN ALSO HOW TO WRITE EFFECTIVE EMAILS TO THOSE PEOPLE ON YOUR LIST SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TURN THE LEADS INTO SALES. NOW, ALL OF THAT IS COVERED INSIDE MY EMAIL MARKETING FUNDAMENTALS COURSE.
YOU1000000043_S0000031	SO THAT IS BONUS NUMBER FOUR.
YOU1000000043_S0000032	AND THEN BONUS NUMBER FIVE, LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MY FACEBOOK RETARGETING COURSE.
YOU1000000043_S0000033	NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING SOCIABLE TRAFFIC ONE WAY YOU CAN EASILY DOUBLE YOUR RESULTS WITH VERY VERY MINIMAL BUDGET IS BY ADDING FACEBOOK RETARGETING ON TOP OF IT
YOU1000000043_S0000034	NOW I USE FACEBOOK RETARGETING IN MY OWN BUSINESS AND EVERY TIME I DO, I SEE MY RESULTS GO UP SO MUCH MORE.
YOU1000000043_S0000035	BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, EVEN IF 50% OF THE PEOPLE THAT VISIT YOUR WEBSITE SIGN UP TO YOUR MAILING LIST,
YOU1000000043_S0000036	WHICH OBVIOUSLY ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S PROBABLY A LOT LESS THAN THAT. IT'S PROBABLY LIKE 20% BUT EVEN THEN YOU'RE LOSING HALF OF ALL YOUR TRAFFIC
YOU1000000043_S0000037	NOW WHEN YOU DO FACEBOOK RETARGETING YOU GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO TARGET THOSE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T INITIALLY SIGN UP.
YOU1000000043_S0000038	AND GET THEM ONTO YOUR EMAIL LIST OR GET THEM TO BUY A PRODUCT FROM YOU OR A AFFILIATE PRODUCT THAT YOU ARE PROMOTING.
YOU1000000043_S0000039	SO THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO RETARGET ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT LEAVE YOUR WEBSITE WITHOUT TAKING ACTION MAYBE THEY WERE JUST BUSY AT THAT TIME. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT YOUR OFFER IN MORE DETAIL, BUT THEY MIGHT STILL BE INTERESTED
YOU1000000043_S0000040	NOW WITH FACEBOOK RETARGETING, YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO RECAPTURE THOSE PEOPLE, GET THEM ONTO YOUR EMAIL LIST OR GET THEM TO BUY A PRODUCT FROM YOU. AND THIS WILL DEFINITELY DOUBLE YOUR RESULTS.
YOU1000000043_S0000041	NOW ON TOP OF MY OWN BONUSES I'M ALSO GOING TO GIVE YOU ACCESS TO ALL OF THE BONUSES THAT THE VENDOR PROVIDED ME WITH TO GIVE TO YOU

YOU1000000043_S0000097	SO THEN YOU JUST COPY PASTE THIS ARTICLE. UM, AND THEN I CAN GO INTO SOCIAL WELFARE HERE, ADD THIS TO THE STORY.
YOU1000000043_S0000099	OR ADD THIS STORY TO THE BUCKET AND THEN IT SHOULD BE IN HERE SOMEWHERE.
YOU1000000043_S0000100	I GUESS IT'S ON THE NEXT PAGE. OH NO, THIS IS THE ONE. ISHA AMBANI'S WEDDING INCLUDED SPECIAL PERFORMANCE BY BEYONCE. SO I JUST ADDED THAT AS AN EXTRA STORY IN MY BUCKET OF STORIES.
YOU1000000043_S0000101	BUT THIS BUCKET IS AUTOMATICALLY FILLED BY STORIES FROM YOUR CONTENT STREAMS WHEN YOU SET THOSE UP AS WELL.
YOU1000000043_S0000102	THEN OVERLAYS, AS I SAID, OVERLAYS IS BASICALLY WHERE THE MONEY IS, THIS IS THE MAIN FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS SOFTWARE
YOU1000000043_S0000103	SO OBVIOUSLY GETTING THIS CONTENT IS PART OF IT. BUT THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE CONTENT, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DO YOU MONETIZE IT? WELL, WE'RE GOING TO USE IT EITHER TO BUILD OUR LIST OR TO SEND PEOPLE TO AFFILIATE OFFERS WITH THIS CONTENT.
YOU1000000043_S0000104	SO WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THESE OVERLAYS, LET ME SEE IF I CAN ADD MORE OF THOSE. YEAH.
YOU1000000043_S0000105	SO YOU CAN EITHER ADD A BAR, A POP UP, A NOTIFICATION, A FULL SCREEN POP UP OR AN AMAZON PRODUCT ON TOP OF THAT CONTENT.
YOU1000000043_S0000106	SO LET ME JUST SET UP A POP UP IN THIS CASE AND THEN WE HAVE A DIFFERENT POP UPS THAT WE CAN CHOOSE
YOU1000000043_S0000107	SO LET'S DO THIS CALL TO ACTION ONE THEN YOU CAN SEE SO THIS WOULD BE DIRECTING PEOPLE DIRECTLY TO AN AFFILIATE OFFER
YOU1000000043_S0000108	SO LET'S NOT CHOOSE THAT ONE, BUT LET'S CHOOSE ONE THAT IS TO BUILD OUR LIST. SO THAT WOULD BE OPT IN. THEN WE CAN SAY, JOIN OUR COMMUNITY. WE CAN GIVE A DISCOUNT CODE.
YOU1000000043_S0000109	SO YOU CAN SEE ALL THESE DIFFERENT TEMPLATES THEY HAVE ALREADY CREATED. SO THAT MAKES IT SUPER EASY TO GET STARTED WITH THIS.
YOU1000000043_S0000110	SO THIS IS A GOOD LIST BUILDING POP UP IN MY OPINION BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY BASIC AND SIMPLE YET AT THE SAME TIME VERY EYE CATCHING
YOU1000000043_S0000111	SO NOW YOU COULD CHANGE OF COURSE ALL OF THE TEXT OVER HERE SO I CAN JUST TYPE MY OWN AND THAT WILL CHANGE THE HEADLINE OVER HERE
YOU1000000043_S0000112	NOW THIS OF COURSE IS ONE REASON WHY I'M INCLUDING MY BONUS NUMBER TWO ON HOW TO WRITE KILLER HEADLINES BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CREATE YOUR OWN HEADLINE IN THIS POP UP.
YOU1000000043_S0000113	AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A CATCHY HEADLINE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO OPT INTO YOUR LIST FOR.
YOU1000000043_S0000114	SO THIS IS A HEADLINE THAT REALLY INTRIGUES PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THEN AS A CONSEQUENCE, THEY'LL SIGN UP TO YOUR LIST.
YOU1000000043_S0000115	SO THAT IS WHY I'M INCLUDING BONUS NUMBER TWO ALL ABOUT HOW TO WRITE THOSE KILLER HEADLINES
YOU1000000043_S0000116	SO THERE WE GO, THAT IS THAT. YOU CAN CHANGE THIS LOGO THING HERE, YOU CAN CHANGE THE BUTTON, EVEN THE COLOR OF IT.
YOU1000000043_S0000117	SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS, YOU CAN ADD A DELAY SO YOUR POP UP ISN'T SHOWN IMMEDIATELY WHEN PEOPLE OPEN THE PAGE BUT AFTER A FEW SECONDS.
YOU1000000043_S0000118	SO I CAN SAY LIKE FIVE SECONDS FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SAY DOES IT SHOW UP AT THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OR
YOU1000000043_S0000119	OR THE TOP LEFT OR THE TOP RIGHT AS WELL. SO THAT IS LIKE ON THE PAGE, IF YOU HAVE THE WHOLE PAGE.
YOU1000000043_S0000120	THEN IT CAN LIKE POP UP HERE OR IT CAN POP UP HERE OR IT CAN POP UP FROM THE TOP LIKE THAT. SO THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS.
YOU1000000043_S0000121	DO YOU WANT THE CLOSE BUTTON TO SHOW OR NOT? BACKGROUND SETTINGS, SO THIS IS WHITE RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT ANY COLOR REALLY AND THEN IT'S LIKE THAT'S REALLY UGLY
YOU1000000043_S0000122	SO LET'S LEAVE IT WHITE SO FORM EMAIL ADDRESS CALLBACK URL. SO THIS WOULD BE YOUR THANK YOU PAGE. SO THIS IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY WITH THIS
YOU1000000043_S0000123	SO WHEN PEOPLE ENTER THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS AND THEY OPT IN THEN YOU CAN SEND THEM DIRECTLY TO AN AFFILIATE OFFER SO THAT'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO MAKE MONEY WITH THIS
YOU1000000043_S0000124	YOU CAN PUT IN AN AFFILIATE LINK RIGHT HERE AND THEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT OFFER RIGHT AFTER THEY ENTER THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS AND SIGN UP TO YOUR LIST.
YOU1000000043_S0000125	SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN... OKAY, AND THEN AUTORESPONDER, THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD CONNECT YOUR AWEBER OR GETRESPONSE ACCOUNT.
YOU1000000043_S0000126	SO LET ME SET THAT UP. SO LET ME SAVE THIS. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN NOW BECAUSE I HAVE TO GIVE IT A TITLE. SO TITLE TEST ONE.
YOU1000000043_S0000128	SAFE.
YOU1000000043_S0000130	OKAY, NOW I GO TO ALL RESPONDERS SO YOU CAN SEE TEST A ARE A WEBER SO I CAN CHANGE THAT I CAN ADD MY OWN
YOU1000000043_S0000132	AUTORESPONDER
YOU1000000043_S0000134	SO HERE I COULD SELECT A DIFFERENT LIST. OKAY, NOW IT'S GOING TO GO TO AWEBER AND GET ME TO SIGN IN. I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE AN ACTIVE AWEBER ACCOUNT BECAUSE I'M USING GETRESPONSE RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000043_S0000135	SO I HOPE I CAN JUST CANCEL THIS. NO, I CAN'T GO TO MY OVERLAYS. OKAY, HERE WE GO.
YOU1000000043_S0000136	SO THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD NORMALLY LOG INTO YOUR GUT RESPONSE OR A WEB ACCOUNT
YOU1000000043_S0000137	GIVE A SOCIABLE PERMISSION TO USE THAT ACCOUNT SO THAT THEY CAN ADD THEIR EMAIL, THE EMAIL ADDRESSES OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SIGN UP ON THAT POP UP TO YOUR OWN AUTORESPONDER LISTS.
YOU1000000043_S0000138	NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT, AS I SAID, YOU CAN ALSO ADD AMAZON PRODUCTS
YOU1000000043_S0000139	SO HERE FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ADD AN IPHONE AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A POP UP SHOWING THAT IPHONE AS A PRODUCT
YOU1000000043_S0000140	SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD YOUR LIST, YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR OWN WEBSITE, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING YOURSELF.
YOU1000000043_S0000141	YOU JUST WANT TO LIKE SEND PEOPLE TO DIFFERENT PIECES OF CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
YOU1000000043_S0000142	AND THEN GIVE THEM DIFFERENT AMAZON OFFERS AS YOUR AFFILIATE PROMOTIONS, YOU CAN DO THAT WITH THIS SOFTWARE AS WELL. THAT MAY MAKE YOU SOME QUICK MONEY.
YOU1000000043_S0000143	IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A SUPER PROFITABLE LONG TERM BUSINESS, BUT IT COULD DEFINITELY MAKE YOU SOME QUICK CASH WITH THIS.
YOU1000000043_S0000144	SO IF YOU JUST WANT TO QUICKLY MAKE YOUR INVESTMENT INTO SOCIABLE BACK,
YOU1000000043_S0000145	THEN JUST PUTTING OUT A TON OF DIFFERENT CONTENT WITH AMAZON POP UPS COULD BE A GREAT WAY TO IMMEDIATELY MAKE SOME MONEY WITH AMAZON AFFILIATE MARKETING.
YOU1000000043_S0000146	SO THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR OVERLAYS AND THAT IS BASICALLY HOW THIS WORKS
YOU1000000043_S0000148	SO DON'T WE HAVE THE DIFFERENT POSTING CAMPAIGNS? I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW. OKAY. YES, MAYBE I CAN. SO TEST.
YOU1000000043_S0000150	POST TO HERE, BUCKET POSTING FROM THIS BUCKET PER DAY ONE.
YOU1000000043_S0000152	ENABLE OVERLAY SO THAT I CAN CHOOSE WHICH OVERLAY
YOU1000000043_S0000154	GIVEAWAY, OPT IN, SURE, POSTING TIMES. OKAY, SO NOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TIME ZONE TO SEND. SO I'M GONNA SAY ALL THE TIME BUT
YOU1000000043_S0000156	I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GONNA POST DIRECTLY THOUGH, SO I LET ME JUST DOUBLE CHECK THAT ON FACEBOOK OPENING THIS PAGE
YOU1000000043_S0000158	TO SEE IF IT ALREADY POSTED SOMETHING BUT I THINK THIS IS GONNA POST LIKE ONCE A DAY SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY.
YOU1000000043_S0000160	SO THIS IS THE PAGE I ADDED AND OH IT DID. OKAY, COOL. SO I POSTED THAT ARTICLE THAT I JUST GRABBED FROM CNN
YOU1000000043_S0000161	IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMAGE BECAUSE I HAD TO ADD MY OWN IMAGE BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GRAB THE IMAGE FROM CNN BUT YOU CAN SEE IT DID POST THIS
YOU1000000043_S0000162	NOW THIS LINK IS NOT THE ACTUAL LINK TO CNN, IT IS A LINK TO SOCIABLE AND HERE IT SHOULD SHOW THE ARTICLE ON CNN
YOU1000000043_S0000163	BUT IT SEEMS THAT THIS ONE NO LONGER EXISTS FOR SOME REASON, SO THAT'S A BIT WEIRD. BUT IT DOES GO TO THE CNN WEBSITE AS YOU CAN SEE.
YOU1000000043_S0000164	AND OVER HERE WE NOW HAVE THE POP UP, THE OVERLAY THAT WE CREATED SHOWING UP.
YOU1000000043_S0000165	SO THIS IS NOT THE ONE I CREATED JUST NOW. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE JUST I PICKED FROM THE LIST OF OVERLAYS AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN SEE FREE REPORT, LA LA LA, AND THEN YOU CAN SIGN UP HERE.
YOU1000000043_S0000166	AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK ON SEND ME THE REPORT, BUT YOU CAN ALSO CLOSE THIS AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CONTENT AND YOU CAN JUST GO TO HOME.
YOU1000000043_S0000168	I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT DOESN'T WORK. CNN STYLE. HERE WE GO.
YOU1000000043_S0000170	SEEMS THE CNN WEBSITE IS NOT REALLY WORKING WELL INSIDE AN IFRAME. SO THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WEBSITE TO USE WITH SOCIABLE.
YOU1000000043_S0000171	BUT IF WE READ ANY OF THE OTHER ARTICLES, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET A LINK FOR THE OTHER ONES.
YOU1000000043_S0000173	CAN I SEE A PREVIEW SOMEWHERE? LET ME SEE.
YOU1000000043_S0000175	THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BAR PREVIEWS.
YOU1000000043_S0000176	HERE WE GO. A VIEW. YES, THIS IS POSSIBLE. OKAY.
YOU1000000043_S0000178	SO THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. BUT THIS GOES DIRECTLY TO THE ARTICLE ON MEN'S HEALTH, AS YOU CAN SEE, MEN'S JOURNAL IN THIS CASE.
YOU1000000043_S0000179	SO IT DOESN'T SHOW THE SOCIABLE POPUP UNLESS IT IS BEING POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE THIS. SO I CAN'T SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER WEBSITE RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000043_S0000180	SO LET'S IGNORE THAT AND GO BACK TO THE SOFTWARE. SO THAT IS THE LAST THING
YOU1000000043_S0000181	THE CAMPAIGNS IS BASICALLY WHERE YOU SET UP WHEN THE ARTICLE IS POSED WHEN THE ARTICLES ARE POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ACCOUNTS ARE POSTED TO
YOU1000000043_S0000182	I CAN'T ADD ANY MORE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S ON PAUSE RIGHT NOW AS I SAID.
YOU1000000043_S0000183	SO HERE WE GO, TARGET ACCOUNT, WHICH ACCOUNT, WHICH DO YOU WANT BUCKETS OR SINGLE ARTICLES?
YOU1000000043_S0000184	DO YOU WANT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POSTS PER DAY OR PER WEEK OR PER MONTH?
YOU1000000043_S0000185	SO I CAN SAY I WANT 10 POSTS PER DAY, THEN IT JUST KEEPS POSTING 10 TIMES A DAY. AND THEN YOU CAN SAY WHICH TIMES DOES IT POST THAT. DO YOU WANT TO ENABLE OVERLAYS?
YOU1000000043_S0000186	THEN YOU CHOOSE WHICH OVERLAY URL TYPE. THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION, DEFAULT, SO I GUESS THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU CHOOSE.
YOU1000000043_S0000187	THEN POST WITH OVERLAY. HOW MANY OF YOUR POSTS DO HAVE THOSE OVERLAYS?
YOU1000000043_S0000188	SO YOU CAN SAY LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO SPAM PEOPLE WITH THOSE POP UPS ALL THE TIME. SO I ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME RELEVANT CONTENT WITHOUT ANY PROMOTIONS.
YOU1000000043_S0000189	SO I CAN JUST SHOW THE POP UPS ON 50% OF MY POSTS.
YOU1000000043_S0000190	AND THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH OVERLAYS TO USE. SO YOU CAN ADD SEVERAL, SO THEN IT ROTATES BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT OVERLAYS THAT YOU SET UP.
YOU1000000043_S0000191	SO THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST POST THAT SO THAT IS HOW YOU CAN GET THE ACTUAL PROGRAM TO START
YOU1000000043_S0000192	AND THEN IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY WORKS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ANYMORE AFTER THAT. IT JUST KEEPS POSTING CONTENT TO YOUR FACEBOOK OR TWITTER ACCOUNTS OR BOTH IN CASE YOU'VE SET UP
YOU1000000043_S0000194	I SAID A GROUP OF ACCOUNTS AND IT WILL HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT ARTICLES THAT IT PLUGS FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT CONTENT WEBSITES OBVIOUSLY NOT CNN BECAUSE THAT ONE DOESN'T WORK SO WELL
YOU1000000043_S0000195	BUT ANY OTHER CONTENT WEBSITE THAT DOES WORK WELL. I'M ASSUMING THAT THE CONTENT STREAMS THAT ACTUALLY AUTOMATICALLY GET CONTENT, THEY USE WEBSITES WHERE IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY.
YOU1000000043_S0000196	IT'S JUST THAT THE CNN WEBSITE SEEMS TO BLOCK OVERLAYS ON THEIR OWN WEBSITE.
YOU1000000043_S0000198	AND THEN OF COURSE IT PULLS ALL THAT DIFFERENT CONTENT AND THEN POSTS IT ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA
YOU1000000043_S0000199	AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE CLICK ON THOSE DIFFERENT LINKS, THEY WILL BE PRESENTED WITH YOUR POP UPS, WITH YOUR OVERLAYS.
YOU1000000043_S0000200	SO THEY CAN SIGN UP TO YOUR LIST OR GO TO YOUR AFFILIATE OFFERS AND YOU DIRECTLY MAKE MONEY WITH THAT CONTENT.
YOU1000000043_S0000201	SO THIS IS HOW YOU CAN USE SOCIAL WALL TO BASICALLY AUTOMATICALLY DRIVE FREE TRAFFIC, TARGETED TRAFFIC TO YOUR OFFERS.
YOU1000000043_S0000202	NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU WILL NEED A FOLLOWING ON THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS BEAR BONUS NUMBER ONE
YOU1000000043_S0000203	THAT I'M INCLUDING COMES IN REALLY HANDY BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO ADD TONS AND TONS OF TARGETED BUYER FOLLOWERS ON FACEBOOK TO YOUR GROUPS, TO YOUR PAGES OR TO YOUR FRIENDS LIST.
YOU1000000043_S0000204	AND THEN THEY WILL BE THE PEOPLE WHO SEE THOSE POSTS THAT YOUR SOCIAL IS MAKING ON AUTOPILOT. AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TONS AND TONS OF TARGETED TRAFFIC TO YOUR OFFERS.
YOU1000000043_S0000205	SO THAT IS SOCIABLE AND HOW IT WORKS. LET'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THE SALES PAGE. WHERE DID I PUT IT OVER HERE?
YOU1000000043_S0000206	SO ARE YOU FINALLY READY FOR A RELIABLE AND AUTOMATED WAY TO PROFIT FROM THE SOCIAL GIANTS?

YOU1000000043_S0000209	SO AS YOU SAW THAT IT DIDN'T REQUIRE MY OWN WEBSITE BECAUSE I WAS BASICALLY USING OTHER OTHER WEBSITES TO GET THE CONTENT
YOU1000000043_S0000210	I ALSO DIDN'T NEED ANY SEO OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD ONLY BE REQUIRED WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WEBSITE.
YOU1000000043_S0000211	YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR ADS AS YOU CAN JUST POST THIS ON FREE ORGANIC SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS.
YOU1000000043_S0000213	SO YEAH, THIS IS ALL PRETTY LEGIT STUFF.
YOU1000000043_S0000214	SO GETTING UNLIMITED LEADS AND PROFIT OBVIOUSLY WILL REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE A TARGETED FOLLOWING AS I MENTIONED BEFORE.
YOU1000000043_S0000215	BUT THEN BONUS NUMBER ONE IS GOING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT SO GENERATE MASSIVE TRAFFIC LEADS AND SALES IN ANY NICHE FROM THE SOCIAL GIANTS ON COMPLETE AUTOPILOT
YOU1000000043_S0000217	SO HERE YOU SEE, CONNECT YOUR DESIRED SOCIAL ACCOUNTS, INPUT YOUR TARGET KEYWORDS YOU'D LIKE CONTENT FOR AND SET UP YOUR CONTENT STREAM, ETC.
YOU1000000043_S0000218	SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE WHOLE SALES PAGE. IT'S VERY LONG. WHAT I SUGGEST YOU DO IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT, JUST CLICK ON THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW THIS VIDEO, THEN CLICK ON ANY OF THE GREEN BUTTONS OVER HERE.
YOU1000000043_S0000219	AND THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE SALES PAGE AND YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE REST OF IT YOURSELF AT YOUR OWN PACE IN YOUR OWN TIME.
YOU1000000043_S0000220	AND READ THROUGH ALL OF THIS DIFFERENT CONTENT ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE AND ALSO SEE A FEW MORE EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS WORKS REALLY, REALLY WELL WITH THIS SOFTWARE.
YOU1000000043_S0000222	SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PRICING. SO THESE ARE THE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR INITIAL PURCHASE. SOCIABLE LITE AND SOCIABLE PRO. THOSE ARE THE TWO OPTIONS.
YOU1000000043_S0000223	THESE ARE NOT GOING TO BE $87 OR $97, THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THE PRICES AFTER THE LAUNCH.
YOU1000000043_S0000224	SO THE LAUNCH IS GOING TO START TODAY THE 11TH OF DECEMBER 2018 AT 11 A.M EST.
YOU1000000043_S0000225	THAT IS WHEN THE PRICE WILL BE AT ITS POSSIBLE LOWEST POINT, $27 OR $37, SO FOR THE LITE OR THE PRO VERSION
YOU1000000043_S0000226	SO THE DIFFERENCES ARE LIGHT IS LIMITED TO FACEBOOK ONLY, SO NO TWITTER ON LIGHT.
YOU1000000043_S0000227	YOU CAN ADD TWO FACEBOOK PAGES, HAVE A TOTAL OF FIVE CAMPAIGNS AND FIVE CONTENT STREAMS PER MONTH.
YOU1000000043_S0000228	WITH PRO YOU GET BOTH FACEBOOK AND TWITTER, YOU GET 10 PAGES, 10 TWITTER ACCOUNTS, 20 CAMPAIGNS AND A TOTAL OF 20 CONTENT STREAMS PER MONTH.
YOU1000000043_S0000229	SO THAT IS A LOT MORE WITH PRO AND IT'S ONLY 10 BUCKS MORE SO IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO GRAB PRO IF YOU WANT TO GET A LOT OF TRAFFIC FROM THIS METHOD
YOU1000000043_S0000230	THEN IF YOU WANT UNLIMITED PAGES TWITTER ACCOUNTS UNLIMITED POSTINGS AND UNLIMITED CONTENT STREAMS, YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BUY UPGRADE NUMBER ONE
YOU1000000043_S0000231	UPGRADE NUMBER 1 IS THE UNLIMITED AGENCY LICENSE FOR SOCIABLE. YOU CAN CHOOSE EITHER A MONTHLY PAYMENT OF $37 OR A QUARTERLY PAYMENT OF $47.
YOU1000000043_S0000232	NOW, CONSIDERING THAT GIVES YOU THREE MONTHS FOR ONLY 10 BUCKS MORE, IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO GET THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS BECAUSE YOU END UP PAYING ALMOST THREE TIMES AS MUCH.
YOU1000000043_S0000233	SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE QUARTERLY FOR $47 AND YOU'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO SET THIS UP FOR YOUR CLIENTS
YOU1000000043_S0000234	SO IF YOU ARE AN AGENCY, IF YOU DO DIGITAL MARKETING FOR CLIENTS, THEN YOU CAN USE SOCIABLE TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO THEIR OFFERS. SO YOU CAN OFFER THIS AS A SERVICE.
YOU1000000043_S0000235	AND THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE THAT YOU'RE PAYING $47 PER QUARTER FOR THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN CHARGE YOUR CLIENTS LIKE A HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH
YOU1000000043_S0000236	AND EVEN WITH JUST ONE CLIENT, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CHARGE 300 BUCKS PER QUARTER AND YOU'RE ONLY PAYING 47 TO OFFER THEM THIS SERVICE. SO THIS MAKES THIS A REALLY, REALLY GOOD DEAL.
YOU1000000043_S0000237	THEN SOCIABLE REBRAND IS UPGRADE NUMBER TWO THAT IS $97. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO REBRAND YOUR CAMPAIGN WITH CUSTOM DOMAINS
YOU1000000043_S0000238	AND THIS IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO SELL THIS AS A SERVICE ESPECIALLY SO THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN AGENCY'S DOMAIN.
YOU1000000043_S0000239	AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE OFFERING THE SERVICE AND IT'S NOT JUST SOME SERVICE FROM SOCIAL BALL THAT YOU'RE RESELLING.
YOU1000000043_S0000240	BECAUSE THEN YOUR CLIENTS MIGHT JUST GO TO SOCIABLE DIRECTLY AND SKIP YOU AS AN INTERMEDIARY.
YOU1000000043_S0000241	SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT, YOU CAN BASICALLY REBRAND SOCIABLE, GIVE IT ANY NAME YOU WANT, OR THE NAME OF YOUR OWN AGENCY. AND THAT IS A ONE TIME PAYMENT OF $97 ALLOWING YOU THAT FUNCTION.
YOU1000000043_S0000242	THEN OVERLAY TEMPLATE BUNDLE UNLOCKS A LOT OF EXTENDED TEMPLATES SO YOU SAW INSIDE SOCIAL WALL IT HAD A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT TEMPLATES FOR THESE OVERLAYS
YOU1000000043_S0000243	NOW IF YOU WANT A TON MORE OVERLAYS THEN FOR $67 YOU CAN PICK UP OTO NUMBER 3 THAT GIVES YOU A LOT MORE TEMPLATES FOR YOUR OVERLAYS
YOU1000000043_S0000244	AND THAT'S ONLY A ONE TIME PAYMENT AS WELL. SO THAT IS A GREAT DEAL AS WELL.

YOU1000000045_S0000024	YOU HAVE A BUILT IN HALLOWEEN CROWD WHERE PEOPLE ARE, CHESAKINS, YOU'RE LIKE, NO, IT'S GOOD MAKEUP THOUGH, RIGHT? YEAH, IT'S A GOOD.
YOU1000000045_S0000025	YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL SAY TO US, YOU KNOW, DO YOU KNOW YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HILLARY CLINTON? AND I SAY, YEAH, I'VE HEARD THAT.
YOU1000000045_S0000026	LET ME, UM, SAY, FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON A PHENOMENAL BOOK. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. THE BOOK OF GUTSY WOMEN.
YOU1000000045_S0000027	I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS GONNA BE A BOOK ABOUT AMERICAN WOMEN, A BOOK ABOUT POLITICAL WOMEN, BUT IT'S JUST A BOOK ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAVE CHANGED NOT JUST THEIR WORLD, BUT THE WORLD IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
YOU1000000045_S0000028	WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT YOU WROTE IT TOGETHER. YOU'VE WRITTEN MANY BOOKS SEPARATELY, BUT THIS WAS YOUR FIRST BOOK WRITING TOGETHER AS A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
YOU1000000045_S0000029	AS SOMEONE WHO'S WRITTEN A BOOK WITHOUT MY MOTHER, I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO WRITE SOMETHING WITH MY MOTHER.
YOU1000000045_S0000030	HOW DO YOU NOT HATE EACH OTHER AT THIS POINT? WHAT IS THE PROCESS LIKE?
YOU1000000045_S0000031	IT WAS A LOT OF FUN. IT ALSO DID TAKE SOME ADJUSTMENT. BECAUSE MY MOTHER STILL WRITES LOG YET.
YOU1000000045_S0000032	LIKE LIKE YEAH WRITES OUT THE WORDS
YOU1000000045_S0000033	I SAID THIS AT AN EVENT AND I COULD SEE A TEENAGER UP IN THE RAFTERS TURN TO HIS MOTHER AND SAY, WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU1000000045_S0000035	BECAUSE THERE'S A GENERATION THAT GOES LIKE, WHAT IS THAT? WRITING THE WORDS OUT WITH A PEN AND NO AUTO CORRECT.
YOU1000000045_S0000036	NO, AND LIKE NO ABILITY TO TRACK CHANGES OR HAVE COMMENT BOXES, RIGHT?
YOU1000000045_S0000037	AND YOU'RE DOING IT, LIKE, ARE YOU DOING IT ON COMPUTER?
YOU1000000045_S0000038	YES, LIKE 2019.
YOU1000000045_S0000039	HOW DO YOU... SO HOW DO YOU COMPARE THE NOTES, THEN? WHEN YOU, LIKE, DO YOU BRING THE LONGHAND INTO THE DIGITAL, OR DO YOU, LIKE, GIVE IT TO HER AND BE LIKE, YOU LONGHAND MY WORK?
YOU1000000045_S0000040	WELL, SO MY MOTHER WOULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF, LIKE, EACH PAGE. WOW. AND THEN TEXT OR E MAIL ME THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PAGE. WOW. YEAH, SO...
YOU1000000045_S0000041	LIKE WHEN WE WERE PARTICULARLY WORKING ON THE THINGS THAT WE WROTE TOGETHER, LIKE WE WRITE ABOUT ROSA PARKS AND CLAUDETTE COLVIN TOGETHER.
YOU1000000045_S0000042	SO I WOULD LIKE TYPE MY CLAUDETTE COLVIN ESSAY AND SEND IT TO HER AS AN ATTACHMENT LIKE A WORD DOCUMENT
YOU1000000045_S0000043	AND SHE WOULD TAKE PICTURES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PAGE OF HER ROSA PARKS ESSAY AND SEND ME PAGE ONE.
YOU1000000045_S0000044	I CAN FEEL YOUR FRUSTRATION AS YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS STORY. I'M STILL WORKING THROUGH IT. THIS IS... THIS IS NICE. I CAN FEEL THAT.
YOU1000000045_S0000045	UM, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO WRITE THIS BOOK TOGETHER? I MEAN, YOU'VE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES. YOU COULD HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT ANYTHING. YOUR FAMILY, POLITICS, YOUR LIFE.
YOU1000000045_S0000046	BUT THIS IS A SPECIFIC BOOK, AND IT FEELS LIKE FOR A SPECIFIC TIME. WHY?
YOU1000000045_S0000048	BECAUSE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT IN TODAY'S WORLD, THE STORIES OF GUTSY WOMEN, AND LITERALLY THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS OF THEM.
YOU1000000045_S0000049	BUT WE CHOSE 103 TO WRITE ABOUT.
YOU1000000045_S0000050	BECAUSE THEIR STORIES TELL US YES, ABOUT THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY ENDURED.
YOU1000000045_S0000051	AND THEIR PERSISTENCE TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND THE LIVES OF PEOPLE AROUND THEM.
YOU1000000045_S0000052	BUT I THINK, ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S WORLD, WE NEED TO BE REMINDED OF THESE KINDS OF STORIES. AND THEY ARE HISTORIC AND CONTEMPORARY AND EVEN A FEW FICTIONAL.
YOU1000000045_S0000053	AND THEY WERE WOMEN WHO INSPIRED ME AS A LITTLE GIRL AND THEN THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND THE SAME WITH CHELSEA.
YOU1000000045_S0000054	IN FACT, WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT INSPIRATIONAL WOMEN WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL.
YOU1000000045_S0000055	AND SO WE WANT TO SHARE THESE STORIES AND WE HOPE THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND SOME MESSAGE THAT WILL HELP THEM.
YOU1000000045_S0000056	RIGHT.
YOU1000000045_S0000057	ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, GIVEN THE DIFFICULTIES THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD FACE RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000045_S0000058	IT'S INTERESTING, CHELSEA, BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU WATCHED YOUR MOM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, AND THERE WERE MORE WOMEN IN SPACE THAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000059	TO
YOU1000000045_S0000060	RIGHT. AND NOW YOU YOU HAVE A PLETHORA OF WOMEN. I MEAN, YOU HAVE SIX IN THE RACE, AND YOU'VE SEEN HOW MANY WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN IN THE MIDTERMS AND WON, AS WELL.
YOU1000000045_S0000061	DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOTICING A SHIFT IN SOCIETY THAT'S POSITIVELY MOVING US TO A PLACE WHERE THERE'S EQUALITY? NOT THERE YET, BUT JUST MOVING US IN THAT DIRECTION?
YOU1000000045_S0000062	I THINK WE'RE ABSOLUTELY MAKING PROGRESS. I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE HOW YOU FRAMED THE QUESTION, TREVOR, BECAUSE IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T GET COMPLACENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000063	AND THAT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND STILL HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO.
YOU1000000045_S0000064	I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF WOMEN RUN FOR CONGRESS IN 2018, WE WERE STILL LESS THAN A QUARTER OF ALL DECLARED CANDIDATES.
YOU1000000045_S0000065	WOW.
YOU1000000045_S0000066	SO MAKING PROGRESS, BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO TO GET TO PARODY. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN, LIKE WHO RUNS FOR OFFICE REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IT DETERMINES WHO HOLDS OFFICE.
YOU1000000045_S0000067	AND I'M SO THRILLED THAT MY CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP WITH THE MOST DIVERSE CONGRESS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
YOU1000000045_S0000068	YOU HAVE CHOSEN 103 WOMEN IN THIS BOOK WHO ALL HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES OF BEING GUTSY, BUT WHAT WOULD YOU FIND WAS THE COMMON THREAD THAT MADE THEM WHO THEY ARE?
YOU1000000045_S0000069	ONE, I THINK THE SENSE OF JUST DEEP PURPOSE. SOMETIMES SOMETHING THAT THEY KNEW FROM WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE GIRLS.
YOU1000000045_S0000070	LIKE JANE GOODALL ALWAYS KNEW SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH ANIMALS. AND SALLY RIDE, THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN IN SPACE.
YOU1000000045_S0000071	REALLY BECAME A PHYSICIST BECAUSE SHE WASN'T A GOOD ENOUGH TENNIS PLAYER. SO SHE KIND OF FOUND HER PASSION LATER IN LIFE.
YOU1000000045_S0000072	BUT WHAT IS SO DISTINCTIVE ABOUT ALL THESE WOMEN IS THAT THEY BROUGHT OTHERS ALONG WITH THEM.
YOU1000000045_S0000073	SOMETIMES CONSCIOUSLY BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND SOMETIMES JUST REALLY AWARE OF THEIR EXAMPLE.
YOU1000000045_S0000074	AND I FIND THAT REALLY POWERFUL AND GUTSY, THAT IT WASN'T JUST FOR THEMSELVES, IT WAS FOR OTHERS TOO.
YOU1000000045_S0000075	HILLARY, I HAVE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUING ME FOR A WHILE. HOW DID YOU KILL JEFFREY EPSTEIN?
YOU1000000045_S0000077	BECAUSE YOU, YOU, YOU'RE NOT IN POWER, BUT YOU HAVE ALL THE POWER.
YOU1000000045_S0000079	I I REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU DO.
YOU1000000045_S0000080	BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO BE BEHIND EVERYTHING NEFARIOUS, AND YET YOU DO NOT USE IT TO BECOME PRESIDENT. WHAT IS THE GAME PLAN?
YOU1000000045_S0000082	WELL, TREVOR.
YOU1000000045_S0000084	WHAT DOES... BUT HONESTLY, THOUGH, WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE BEING THE BOOGEYMAN OF THE RIGHT?
YOU1000000045_S0000085	WELL, IT'S A CONSTANT SURPRISE TO ME.
YOU1000000045_S0000086	BECAUSE THE THINGS THEY SAY, AND NOW, OF COURSE, IT'S ON STEROIDS WITH BEING ONLINE.
YOU1000000045_S0000087	ARE SO RIDICULOUS BEYOND ANY IMAGINATION THAT I COULD HAVE.
YOU1000000045_S0000088	AND YET THEY ARE SO PERSISTENT IN PUTTING FORTH THESE CRAZY IDEAS AND THEORIES.
YOU1000000045_S0000089	HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EVER DID TO GET THEM SO UPSET.
YOU1000000045_S0000090	BUT A LOT OF THEM LIVE TO COME UP WITH THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.
YOU1000000045_S0000091	AND I'VE GOTTEN KIND OF USED TO IT. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.
YOU1000000045_S0000092	HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF JUST, LIKE, MEETING SOMEONE WHO SAYS, LIKE, YOU DID THIS, AND JUST LOOKING AT THEM AND BEING LIKE, YES, I DID?
YOU1000000045_S0000094	I MEAN, THERE MUST BE A LITTLE... AT SOME POINT. RIGHT, AT SOME POINT. YEAH, AT SOME POINT. IT BECOMES SO LUDICROUS AND IT BECOMES SO EXTREME.
YOU1000000045_S0000095	WELL, I'VE HAD ENCOUNTERS LIKE THAT, AND MANY OF MY FRIENDS HAVE HAD, BECAUSE
YOU1000000045_S0000096	WOW.
YOU1000000045_S0000097	YEAH, THEY'VE CALLED UP PEOPLE TO URGE THEM TO VOTE FOR ME.
YOU1000000045_S0000098	THEY'VE KNOCKED ON A DOOR AND SOMEBODY WILL SAY, OH, I COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE, AND THEN THEY LAUNCH INTO ONE OF THEIR BIG CONSPIRACIES.
YOU1000000045_S0000099	AND I HAD ONE FRIEND, ONE VERY DEAR FRIEND, WHO I LITERALLY HAVE KNOWN MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND SHE SAID SHE LISTENED TO THIS RIDICULOUS CONSPIRACY ABOUT ME.
YOU1000000045_S0000100	AND SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, I'VE KNOWN HER SINCE WE WERE IN SIXTH GRADE, AND NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. AND THIS MAN LOOKED AT HER AND SAID, BUT I SAW IT ON THE INTERNET.
YOU1000000045_S0000102	BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT IS EFFECTIVE. LIKE, I'LL NEVER FORGET READING AN ARTICLE AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION
YOU1000000045_S0000103	WHERE THE REPORTER INTERVIEWED SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN AN UNDECIDED VOTER.
YOU1000000045_S0000104	AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE THOUGHT MY MOM HAD WON ALL THREE DEBATES. SHE CLEARLY HAD A GREATER COMMAND OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. AND YET HE JUST KEPT READING THAT SHE HAD MURDERED MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE.
YOU1000000045_S0000105	AND HE SAID SOMEWHAT NONCHALANTLY LIKE I DON'T THINK THAT SHE MURDERED 50, BUT LIKE WHAT IF SHE MURDERED TWO?
YOU1000000045_S0000106	AND SO YOU JUST THINK IT'S THIS LIKE CONSTANT EROSION OF TRUTH AND SANITY.
YOU1000000045_S0000107	RIGHT.
YOU1000000045_S0000108	BUT MY FAVORITE, AND THE ONE THAT I DO SECRETLY HOPE MAY BE TRUE, IS THAT MY MOTHER APPARENTLY ADOPTED AN ALIEN IN 1993. AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A SIBLING.
YOU1000000045_S0000109	MAYBE THAT ONE WILL PROVE.
YOU1000000045_S0000110	TREVOR, YOU HAVE TO LAUGH AT IT BECAUSE IT'S SO CRAZY. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE FACE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
YOU1000000045_S0000111	OF A LOT OF THESE FALSEHOODS AND THESE CRAZY STORIES TAKING ON LIVES OF THEIR OWN.
YOU1000000045_S0000112	NOT ABOUT ME, BUT ABOUT EVERYBODY, AND PARTICULARLY ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC ARENA.
YOU1000000045_S0000113	AND I HAVE BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE DECISION BY FACEBOOK TO ALLOW TRULY FALSE POLITICAL ADS TO BE RUN.
YOU1000000045_S0000114	I WANT TO APPLAUD TWITTER FOR ANNOUNCING THEY WERE NOT GOING TO LET THAT GO FORWARD. AND I HOPE, I REALLY HOPE FACEBOOK CHANGES THEIR MIND.
YOU1000000045_S0000115	BECAUSE MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA GET THEIR NEWS FROM FACEBOOK. AND YOU. I MEAN, THAT'S THE...
YOU1000000045_S0000116	WELL, BUT... NO, BUT FACEBOOK... BUT FACEBOOK IS IS A REAL ISSUE, AND WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE NO LONGER KNOW WHAT TRUTH IS AND DON'T EVEN AGREE ON IT, WHICH WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LARGER ISSUE.
YOU1000000045_S0000117	YOU'VE WITNESSED THE CHANGE IN POLITICS THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT TIMES.
YOU1000000045_S0000118	UH, IN FACT, WE'RE IN AN INTERESTING PERIOD NOW WHERE THE COUNTRY'S GEARING UP FOR IMPEACHMENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000119	AND YOU ARE IN AN INTERESTING POSITION, WHERE, IN YOUR LIFE, YOU HAVE BEEN LITERALLY A PART OF EVERY SINGLE IMPEACHMENT IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
YOU1000000045_S0000120	YOU HAD THE WATERGATE INVESTIGATIONS THAT YOU WERE A PART OF. YOU THEN HAD YOUR HUSBAND, WHO WAS IMPEACHED, AND NOW YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT IS GETTING IMPEACHED.
YOU1000000045_S0000121	DO YOU HAVE THE IMPEACHMENT TOUCH? IS THIS, LIKE, A THING?
YOU1000000045_S0000122	YOU KNOW, I WASN'T PART OF ANDREW JOHNSON, BUT YOU KNOW OTHER
YOU1000000045_S0000123	IT IS A STRANGE PERSPECTIVE TO HAVE BECAUSE I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER INVESTIGATING RICHARD NIXON.
YOU1000000045_S0000124	AND I AM VERY PLEASED THAT THE HOUSE TODAY IS PROCEEDING IN SUCH A DELIBERATIVE MANNER. THEY HAD THAT VOTE TODAY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES.
YOU1000000045_S0000125	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN 1974. AT FIRST, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE IDEA THAT NIXON WOULD BE IMPEACHED AFTER HE WON A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE IN 1972.
YOU1000000045_S0000126	AND THEY THOUGHT, WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. BUT AS THE EVIDENCE CAME OUT, AND WE WERE LITERALLY WORKING 18 HOURS A DAY.
YOU1000000045_S0000127	COMPILING EVIDENCE, MAKING THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS.
YOU1000000045_S0000128	AND FINALLY, PEOPLE REALIZED THAT...
YOU1000000045_S0000129	YEAH, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, ABUSE OF POWER, CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS ARE NOT WHAT WE WANT TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO IN OUR COUNTRY.
YOU1000000045_S0000130	WE NEED CHECKS AND BALANCES. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE RULE OF LAW IS AT THE CORE OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
YOU1000000045_S0000131	SO I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ABOUT HOW THE HOUSE'S POWER IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.
YOU1000000045_S0000132	BECAUSE I WAS PART OF SEEING IT WORK, I BELIEVE, IN THE RIGHT WAY. ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE PROFILE IS BARBARA JORDAN.
YOU1000000045_S0000133	WHO, IF YOU GO TO YOUTUBE, YOU CAN SEE HER SPEECH WHEN SHE VOTED ON THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT IN 1974 WITH HER DEFENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION.
YOU1000000045_S0000134	AND SO I'M HOPING THAT NOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO MOVE TOWARD PUBLIC HEARINGS.
YOU1000000045_S0000135	WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE THESE WITNESSES IN PERSON. THEY CAN BE LIKE A JUROR THEMSELVES TRYING TO DECIDE.
YOU1000000045_S0000136	THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL, YOU KNOW, MAKE A VERY CAREFUL STUDY OF WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD.
YOU1000000045_S0000137	BECAUSE THE FOUNDERS PUT IMPEACHMENT IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR A REASON.
YOU1000000045_S0000138	WE HAVE ELECTIONS, BUT IN BETWEEN ELECTIONS, IF THERE'S BEHAVIOR THAT IS UNDERMINING OUR COUNTRY, ENDANGERING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY,
YOU1000000045_S0000139	AS THE ALLEGATIONS HERE ARE. IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY REMEDY, BUT ONE THAT HAS TO BE EXERCISED IN A SOBER, CAREFUL WAY.
YOU1000000045_S0000140	IT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE AMERICA'S IN A PLACE WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THIS PROCESS AND PROCEDURE WILL BE TESTED MORE THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE OF HOW PARTISAN AMERICA HAS BECOME.
YOU1000000045_S0000141	BECAUSE OF HOW, YOU KNOW, TOXIC POLITICS IN AMERICA HAS BECOME.
YOU1000000045_S0000142	AND I I WAS INTERESTED, CHELSEA, BECAUSE I'VE NOTICED A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED YOU WHY YOU AREN'T RUNNING FOR AN OPEN SEAT IN CHAPPAQUA.
YOU1000000045_S0000143	YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEW YORK STATE. THERE IS A SEAT THAT IS OPEN, AND YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THAT SEAT. IN MANY PEOPLE'S OPINION,
YOU1000000045_S0000144	AND YOU'VE OFTEN SAID, NO, THERE'S OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COULD TAKE IT. AND EVERYONE SAID, YES, BUT YOU WOULD DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW, TAKE THAT SEAT AND YOU WOULD RUN WITH IT. AND YOU'VE SAID YOU ARE INTERESTED IN CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES.
YOU1000000045_S0000145	DO YOU EVER HESITA... HESITANCY TO ENGAGE IN POLITICS BECAUSE OF HOW YOUR MOM HAS BEEN TREATED IN HER LIFE?
YOU1000000045_S0000146	NO, BECAUSE I SEE HER GET UP EVERY DAY AND STILL ENGAGE.
YOU1000000045_S0000147	AND SO FOR ME, THE DECISION TO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT KIND OF RUNNING FOR
YOU1000000045_S0000148	THE SEAT THAT CONGRESSWOMAN NITA LOWEY WILL LEAVE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR.
YOU1000000045_S0000149	IS MORE ABOUT AN AFFIRMATION OF WHAT I'M DOING NOW.
YOU1000000045_S0000150	AND I'M THRILLED THAT THERE ARE ALREADY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THROWN THEIR HATS INTO THE RING.
YOU1000000045_S0000151	AND I HOPE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T KIND OF SEE THE TOXICITY IN THIS MOMENT AND TURN AWAY FROM IT. I HOPE THEY SEE IT AND SAY, I WANT TO CHANGE THAT.
YOU1000000045_S0000152	AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO A PLACE OF SCIENCE AND EVIDENCE BASED DECISIONS AND RESPECT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
YOU1000000045_S0000153	SO I HOPE PEOPLE TAKE IT PERVERSELY AS AN OPPORTUNITY.
YOU1000000045_S0000154	RIGHT.
YOU1000000045_S0000155	FOR WHAT MUST BE DIFFERENT AND THEN BE PART OF THE CHANGE OF DOING THAT.
YOU1000000045_S0000156	BECAUSE IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT. WE'VE HAD PARTISANSHIP FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
YOU1000000045_S0000157	BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT TO FIND COMMON GROUND. SO BACK TO THE NIXON IMPEACHMENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000158	WHEN THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT WERE VOTED ON, MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE CONGRESS VOTED FOR ONE OR MORE OF THEM.
YOU1000000045_S0000159	SO THERE HAS BEEN MANY TIMES WE'VE
YOU1000000045_S0000160	YOU WRITE ABOUT MARGARET CHASE SMITH, A REPUBLICAN WOMAN SENATOR FROM MAINE, WHO WAS THE FIRST MEMBER OF HER PARTY TO STAND UP TO JOSEPH MCCARTHY IN THE EARLY 1950S.
YOU1000000045_S0000161	SO WE'VE HAD NOT ONLY PEOPLE, BUT A CONSENSUS AROUND WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT AND CHERISH.
YOU1000000045_S0000162	AND SO I CAN HOPE THAT MAYBE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR DECISION NOT ON PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT, BUT PROTECTING THE COUNTRY.
YOU1000000045_S0000163	EITHER WAY, THEY END UP.
YOU1000000045_S0000164	IT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE MANY OF THE THE WOMEN YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT IN THE BOOK ALSO SHARE ONE COMMON TRAIT, AND THAT IS THE OBSTACLES THEY HAD TO OVERCOME
YOU1000000045_S0000165	OFTEN INCLUDED BEING ACCUSED OF THINGS OR BEING SCRUTINIZED IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT SIMILAR TO THE MEN AROUND THEM, TO THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS.
YOU1000000045_S0000166	HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO A TRUMP SUPPORTER IF THEY TOOK THE TIME TO LISTEN TO YOU AND SAID,
YOU1000000045_S0000167	HILLARY, I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT TRUMP IS GONNA BE IMPEACHED FOR GETTING INFORMATION FROM UKRAINE.
YOU1000000045_S0000168	WHEN YOUR TEAM ENGAGED IN RUSSIAN INFORMATION THROUGH, UH, YOU KNOW, THE CO... THE THE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THAT SIDE ON THE STEELE DOSSIER.
YOU1000000045_S0000169	HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT PERSON WHEN THEY SAY, YOU ENGAGED IN FOREIGN INFORMATION ON A POLITICAL RIVAL, TRUMP DID THE SAME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
YOU1000000045_S0000170	THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE. YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE POWER THAT THE PRESIDENT HOLDS,
YOU1000000045_S0000171	THE PRESIDENT IS IN A POSITION TO USE AMERICAN LEVERAGE AND CREDIBILITY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF OUR NATION.
YOU1000000045_S0000172	SO I COULD IMAGINE, NO, I COULD IMAGINE A CONVERSATION WHERE A PRESIDENT WOULD SAY TO THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE,
YOU1000000045_S0000173	YOU'RE NEW AT THE JOB. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS HELD YOU BACK IS CORRUPTION. WE WANT TO HELP YOU FIGHT CORRUPTION.
YOU1000000045_S0000174	BUT WE WANT EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE REALLY DEDICATED TO FIGHTING CORRUPTION. IF THAT'S ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID,
YOU1000000045_S0000175	THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
YOU1000000045_S0000176	AS SECRETARY OF STATE, I USED TO GO AND VISIT LEADERS AND SAY, YOU KNOW, ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS YOU'VE GOT RAMPANT CORRUPTION.
YOU1000000045_S0000177	IT'S IN YOUR FAMILY. IT'S IN YOUR PEOPLE AROUND YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT.
YOU1000000045_S0000178	BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. AND WE NOW HAVE NOT ONLY THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND THE ALLEGED INCOMPLETE TRANSCRIPT,
YOU1000000045_S0000179	WE NOW HAVE A LOT OF WITNESSES WHO ARE ALL SAYING THIS WAS ABOUT HELPING THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.
YOU1000000045_S0000180	HE IS ACTING AS THE PRESIDENT. HE'S NOT A POLITICAL CANDIDATE. HE IS NOT A PRIVATE CITIZEN. HE'S THE PRESIDENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000181	THAT WORKS FOR THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000045_S0000182	HE WORKS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WE DON'T WANT TO SQUANDER OUR CREDIBILITY.
YOU1000000045_S0000183	SO IF OTHER COUNTRIES SEE THIS, AS THEY CLEARLY ARE,
YOU1000000045_S0000184	THAT THIS PRESIDENT REALLY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT UKRAINE, COULD CARE LESS WHETHER IT BECOMES A STABLE COUNTRY, COULD CARE LESS WHETHER IT'S ABLE TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST RUSSIA.
YOU1000000045_S0000185	ALL HE WANTS IS FOR THEM TO MANUFACTURE SOME KIND OF DAMAGING INFORMATION.
YOU1000000045_S0000186	ABOUT THE PERSON HE THINKS IS HIS LIKELY OPPONENT, JOE BIDEN.
YOU1000000045_S0000187	SO THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I MEAN, PEOPLE CAN GATHER INFORMATION IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS.
YOU1000000045_S0000188	BUT WHEN YOU COMBINE IT WITH THAT QUID PRO QUO THAT EXISTED IN THAT CONVERSATION, WHICH HAS NOW BEEN VERIFIED REPEATEDLY
YOU1000000045_S0000189	BY PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM, PEOPLE WHO WERE UNDER PRESSURE.
YOU1000000045_S0000190	TO DEPRIVE THE UKRAINIANS OF MILITARY AID SO THEY COULD DEFEND THEMSELVES. THERE'S AN ACTIVE WAR GOING ON IN EASTERN UKRAINE.
YOU1000000045_S0000191	THE RUSSIANS AND THEIR PROXIES ARE STILL KILLING UKRAINIANS.
YOU1000000045_S0000192	WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BASICALLY DONE IS SAY, I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT. I JUST NEED SOME DIRT.
YOU1000000045_S0000193	AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU MAKE IT UP. IN ORDER TO GET MILITARY AID, YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME SOMETHING ON JOE BIDEN AND HIS SON.
YOU1000000045_S0000194	IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE TRUMP HAS TAKEN, UH, AN UNCONVENTIONAL, UH, APPROACH, AT... TO SAY THE LEAST, IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.
YOU1000000045_S0000195	HE'S BEEN VERY EXPLICIT IN SAYING, IT'S AMERICA FIRST AND THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT. SYRIA HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING CASE.
YOU1000000045_S0000196	AND AND AS A FORMER SECRETARY, YOU YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK TO THIS WITH AN IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE.
YOU1000000045_S0000197	TRUMP SAID, I PULLED THE TROOPS OUT BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO LEAVE THESE ENDLESS WARS. EVERYONE SPOKE OUT AGAINST TRUMP FOR DOING THIS.
YOU1000000045_S0000198	BUT IT WAS ONE OF YOUR FORMER AMBASSADORS, ROBERT FORD, WHO SAID AT ONE POINT THAT THE ALLIANCE WITH THE KURDS WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE PERMANENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000199	IT WAS JUST MEANT TO BE A TEMPORARY COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE BOTH SIDES WANTED TO BEAT ISIS, AND THEY WEREN'T ALLIES OF ALL TIME. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MORE CORRECT APPROACH, THEN?
YOU1000000045_S0000200	LOOK, I DON'T THINK HIS REAL PHILOSOPHY IS AMERICA FIRST. I THINK IT'S TRUMP FIRST. AND HE JUDGES EVERYTHING AS TO HOW IT WILL HELP HIM.
YOU1000000045_S0000201	AND PERHAPS HE IMPULSIVELY DECIDED THAT BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME WAS GOOD FOR HIM POLITICALLY.
YOU1000000045_S0000202	AND THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE IS JUSTIFYING IT.
YOU1000000045_S0000203	BUT LET'S ASSUME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WAS INTERESTED IN ACHIEVING THAT GOAL IN A DEFENSIBLE WAY.
YOU1000000045_S0000204	HERE'S WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. HE COULD HAVE VERY WELL HAVE SAID TO THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SYRIA, THE KURDS, THE TURKS, AND OTHERS,
YOU1000000045_S0000205	AND SAID, WE NEED TO START A PROCESS IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT THE KURDS, WHO HAVE BEEN OUR ALLIES.
YOU1000000045_S0000206	MAYBE NOT FOR ALL TIME.
YOU1000000045_S0000207	BUT THEY SURE HAVE BEEN SACRIFICING ON BEHALF OF OUR OBJECTIVE TO DRIVE THE ISLAMIC STATE OUT OF SYRIA.
YOU1000000045_S0000208	AND WE KNOW THEY'RE HOLDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS FOR US. SO LET'S NOT LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FATES.
YOU1000000045_S0000209	LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE WORK WITH THE TURKS, WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR BORDER. LET'S SEE HOW WE WORK WITH THE KURDS. LET'S USE THE LEVERAGE WE HAVE.
YOU1000000045_S0000210	BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE TROOPS THAT ARE SPECIAL FORCES WHO ARE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE KURDS. AND LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
YOU1000000045_S0000211	INSTEAD OF JUST WAKING UP AND WALKING TO THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAY, WE'RE BRINGING ALL OUR TROOPS HOME, AND I'VE TALKED TO PRESIDENT ERDOGAN.
YOU1000000045_S0000212	AND SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAYS ON THESE CALLS, FOR ALL WE KNOW, IT COULD BE, HEY, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT ERDOGAN, WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR TROOPS OUT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON JOE BIDEN?
YOU1000000045_S0000213	WE DON'T KNOW.
YOU1000000045_S0000214	RIGHT.
YOU1000000045_S0000215	AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO FRIGHTENING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
YOU1000000045_S0000216	BECAUSE HE HAS AN AFFINITY FOR DICTATORS. HE'S CLEARLY MISJUDGED THE NORTH KOREANS.
YOU1000000045_S0000217	KIM JONG UN HAS BEEN FIRING MISSILES AND OBVIOUSLY NOT BEHAVING THE WAY THAT A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE LED HIM TO.
YOU1000000045_S0000218	HE CLEARLY DOES PUTIN'S BIDDING. I MEAN, PUTIN COULD NOT BE HAPPIER TO HAVE THE UKRAINIANS CAUGHT UP IN THIS.
YOU1000000045_S0000219	WHILE HE CONTINUES TO EAT AWAY AT THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR SOVEREIGNTY.
YOU1000000045_S0000220	THE RUSSIANS HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
YOU1000000045_S0000221	BECAUSE THEY'RE RIGHT THERE IN SYRIA ALONGSIDE THE IRANIANS AND PROPPING UP THE ASSAD GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000222	SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PIECES ON THIS COMPLEX CHESSBOARD.
YOU1000000045_S0000223	AND I'VE BEEN IN A WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS DEMANDING INFORMATION.
YOU1000000045_S0000224	NOT ACTING ON IMPULSE, WHERE WE WERE RUNNING THROUGH DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, WHERE WE HAD TO BE CONSTANTLY TESTING OUR OPINIONS AGAINST OTHERS.
YOU1000000045_S0000225	IN ORDER TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE BEST ADVICE. THAT IS NOT HAPPENING IN THIS WHITE HOUSE.
YOU1000000045_S0000226	IT IS, UNFORTUNATELY, UNPREDICTABLE ABOUT WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT.
YOU1000000045_S0000227	SO THEREFORE, OTHER COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY ONES ADVERSARIAL TO US,
YOU1000000045_S0000228	ARE GOING AROUND THE WORLD SAYING, YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T COUNT ON AMERICA ANYMORE. YOU KNOW? COUNT ON US.
YOU1000000045_S0000229	WE'LL SELL YOU ARMS, NOT THE AMERICANS. WE'LL MAKE DEALS WITH YOU, NOT THE AMERICANS. WE'LL HAVE INVESTMENTS IN YOUR COUNTRY, NOT THE AMERICANS.
YOU1000000045_S0000230	AND IT'S A TRAGEDY.
YOU1000000045_S0000231	BECAUSE I THINK WE WERE REALLY WELL POSITIONED AT THE END OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP BUILDING ON OUR LEADERSHIP.
YOU1000000045_S0000232	AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN SQUANDERED UNDER THIS PRESIDENT.
YOU1000000045_S0000233	LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION BEFORE WE WRAP IT UP. THE BOOK OF GUTSY WOMEN TALKS ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAVE DONE SOMETHING AMAZING THROUGHOUT TIME.
YOU1000000045_S0000234	ONE THING THAT WE CAN'T DENY HAS CHANGED THROUGHOUT TIME HAS BEEN POLITICS AND THE WAY WE SEE THE WORLD.
YOU1000000045_S0000235	I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED AS TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE... YOU ARE YOUR MOTHER'S DAUGHTER, YES,
YOU1000000045_S0000236	BUT YOU ARE YOUNGER THAN HER. ARE THERE EVER POLITICAL IDEAS OR, YOU KNOW, CONVERSATIONS YOU HAVE WHERE YOU DON'T AGREE OR YOU'VE CHANGED HOW YOU SEE AN IDEA BECAUSE OF YOUR AGE DIFFERENCE?
YOU1000000045_S0000237	YES.
YOU1000000045_S0000238	YES, ABSOLUTELY. I THINK MOST NOTABLY ON GAY MARRIAGE AND EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS.
YOU1000000045_S0000239	WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EXTENSIVELY.
YOU1000000045_S0000240	WOW.
YOU1000000045_S0000241	THROUGHOUT YEARS AND
YOU1000000045_S0000242	I'M REALLY GRATEFUL AND PROUD OF MY MOM FOR HER SHIFT TO BEING JUST A DOGGED, DETERMINED, NOT ONLY SUPPORTER, BUT ADVOCATE FOR EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS.
YOU1000000045_S0000243	YOU WERE, LIKE, IN THE HOUSE, AND YOU WERE LIKE, MOM, GOTTA GET GAY RIGHTS GOING. COME ON.
YOU1000000045_S0000244	THAT'S LIKE A WEIRD FIGHT TO BE HAVING WITH YOUR MOM. I'M NOT... IT'S LIKE, I WAS LIKE, I WANT TO GO TO A PARTY, AND YOU WERE LIKE, MOM, GAY PEOPLE NEED TO GET MARRIED.
YOU1000000045_S0000245	GO TO YOUR ROOM, YOUNG LADY! THAT'S PRETTY WILD.
YOU1000000045_S0000247	I MEAN, WELL, YES, BUT HOPEFULLY IN A NICER TONE.
YOU1000000045_S0000248	BUT CHELSEA WAS, YOU KNOW, REALLY ONE OF THE STRONG VOICES ON BEHALF OF GAY MARRIAGE HERE IN NEW YORK.
YOU1000000045_S0000249	SHE GAVE LOTS OF SPEECHES. SHE WAS PART OF A GROUP OF LEADERS THAT WERE ADVOCATING FOR IT.
YOU1000000045_S0000250	AND, YOU KNOW, I REALLY RESPECT AND LISTEN TO HER ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
YOU1000000045_S0000251	AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH PASSION ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000045_S0000252	WELL, I'LL TELL YOU THIS. IT IS A BOOK OF GUTSY WOMEN WRITTEN BY TWO OF THE GUTSIEST. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING ON THE SHOW. WONDERFUL HAVING YOU HERE.
YOU1000000045_S0000253	THE BOOK OF WAXY WOMEN IS AVAILABLE NOW. SECRETARY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON AND CHELSEA CLINTON, EVERYBODY.
YOU1000000101_S0000001	THE FOLLOWING PRE RECORDED POLITICAL PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY TV FOR GOLDWATER MILLER ON BEHALF OF BARRY GOLDWATER, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000101_S0000002	LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE TAKE PRIDE IN PRESENTING A THOUGHTFUL ADDRESS BY RONALD REAGAN. MR. REAGAN.
YOU1000000101_S0000004	THANK YOU.
YOU1000000101_S0000006	THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU1000000101_S0000008	THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING. THE SPONSOR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED, BUT UNLIKE MOST TELEVISION PROGRAMS, THE PERFORMER HASN'T BEEN PROVIDED WITH A SCRIPT.
YOU1000000101_S0000009	AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO CHOOSE MY OWN WORDS AND DISCUSS MY OWN IDEAS REGARDING THE CHOICE THAT WE FACE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.
YOU1000000101_S0000010	I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE AS A DEMOCRAT. I RECENTLY HAVE SEEN FIT TO FOLLOW ANOTHER COURSE.
YOU1000000101_S0000011	I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUES CONFRONTING US CROSS PARTY LINES.
YOU1000000101_S0000013	NOW, ONE SIDE IN THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN TELLING US THAT THE ISSUES OF THIS ELECTION ARE THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY. THE LINE HAS BEEN USED. WE'VE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.
YOU1000000101_S0000014	BUT I HAVE AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THIS PROSPERITY ISN'T SOMETHING ON WHICH WE CAN BASE OUR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE.
YOU1000000101_S0000015	NO NATION IN HISTORY HAS EVER SURVIVED A TAX BURDEN THAT REACHED A THIRD OF ITS NATIONAL INCOME.
YOU1000000101_S0000016	TODAY, 37 CENTS OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR EARNED IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE TAX COLLECTOR'S SHARE.
YOU1000000101_S0000017	AND YET OUR GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SPEND $17 MILLION A DAY MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT TAKES IN.
YOU1000000101_S0000018	WE HAVEN'T BALANCED OUR BUDGET 28 OUT OF THE LAST 34 YEARS. WE'VE RAISED OUR DEBT LIMIT THREE TIMES IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
YOU1000000101_S0000019	AND NOW OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS ONE AND A HALF TIMES BIGGER THAN ALL THE COMBINED DEBTS OF ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD.
YOU1000000101_S0000020	WE HAVE 15 BILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD IN OUR TREASURY. WE DON'T OWN AN OUNCE. FOREIGN DOLLAR CLAIMS ARE 27.3 BILLION DOLLARS.
YOU1000000101_S0000021	AND WE'VE JUST HAD ANNOUNCED THAT THE DOLLAR OF 1939 WILL NOW PURCHASE 45 CENTS IN ITS TOTAL VALUE.
YOU1000000101_S0000022	AS FOR THE PEACE THAT WE WOULD PRESERVE...
YOU1000000101_S0000023	I WONDER WHO AMONG US WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH THE WIFE OR MOTHER WHOSE HUSBAND OR SON HAS DIED IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND ASK THEM IF THEY THINK THIS IS A PEACE.
YOU1000000101_S0000024	THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED INDEFINITELY. DO THEY MEAN PEACE OR DO THEY MEAN WE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT IN PEACE?
YOU1000000101_S0000025	THERE CAN BE NO REAL PEACE WHILE ONE AMERICAN IS DYING SOMEPLACE IN THE WORLD FOR THE REST OF US.
YOU1000000101_S0000026	WE'RE AT WAR WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY THAT HAS EVER FACED MANKIND IN HIS LONG CLIMB FROM THE SWAMP TO THE STARS.
YOU1000000101_S0000027	AND IT'S BEEN SAID IF WE LOSE THAT WAR AND IN SO DOING LOSE THIS WAY OF FREEDOM OF OURS,
YOU1000000101_S0000028	HISTORY WILL RECORD WITH THE GREATEST ASTONISHMENT THAT THOSE WHO HAD THE MOST TO LOSE DID THE LEAST TO PREVENT ITS HAPPENING.
YOU1000000101_S0000029	WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME WE ASK OURSELVES IF WE STILL KNOW THE FREEDOMS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR US BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS.
YOU1000000101_S0000030	NOT TOO LONG AGO, TWO FRIENDS OF MINE WERE TALKING TO A CUBAN REFUGEE, A BUSINESSMAN WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM CASTRO.
YOU1000000101_S0000031	AND IN THE MIDST OF HIS STORY, ONE OF MY FRIENDS TURNED TO THE OTHER AND SAID, WE DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY WE ARE. AND THE CUBAN STOPPED AND SAID, HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.
YOU1000000101_S0000032	I HAD SOME PLACE TO ESCAPE TO. AND IN THAT SENTENCE HE TOLD US THE ENTIRE STORY.
YOU1000000101_S0000033	IF WE LOSE FREEDOM HERE, THERE'S NO PLACE TO ESCAPE TO. THIS IS THE LAST STAND ON EARTH.
YOU1000000101_S0000034	AND THIS IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT IS BEHOLDEN TO THE PEOPLE, THAT IT HAS NO OTHER SOURCE OF POWER EXCEPT THE SOVEREIGN PEOPLE.
YOU1000000101_S0000035	IS STILL THE NEWEST AND THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA IN ALL THE LONG HISTORY OF MAN'S RELATION TO MAN.
YOU1000000101_S0000036	THIS IS THE ISSUE OF THIS ELECTION.
YOU1000000101_S0000037	WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN OUR CAPACITY FOR SELF GOVERNMENT OR WHETHER WE ABANDON THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
YOU1000000101_S0000038	AND CONFESS THAT A LITTLE INTELLECTUAL ELITE IN A FAR DISTANT CAPITAL CAN PLAN OUR LIVES FOR US BETTER THAN WE CAN PLAN THEM OURSELVES.
YOU1000000101_S0000039	YOU AND I ARE TOLD INCREASINGLY WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A LEFT OR RIGHT. WELL, I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A LEFT OR RIGHT.
YOU1000000101_S0000040	THERE'S ONLY AN UP OR DOWN.
YOU1000000101_S0000042	MAN'S OLD AGE DREAM, THE ULTIMATE IN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM CONSISTENT WITH LAW AND ORDER, OR DOWN TO THE ANT HEAP OF TOTALITARIANISM.
YOU1000000101_S0000043	AND REGARDLESS OF THEIR SINCERITY, THEIR HUMANITARIAN MOTIVES, THOSE WHO WOULD TRADE OUR FREEDOM FOR SECURITY HAVE EMBARKED ON THIS DOWNWARD COURSE.
YOU1000000101_S0000044	IN THIS BOAT HARVESTING TIME, THEY USE TERMS LIKE THE GREAT SOCIETY.
YOU1000000101_S0000045	OR, AS WE WERE TOLD A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE PRESIDENT, WE MUST ACCEPT A GREATER GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE PEOPLE.
YOU1000000101_S0000046	BUT THEY'VE BEEN A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT IN THE PAST AND AMONG THEMSELVES AND ALL OF THE THINGS I NOW WILL QUOTE HAVE APPEARED IN PRINT
YOU1000000101_S0000047	THESE ARE NOT REPUBLICAN ACCUSATIONS.
YOU1000000101_S0000048	FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE VOICES THAT SAY THE COLD WAR WILL END THROUGH OUR ACCEPTANCE OF A NOT UNDEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM.
YOU1000000101_S0000049	ANOTHER VOICE SAYS THE PROFIT MOTIVE HAS BECOME OUTMODED. IT MUST BE REPLACED BY THE INCENTIVES OF THE WELFARE STATE.
YOU1000000101_S0000050	OR OUR TRADITIONAL SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IS INCAPABLE OF SOLVING THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF THE 20TH CENTURY.
YOU1000000101_S0000051	SENATOR FULBRIGHT HAS SAID AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS OUTMODED.
YOU1000000101_S0000052	HE REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT AS OUR MORAL TEACHER AND OUR LEADER.
YOU1000000101_S0000054	AND HE SAYS HE IS HOBBLED IN HIS TASK BY THE RESTRICTIONS OF POWER IMPOSED ON HIM BY THIS ANTIQUATED DOCUMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000055	HE MUST BE FREED SO THAT HE CAN DO FOR US WHAT HE KNOWS IS BEST.
YOU1000000101_S0000056	AND SENATOR CLARK OF PENNSYLVANIA, ANOTHER ARTICULATE SPOKESMAN, DEFINES LIBERALISM AS MEETING THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF THE MASSES THROUGH THE FULL POWER OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000057	WELL, I FOR ONE RESENTED WHEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE REFERS TO YOU AND ME, THE FREE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY, AS THE MASSES.
YOU1000000101_S0000058	THIS IS A TERM WE HAVEN'T APPLIED TO OURSELVES IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000101_S0000059	BUT BEYOND THAT, THE FULL POWER OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT. THIS WAS THE VERY THING THE FOUNDING FATHERS SOUGHT TO MINIMIZE.
YOU1000000101_S0000060	THEY KNEW THAT GOVERNMENTS DON'T CONTROL THINGS. A GOVERNMENT CAN'T CONTROL THE ECONOMY WITHOUT CONTROLLING PEOPLE.
YOU1000000101_S0000061	AND THEY KNOW WHEN A GOVERNMENT SETS OUT TO DO THAT, IT MUST USE FORCE AND COERCION TO ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSE.
YOU1000000101_S0000062	THEY ALSO KNEW THOSE FOUNDING FATHERS THAT OUTSIDE OF ITS LEGITIMATE FUNCTIONS, GOVERNMENT DOES NOTHING AS WELL OR AS ECONOMICALLY AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000101_S0000063	NOW WE HAVE NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS THAN GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE FARM ECONOMY OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS.
YOU1000000101_S0000064	SINCE 1955, THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM HAS NEARLY DOUBLED. ONE FOURTH OF FARMING IN AMERICA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 85% OF THE FARM SURPLUS.
YOU1000000101_S0000065	THREE FOURTHS OF FARMING IS OUT ON THE FREE MARKET AND HAS KNOWN A 21% INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF ALL ITS PRODUCE.
YOU1000000101_S0000066	YOU SEE, THAT ONE FOURTH OF FARMING, THAT'S REGULATED AND CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000067	IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, WE'VE SPENT $43 IN THE FEED GRAIN PROGRAM FOR EVERY DOLLAR BUSHEL OF CORN WE DON'T GROW.
YOU1000000101_S0000068	SENATOR HUMPHREY LAST WEEK CHARGED THAT BARRY GOLDWATER AS PRESIDENT WOULD SEEK TO ELIMINATE FARMERS. HE SHOULD DO HIS HOMEWORK A LITTLE BETTER.
YOU1000000101_S0000069	BECAUSE HE'LL FIND OUT THAT WE'VE HAD A DECLINE OF FIVE MILLION IN THE FARM POPULATION UNDER THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.
YOU1000000101_S0000070	HE'LL ALSO FIND THAT THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION HAS SOUGHT TO GET FROM CONGRESS
YOU1000000101_S0000071	EXTENSION OF THE FARM PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THAT THREE FOURTHS THAT IS NOW FREE.
YOU1000000101_S0000072	YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY'VE ALSO ASKED FOR THE RIGHT TO IMPRISON FARMERS WHO WOULDN'T KEEP BOOKS AS PRESCRIBED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000073	THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE ASKED FOR THE RIGHT TO SEIZE FARMS THROUGH CONDEMNATION AND RESELL THEM TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS.
YOU1000000101_S0000074	AND CONTAINED IN THAT SAME PROGRAM WAS A PROVISION THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE TWO MILLION FARMERS FROM THE SOIL.
YOU1000000101_S0000075	AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES. THERE'S NOW ONE FOR EVERY 30 FARMS IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000101_S0000076	AND STILL THEY CAN'T TELL US HOW 66 SHIPLOADS OF GRAIN HEADED FOR AUSTRIA DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE AND BILLY SOLIS JUST NEVER LEFT SHORE.
YOU1000000101_S0000078	EVERY RESPONSIBLE FARMER AND FARM ORGANIZATION HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO FREE THE FARM ECONOMY.
YOU1000000101_S0000079	BUT HOW, WHO ARE FARMERS TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM?
YOU1000000101_S0000080	THE WHEAT FARMERS VOTED AGAINST A WHEAT PROGRAM. THE GOVERNMENT PASSED IT ANYWAY. NOW THE PRICE OF BREAD GOES UP, THE PRICE OF WHEAT TO THE FARMER GOES DOWN.
YOU1000000101_S0000081	MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE CITY, UNDER URBAN RENEWAL, THE ASSAULT ON FREEDOM CARRIES ON.
YOU1000000101_S0000083	PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS SO DILUTED THAT PUBLIC INTEREST IS ALMOST ANYTHING A FEW GOVERNMENT PLANNERS DECIDE IT SHOULD BE. IN A PROGRAM THAT TAKES FROM THE NEEDY AND GIVES TO THE GREEDY.
YOU1000000101_S0000084	WE SEE SUCH SPECTACLES AS IN CLEVELAND, OHIO. A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLAR BUILDING COMPLETED ONLY THREE YEARS AGO MUST BE DESTROYED.
YOU1000000101_S0000085	TO MAKE WAY FOR WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CALL A MORE COMPATIBLE USE OF THE LAND.
YOU1000000101_S0000086	THE PRESIDENT TELLS US HE'S NOW GOING TO START BUILDING PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS IN THE THOUSANDS. WE'RE HERETOFORE, WE'VE ONLY BUILT THEM IN THE HUNDREDS.
YOU1000000101_S0000087	BUT FHA AND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION TELL US THEY HAVE 120,000 HOUSING UNITS THEY'VE TAKEN BACK THROUGH MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE.
YOU1000000101_S0000088	FOR THREE DECADES, WE'VE SOUGHT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF UNEMPLOYMENT THROUGH GOVERNMENT PLANNING, AND THE MORE THE PLANS FAIL, THE MORE THE PLANNERS PLAN.
YOU1000000101_S0000089	THE LATEST IS THE AREA REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY.
YOU1000000101_S0000090	THEY'VE JUST DECLARED RICE COUNTY, KANSAS A DEPRESSED AREA.
YOU1000000101_S0000091	RICE COUNTY, KANSAS HAS 200 OIL WELLS AND THE 14,000 PEOPLE THERE HAVE OVER $30 MILLION ON DEPOSIT IN PERSONAL SAVINGS IN THEIR BANKS.
YOU1000000101_S0000093	WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TELLS YOU YOU'RE DEPRESSED, LIE DOWN AND BE DEPRESSED.
YOU1000000101_S0000094	WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SEE A FAT MAN STANDING BESIDE A THIN ONE WITHOUT COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THE FAT MAN GOT THAT WAY BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THIN ONE
YOU1000000101_S0000095	SO THEY'RE GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS OF HUMAN MISERY THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT PLANNING.
YOU1000000101_S0000096	WELL, NOW, IF GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND WELFARE HAD THE ANSWER...
YOU1000000101_S0000097	AND THEY'VE HAD ALMOST 30 YEARS OF IT, SHOULDN'T WE EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO READ THE SCORE TO US ONCE IN A WHILE?
YOU1000000101_S0000098	SHOULDN'T THEY BE TELLING US ABOUT THE DECLINE EACH YEAR IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NEEDING HELP?
YOU1000000101_S0000099	THE REDUCTION IN THE NEED FOR PUBLIC HOUSING? BUT THE REVERSE IS TRUE. EACH YEAR THE NEED GROWS GREATER, THE PROGRAM GROWS GREATER.
YOU1000000101_S0000101	WE WERE TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO THAT 17 MILLION PEOPLE WENT TO BED HUNGRY EACH NIGHT. WELL, THAT WAS PROBABLY TRUE. THEY WERE ALL ON A DIET.
YOU1000000101_S0000104	BUT NOW WE'RE TOLD THAT 9.3 MILLION FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE POVERTY STRICKEN ON THE BASIS OF EARNING LESS THAN $3,000 A YEAR.
YOU1000000101_S0000105	WELFARE SPENDING 10 TIMES GREATER THAN IT WAS IN THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE DEPRESSION.
YOU1000000101_S0000106	WE'RE SPENDING $45 BILLION ON WELFARE.
YOU1000000101_S0000107	NOW DO A LITTLE ARITHMETIC AND YOU'LL FIND THAT IF WE DIVIDED THE 45 BILLION DOLLARS UP EQUALLY AMONG THOSE 9 MILLION POOR FAMILIES...
YOU1000000101_S0000108	WE'D BE ABLE TO GIVE EACH FAMILY $4,600 A YEAR. AND THIS ADDED TO THEIR PRESENT INCOME SHOULD ELIMINATE POVERTY.
YOU1000000101_S0000110	DIRECT AID TO THE POOR, HOWEVER, IS ONLY RUNNING ABOUT $600 PER FAMILY. IT WOULD SEEM THAT SOMEPLACE THERE MUST BE SOME OVERHEAD.
YOU1000000101_S0000112	NOW...
YOU1000000101_S0000114	SO NOW WE DECLARE WAR ON POVERTY OR YOU TOO CAN BE A BOBBY BAKER.
YOU1000000101_S0000116	NOW DO THEY HONESTLY EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THAT IF WE ADD ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE 45 BILLION WE'RE SPENDING, ONE MORE PROGRAM TO THE 30 ODD WE HAVE,
YOU1000000101_S0000117	AND REMEMBER, THIS NEW PROGRAM DOESN'T REPLACE ANY. IT JUST DUPLICATES EXISTING PROGRAMS. DO THEY BELIEVE THAT POVERTY IS SUDDENLY GOING TO DISAPPEAR BY MAGIC?
YOU1000000101_S0000118	WELL, IN ALL FAIRNESS, I SHOULD EXPLAIN THERE IS ONE PART OF THE NEW PROGRAM THAT ISN'T DUPLICATED. THIS IS THE YOUTH FEATURE. WE'RE NOW GOING TO SOLVE THE DROPOUT PROBLEM, JUVENILE DELINQUENCY.
YOU1000000101_S0000119	BY REINSTITUTING SOMETHING LIKE THE OLD CCC CAMPS. AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THESE CAMPS.
YOU1000000101_S0000120	BUT AGAIN, WE DO SOME ARITHMETIC AND WE FIND THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND EACH YEAR, JUST ON ROOM AND BOARD FOR EACH YOUNG PERSON WE HELP, $4,700 A YEAR.
YOU1000000101_S0000121	WE CAN SEND THEM TO HARVARD FOR $2,700.
YOU1000000101_S0000123	OF COURSE, DON'T GET ME WRONG. I'M NOT SUGGESTING HARVARD IS THE ANSWER TO JUVENILE DELINQUENCY.
YOU1000000101_S0000125	BUT SERIOUSLY, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO THOSE WE SEEK TO HELP?
YOU1000000101_S0000127	NOT TOO LONG AGO, A JUDGE CALLED ME HERE IN LOS ANGELES.
YOU1000000101_S0000128	HE TOLD ME OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO'D COME BEFORE HIM FOR A DIVORCE.
YOU1000000101_S0000129	SHE HAD SIX CHILDREN, WAS PREGNANT WITH HER SEVENTH. UNDER HIS QUESTIONING, SHE REVEALED HER HUSBAND WAS A LABORER EARNING $250 A MONTH.
YOU1000000101_S0000130	SHE WANTED A DIVORCE TO GET AN $80 RAISE. SHE'S ELIGIBLE FOR $330 A MONTH IN THE AID TO DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROGRAM.
YOU1000000101_S0000131	SHE GOT THE IDEA FROM TWO WOMEN IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD WHO'D ALREADY DONE THAT VERY THING.
YOU1000000101_S0000132	YET ANYTIME YOU AND I QUESTION THE SCHEMES OF THE DO GOODERS, WE'RE DENOUNCED AS BEING AGAINST THEIR HUMANITARIAN GOALS. THEY SAY WE'RE ALWAYS AGAINST THINGS, WE'RE NEVER FOR ANYTHING.
YOU1000000101_S0000133	WELL, THE TROUBLE WITH OUR LIBERAL FRIENDS IS NOT THAT THEY'RE IGNORANT. IT'S JUST THAT THEY KNOW SO MUCH THAT ISN'T SO. NOW...
YOU1000000101_S0000135	WE'RE FOR A PROVISION THAT DESTITUTION SHOULD NOT FOLLOW UNEMPLOYMENT BY REASON OF OLD AGE. AND TO THAT END, WE HAVE ACCEPTED SOCIAL SECURITY AS A STEP TOWARD MEETING THE PROBLEM.
YOU1000000101_S0000136	BUT WE'RE AGAINST THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THIS PROGRAM WHEN THEY PRACTICE DECEPTION REGARDING ITS FISCAL SHORTCOMINGS.
YOU1000000101_S0000137	WHEN THEY CHARGE THAT ANY CRITICISM OF THE PROGRAM MEANS THAT WE WANT TO END PAYMENTS TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON THEM FOR A LIVELIHOOD.
YOU1000000101_S0000138	THEY'VE CALLED IT INSURANCE TO US IN A HUNDRED MILLION PIECES OF LITERATURE. BUT THEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND THEY TESTIFIED IT WAS A WELFARE PROGRAM.
YOU1000000101_S0000139	THEY ONLY USE THE TERM INSURANCE TO SELL IT TO THE PEOPLE. AND THEY SAID SOCIAL SECURITY DUES ARE A TAX FOR THE GENERAL USE OF THE GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000140	AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED THAT TAX. THERE IS NO FUND. BECAUSE ROBERT BYERS, THE ACTUARIAL HEAD, APPEARED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE...
YOU1000000101_S0000141	AND ADMITTED THAT SOCIAL SECURITY AS OF THIS MOMENT IS $298 BILLION IN THE HOLE.
YOU1000000101_S0000142	BUT HE SAID THERE SHOULD BE NO CAUSE FOR WORRY BECAUSE AS LONG AS THEY HAD THE POWER TO TAX THEY COULD ALWAYS TAKE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHATEVER THEY NEEDED TO BAIL THEM OUT OF TROUBLE
YOU1000000101_S0000143	AND THEY'RE DOING JUST THAT. A YOUNG MAN, 21 YEARS OF AGE, WORKING AT AN AVERAGE SALARY.
YOU1000000101_S0000144	HIS SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION WOULD, IN THE OPEN MARKET, BUY HIM AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT WOULD GUARANTEE $220 A MONTH.
YOU1000000101_S0000145	AT AGE 65, THE GOVERNMENT PROMISES 127. HE COULD LIVE IT UP UNTIL HE'S 31 AND THEN TAKE OUT A POLICY THAT WOULD PAY MORE THAN SOCIAL SECURITY.
YOU1000000101_S0000146	NOW, ARE WE SO LACKING IN BUSINESS SENSE THAT WE CAN'T PUT THIS PROGRAM ON A SOUND BASIS?
YOU1000000101_S0000147	SO THAT PEOPLE WHO DO REQUIRE THOSE PAYMENTS WILL FIND THEY CAN GET THEM WHEN THEY'RE DUE, THAT THE CUPBOARD ISN'T BARE. BARRY GOLDWATER THINKS WE CAN.
YOU1000000101_S0000148	AT THE SAME TIME, CAN'T WE INTRODUCE VOLUNTARY FEATURES THAT WOULD PERMIT A CITIZEN WHO CAN DO BETTER ON HIS OWN?
YOU1000000101_S0000149	TO BE EXCUSED UPON PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD MADE PROVISION FOR THE NON EARNING YEARS?
YOU1000000101_S0000150	SHOULD WE NOT ALLOW A WIDOW WITH CHILDREN TO WORK AND NOT LOSE THE BENEFITS SUPPOSEDLY PAID FOR BY HER DECEASED HUSBAND?
YOU1000000101_S0000151	SHOULDN'T YOU AND I BE ALLOWED TO DECLARE WHO OUR BENEFICIARIES WILL BE UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WHICH WE CANNOT DO?
YOU1000000101_S0000152	I THINK WE'RE FORETELLING OUR SENIOR CITIZENS THAT NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE DENIED MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDS.
YOU1000000101_S0000154	BUT I THINK WE'RE AGAINST FORCING ALL CITIZENS, REGARDLESS OF NEED, INTO A COMPULSORY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM.
YOU1000000101_S0000155	ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE SUCH EXAMPLES AS WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK WHEN FRANCE ADMITTED THAT THEIR MEDICARE PROGRAM IS NOW BANKRUPT. THEY'VE COME TO THE END OF THE ROAD.
YOU1000000101_S0000156	IN ADDITION, WAS BARRY GOLDWATER SO IRRESPONSIBLE WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT OUR GOVERNMENT GIVE UP ITS PROGRAM OF DELIBERATE PLANNED INFLATION?
YOU1000000101_S0000157	SO THAT WHEN YOU DO GET YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY PENSION, A DOLLAR WILL BUY A DOLLAR'S WORTH AND NOT 45 CENTS' WORTH?
YOU1000000101_S0000159	I THINK WE'RE FOR AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION WHERE THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD CAN SEEK PEACE.
YOU1000000101_S0000160	BUT I THINK WE'RE AGAINST SUBORDINATING AMERICAN INTERESTS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BECOME SO STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND.
YOU1000000101_S0000161	THAT TODAY YOU CAN MUSTER A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AMONG NATIONS THAT REPRESENT LESS THAN 10% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION.
YOU1000000101_S0000162	I THINK WE'RE AGAINST THE HYPOCRISY OF ASSAILING OUR ALLIES BECAUSE HERE AND THERE THEY CLING TO A COLONY.
YOU1000000101_S0000163	WHILE WE ENGAGE IN A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE AND NEVER OPEN OUR MOUTHS ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ENSLAVED IN THE SOVIET COLONIES IN THE SATELLITE NATIONS.
YOU1000000101_S0000165	I THINK WE'RE FOR AIDING OUR ALLIES BY SHARING OF OUR MATERIAL BLESSINGS WITH THOSE NATIONS WHICH SHARE IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS.
YOU1000000101_S0000166	BUT WE'RE AGAINST DOLING OUT MONEY GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT, CREATING BUREAUCRACY, IF NOT SOCIALISM, ALL OVER THE WORLD.
YOU1000000101_S0000167	WE SET OUT TO HELP 19 COUNTRIES. WE'RE HELPING 107. WE'VE SPENT $146 BILLION.
YOU1000000101_S0000168	WITH THAT MONEY, WE BOUGHT A $2 MILLION YACHT FOR HAILE SELASSIE. WE BOUGHT DRESS SUITS FOR GREEK UNDERTAKERS, EXTRA WIVES FOR KENYA GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
YOU1000000101_S0000169	WE BOUGHT A THOUSAND TV SETS FOR A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE NO ELECTRICITY.
YOU1000000101_S0000171	IN THE LAST SIX YEARS, 52 NATIONS HAVE BOUGHT $7 BILLION WORTH OF OUR GOLD, AND ALL 52 ARE RECEIVING FOREIGN AID FROM THIS COUNTRY.
YOU1000000101_S0000173	NO GOVERNMENT EVER VOLUNTARILY REDUCES ITSELF IN SIZE. SO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ONCE LAUNCHED NEVER DISAPPEAR.
YOU1000000101_S0000174	ACTUALLY, A GOVERNMENT BUREAU IS THE NEAREST THING TO ETERNAL LIFE WE'LL EVER SEE ON THIS EARTH.
YOU1000000101_S0000176	FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, FEDERAL EMPLOYEES NUMBER TWO AND A HALF MILLION, AND FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL, ONE OUT OF SIX OF THE NATION'S WORKFORCE EMPLOYED BY GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000177	THESE PROLIFERATING BUREAUS WITH THEIR THOUSANDS OF REGULATIONS HAVE COST US MANY OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS.
YOU1000000101_S0000178	HOW MANY OF US REALIZE THAT TODAY FEDERAL AGENTS CAN INVADE A MAN'S PROPERTY WITHOUT A WARRANT? THEY CAN IMPOSE A FINE WITHOUT A FORMAL HEARING, LET ALONE A TRIAL BY JURY?
YOU1000000101_S0000179	AND THEY CAN SEIZE AND SELL HIS PROPERTY AT AUCTION TO ENFORCE THE PAYMENT OF THAT FINE.
YOU1000000101_S0000180	IN CHICO COUNTY, ARKANSAS, JAMES WEIR OVERPLANTED HIS RICE ALLOTMENT. THE GOVERNMENT OBTAINED A $17,000 JUDGMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000181	AND A US MARSHAL SOLD HIS 960 ACRE FARM AT AUCTION. THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS NECESSARY AS A WARNING TO OTHERS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK.
YOU1000000101_S0000183	LAST FEBRUARY 19TH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, NORMAN THOMAS, SIX TIMES CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ON THE SOCIALIST PARTY TICKET, SAID, IF BARRY GOLDWATER BECAME PRESIDENT...
YOU1000000101_S0000184	HE WOULD STOP THE ADVANCE OF SOCIALISM IN THE UNITED STATES. I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WILL DO.
YOU1000000101_S0000186	BUT AS A FORMER DEMOCRAT, I CAN TELL YOU NORMAN THOMAS ISN'T THE ONLY MAN WHO HAS DRAWN THIS PARALLEL TO SOCIALISM WITH THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION.
YOU1000000101_S0000187	BECAUSE BACK IN 1936, MR. DEMOCRAT HIMSELF, AL SMITH, A GREAT AMERICAN, CAME BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
YOU1000000101_S0000188	AND CHARGED THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS PARTY WAS TAKING THE PARTY OF JEFFERSON, JACKSON, AND CLEVELAND DOWN THE ROAD UNDER THE BANNERS OF MARX, LENIN, AND STALIN.
YOU1000000101_S0000189	AND HE WALKED AWAY FROM HIS PARTY AND HE NEVER RETURNED TILL THE DAY HE DIED.
YOU1000000101_S0000190	BECAUSE TO THIS DAY, THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN TAKING THAT PARTY, THAT HONORABLE PARTY, DOWN THE ROAD IN THE IMAGE OF THE LABOUR SOCIALIST PARTY OF ENGLAND.
YOU1000000101_S0000191	NOW, IT DOESN'T REQUIRE EXPROPRIATION OR CONFISCATION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY OR BUSINESS TO IMPOSE SOCIALISM ON A PEOPLE.
YOU1000000101_S0000192	WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHETHER YOU HOLD THE DEED TO THE, OR THE TITLE TO YOUR BUSINESS OR PROPERTY IF THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH?
YOU1000000101_S0000193	OVER THAT BUSINESS OR PROPERTY AND SUCH MACHINERY ALREADY EXISTS.
YOU1000000101_S0000194	THE GOVERNMENT CAN FIND SOME CHARGE TO BRING AGAINST ANY CONCERN IT CHOOSES TO PROSECUTE. EVERY BUSINESSMAN HAS HIS OWN TALE OF HARASSMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000195	SOMEWHERE A PERVERSION HAS TAKEN PLACE. OUR NATURAL, UNALIENABLE RIGHTS ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE A DISPENSATION OF GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000196	AND FREEDOM HAS NEVER BEEN SO FRAGILE, SO CLOSE TO SLIPPING FROM OUR GRASP AS IT IS AT THIS MOMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000197	OUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS SEEM UNWILLING TO DEBATE THESE ISSUES. THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CONTEST BETWEEN TWO MEN.
YOU1000000101_S0000198	THAT WERE TO CHOOSE JUST BETWEEN TWO PERSONALITIES, WELL, WHAT OF THIS MAN THAT THEY WOULD DESTROY?
YOU1000000101_S0000199	AND IN DESTROYING, THEY WOULD DESTROY THAT WHICH HE REPRESENTS, THE IDEAS THAT YOU AND I HOLD DEAR.
YOU1000000101_S0000201	IS HE THE BRASH AND SHALLOW AND TRIGGER HAPPY MAN THEY SAY HE IS?
YOU1000000101_S0000202	WELL, I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO KNOW HIM WHEN. I KNEW HIM LONG BEFORE HE EVER DREAMED OF TRYING FOR HIGH OFFICE.
YOU1000000101_S0000203	AND I CAN TELL YOU PERSONALLY, I'VE NEVER KNOWN A MAN IN MY LIFE I BELIEVED SO INCAPABLE OF DOING A DISHONEST OR DISHONORABLE THING.
YOU1000000101_S0000205	THIS IS A MAN WHO IN HIS OWN BUSINESS BEFORE HE ENTERED POLITICS INSTITUTED A PROFIT SHARING PLAN BEFORE UNIONS HAD EVER THOUGHT OF IT.
YOU1000000101_S0000206	HE PUT IN HEALTH AND MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR ALL HIS EMPLOYEES. HE TOOK 50% OF THE PROFITS BEFORE TAXES.
YOU1000000101_S0000207	AND SET UP A RETIREMENT PROGRAM, A PENSION PLAN FOR ALL HIS EMPLOYEES.
YOU1000000101_S0000208	HE SENT MONTHLY CHECKS FOR LIFE TO AN EMPLOYEE WHO WAS ILL AND COULDN'T WORK. HE PROVIDES NURSING CARE FOR THE CHILDREN OF MOTHERS WHO WORK IN THE STORES.
YOU1000000101_S0000210	WHEN MEXICO WAS RAVAGED BY THE FLOODS IN THE RIO GRANDE, HE CLIMBED IN HIS AIRPLANE AND FLEW MEDICINE AND SUPPLIES DOWN THERE.
YOU1000000101_S0000211	AN EX GI TOLD ME HOW HE MET HIM.
YOU1000000101_S0000212	IT WAS THE WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS DURING THE KOREAN WAR AND HE WAS AT THE LOS ANGELES AIRPORT TRYING TO GET A RIDE HOME TO ARIZONA FOR CHRISTMAS
YOU1000000101_S0000214	AND HE SAID THAT A LOT OF SERVICEMEN THERE AND NO SEATS AVAILABLE ON THE PLANES.
YOU1000000101_S0000215	AND THEN A VOICE CAME OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER AND SAID, ANY MEN IN UNIFORM WANTING A RIDE TO ARIZONA, GO TO RUNWAY SUCH AND SUCH.
YOU1000000101_S0000216	AND THEY WENT DOWN THERE, THERE WAS A FELLOW NAMED BARRY GOLDWATER SITTING IN HIS PLANE.
YOU1000000101_S0000217	EVERY DAY IN THOSE WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, ALL DAY LONG, HE'D LOAD UP THE PLANE, FLY IT TO ARIZONA, FLY THEM TO THEIR HOMES, FLY BACK OVER TO GET ANOTHER LOAD.
YOU1000000101_S0000219	DURING THE HECTIC SPLIT SECOND TIMING OF A CAMPAIGN, THIS IS A MAN WHO TOOK TIME OUT TO SIT BESIDE AN OLD FRIEND WHO WAS DYING OF CANCER.
YOU1000000101_S0000220	HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGERS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY IMPATIENT, BUT HE SAID THERE AREN'T MANY LEFT WHO CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER. I'D LIKE HER TO KNOW I CARE.
YOU1000000101_S0000221	THIS IS A MAN WHO SAID TO HIS 19 YEAR OLD SON, THERE IS NO FOUNDATION LIKE THE ROCK OF HONESTY AND FAIRNESS.
YOU1000000101_S0000222	AND WHEN YOU BEGIN TO BUILD YOUR LIFE ON THAT ROCK, WITH THE CEMENT OF THE FAITH IN GOD THAT YOU HAVE, THEN YOU HAVE A REAL START.
YOU1000000101_S0000224	THIS IS NOT A MAN WHO COULD CARELESSLY SEND OTHER PEOPLE'S SONS TO WAR.
YOU1000000101_S0000226	AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF THIS CAMPAIGN THAT MAKES ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS I'VE DISCUSSED ACADEMIC, UNLESS WE REALIZE WE'RE IN A WAR THAT MUST BE WON.
YOU1000000101_S0000228	THOSE WHO WOULD TRADE OUR FREEDOM FOR THE SOUP KITCHEN OF THE WELFARE STATE HAVE TOLD US THEY HAVE A UTOPIAN SOLUTION OF PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY. THEY CALL THEIR POLICY ACCOMMODATION.
YOU1000000101_S0000229	AND THEY SAY IF WE'LL ONLY AVOID ANY DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE ENEMY, HE'LL FORGET HIS EVIL WAYS AND LEARN TO LOVE US.
YOU1000000101_S0000230	ALL WHO OPPOSE THEM ARE INDICTED AS WARMONGERS. THEY SAY WE OFFER SIMPLE ANSWERS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS.
YOU1000000101_S0000231	WELL, PERHAPS THERE IS A SIMPLE ANSWER. NOT AN EASY ANSWER, BUT SIMPLE. IF YOU AND I HAVE THE COURAGE TO TELL OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS...
YOU1000000101_S0000232	THAT WE WANT OUR NATIONAL POLICY BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS IS MORALLY RIGHT. WE CANNOT BUY OUR SECURITY, OUR FREEDOM FROM THE THREAT OF THE BOMB.
YOU1000000101_S0000234	BY COMMITTING AN IMMORALITY SO GREAT AS SAYING TO A BILLION HUMAN BEINGS NOW ENSLAVED BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN, GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS OF FREEDOM.
YOU1000000101_S0000235	BECAUSE TO SAVE OUR OWN SKINS, WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH YOUR SLAVE MASTERS.
YOU1000000101_S0000236	ALEXANDER HAMILTON SAID, A NATION WHICH CAN PREFER DISGRACE TO DANGER IS PREPARED FOR A MASTER AND DESERVES ONE.
YOU1000000101_S0000237	NOW LET'S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. THERE'S NO ARGUMENT OVER THE CHOICE BETWEEN PEACE AND WAR.
YOU1000000101_S0000238	BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE GUARANTEED WAY YOU CAN HAVE PEACE, AND YOU CAN HAVE IT IN THE NEXT SECOND. SURRENDER.
YOU1000000101_S0000239	ADMITTEDLY, THERE'S A RISK IN ANY COURSE WE FOLLOW OTHER THAN THIS, BUT EVERY LESSON OF HISTORY TELLS US THAT THE GREATER RISK LIES IN APPEASEMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000240	AND THIS IS THE SPECTER OUR WELL MEANING LIBERAL FRIENDS REFUSE TO FACE, THAT THEIR POLICY OF ACCOMMODATION IS APPEASEMENT.
YOU1000000101_S0000241	AND IT GIVES NO CHOICE BETWEEN PEACE AND WAR, ONLY BETWEEN FIGHT OR SURRENDER.
YOU1000000101_S0000242	IF WE CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE, CONTINUE TO BACK AND RETREAT, EVENTUALLY WE HAVE TO FACE THE FINAL DEMAND, THE ULTIMATUM. AND WHAT THEN?
YOU1000000101_S0000243	WHEN NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAS TOLD HIS PEOPLE, HE KNOWS WHAT OUR ANSWER WILL BE.
YOU1000000101_S0000244	HE HAS TOLD THEM THAT WE'RE RETREATING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE COLD WAR AND SOMEDAY, WHEN THE TIME COMES TO DELIVER THE FINAL ULTIMATUM,
YOU1000000101_S0000245	OUR SURRENDER WILL BE VOLUNTARY BECAUSE BY THAT TIME WE WILL HAVE BEEN WEAKENED FROM WITHIN SPIRITUALLY, MORALLY, AND ECONOMICALLY.
YOU1000000101_S0000246	HE BELIEVES THIS BECAUSE FROM OUR SIDE HE'S HEARD VOICES PLEADING FOR PEACE AT ANY PRICE, OR BETTER REVVED THAN DEAD.
YOU1000000101_S0000247	OR AS ONE COMMENTATOR PUT IT, HE'D RATHER LIVE ON HIS KNEES THAN DIE ON HIS FEET. AND THEREIN LIES THE ROAD TO WAR. BECAUSE THOSE VOICES DON'T SPEAK FOR THE REST OF US.
YOU1000000101_S0000248	YOU AND I KNOW AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS SO DEAR AND PEACE SO SWEET AS TO BE PURCHASED AT THE PRICE OF CHAINS AND SLAVERY.
YOU1000000101_S0000249	IF NOTHING IN LIFE IS WORTH DYING FOR, WHEN DID THIS BEGIN? JUST IN THE FACE OF THIS ENEMY? OR SHOULD MOSES HAVE TOLD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO LIVE IN SLAVERY UNDER THE PHARAOHS?
YOU1000000101_S0000251	SHOULD CHRIST HAVE REFUSED THE CROSS? SHOULD THE PATRIOTS AT CONCORD BRIDGE HAVE THROWN DOWN THEIR GUNS AND REFUSED TO FIRE THE SHOT HEARD ROUND THE WORLD?
YOU1000000101_S0000253	THE MARTYRS OF HISTORY WERE NOT FOOLS. AND OUR HONORED DEAD WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO STOP THE ADVANCE OF THE NAZIS DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN.
YOU1000000101_S0000255	WHERE THEN IS THE ROAD TO PEACE? WELL, IT'S A SIMPLE ANSWER AFTER ALL.
YOU1000000101_S0000256	YOU AND I HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY TO OUR ENEMIES, THERE IS A PRICE WE WILL NOT PAY. THERE IS A POINT BEYOND WHICH THEY MUST NOT ADVANCE.
YOU1000000101_S0000258	AND THIS...
YOU1000000101_S0000260	THIS IS THE MEANING IN THE PHRASE OF BARRY GOLDWATER, PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.
YOU1000000101_S0000261	WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID, THE DESTINY OF MAN IS NOT MEASURED BY MATERIAL COMPUTATIONS. WHEN GREAT FORCES ARE ON THE MOVE IN THE WORLD, WE LEARN WE'RE SPIRITS, NOT ANIMALS.
YOU1000000101_S0000262	AND HE SAID THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON IN TIME AND SPACE AND BEYOND TIME AND SPACE. WHICH, WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, SPELLS DUTY.
YOU1000000101_S0000263	YOU AND I HAVE A RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY. WE'LL PRESERVE FOR OUR CHILDREN THIS, THE LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH.
YOU1000000101_S0000264	OR WE'LL SENTENCE THEM TO TAKE THE LAST STEP INTO A THOUSAND YEARS OF DARKNESS.
YOU1000000101_S0000265	WE WILL KEEP IN MIND AND REMEMBER THAT BARRY GOLDWATER HAS FAITH IN US. HE HAS FAITH THAT YOU AND I HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE DIGNITY AND THE RIGHT.
YOU1000000101_S0000266	TO MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS AND DETERMINE OUR OWN DESTINY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU1000000101_S0000268	THANK YOU, RONNIE, FOR THIS VERY STIRRING SPEECH.
YOU1000000101_S0000270	I AM JOHN KILROY, NATIONAL CHAIRMAN, TV FOR GOLDWATER MILLER. I WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOU...
YOU1000000101_S0000272	I WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO TAKE PART IN THIS IMPORTANT PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BY CONTRIBUTING WHAT YOU CAN
YOU1000000101_S0000273	TO KEEP THE GOLDWATER CRUSADE ON THE AIR. SEND ONE, TEN, FIFTY DOLLARS
YOU1000000101_S0000274	OR ANY AMOUNT TO TV FOR GOLDWATER MILLER, BOX 80, LOS ANGELES 51. I REPEAT.
YOU1000000101_S0000276	TV, GOLDWATER MILLER, BOX 80, LOS ANGELES, 51.
YOU1000000101_S0000278	THE PRECEDING PRE RECORDED POLITICAL PROGRAM WAS PAID FOR BY TV FOR GOLDWATER MILLER ON BEHALF OF BARRY GOLDWATER, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000102_S0000001	THIS PROGRAM IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY STANFORD UNIVERSITY. PLEASE VISIT US AT STANFORD.EDU.
YOU1000000102_S0000003	IT NOW GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE THIS YEAR'S COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER, STEVE JOBS.
YOU1000000102_S0000005	THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CO FOUNDER OF APPLE AND PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS
YOU1000000102_S0000007	STANFORD UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED SINCE ITS FOUNDING BY A WILLINGNESS TO BE BOLD AND TO STRIKE OUT IN NEW DIRECTIONS.
YOU1000000102_S0000008	AND THIS IS A CHARACTERISTIC VERY MUCH SHARED BY TODAY'S SPEAKER. A PIONEER AND VISIONARY,
YOU1000000102_S0000009	FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES, HIS NAME AND THE COMPANIES HE HAS FOUNDED HAVE BEEN SYNONYMOUS WITH INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY.
YOU1000000102_S0000010	AS A YOUNG BOY GROWING UP IN LOS ALTOS, STEVE JOBS CAME OF AGE AT THE SAME TIME AS SILICON VALLEY.
YOU1000000102_S0000012	WHILE STILL IN SCHOOL, HE ATTENDED LECTURES INFORMALLY AT STANFORD AS WELL AS AT HEWLETT PACKARD, WHERE HE SPENT A SUMMER WORKING.
YOU1000000102_S0000013	AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL, HE LEFT CALIFORNIA TO ATTEND REED COLLEGE.
YOU1000000102_S0000014	A TREK THROUGH INDIA, AND A SHORT STINT AS A VIDEO GAME DESIGNER FOR ATARI FOLLOWED.
YOU1000000102_S0000016	SOON AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE VALLEY IN 1974,
YOU1000000102_S0000017	HE BECAME A REGULAR, ALONG WITH STEVE WOZNIAK, AT MEETINGS OF THE HOMEBREW COMPUTER CLUB.
YOU1000000102_S0000018	HELD AT THE STANFORD LINEAR ACCELERATOR CENTER. IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE TWO OF THEM HAD BUILT THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE APPLE I.
YOU1000000102_S0000019	THE APPLE 1 WAS VERY FAST AT THE TIME, READING AND WRITING 4 KILOBYTES IN ABOUT 20 SECONDS.
YOU1000000102_S0000021	ABOUT 20,000 TIMES SLOWER THAN WE DO SO TODAY.
YOU1000000102_S0000023	THE APPLE II WAS FASTER STILL, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, INTRODUCED COLOR MONITORS INTO THE HOME MARKET.
YOU1000000102_S0000024	IN THE MID 1980S, THE MACINTOSH BECAME THE FIRST TRULY USER FRIENDLY PERSONAL COMPUTER.
YOU1000000102_S0000025	YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT TO SET IT UP OR TO LOAD SOFTWARE.
YOU1000000102_S0000026	OR TO TRANSFER INFORMATION BETWEEN APPLICATIONS. AND THE MOUSE OFFERED POINT AND CLICK CONVENIENCE.
YOU1000000102_S0000027	AND OPEN THE DOOR TO COMPUTER LITERACY FOR EVERYONE.
YOU1000000102_S0000028	I STILL REMEMBER THE AMAZED FACES OF ONLOOKERS
YOU1000000102_S0000029	AS THEY SAW A COMPUTER THAT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PERSONAL COMPUTERS OF THAT DAY.
YOU1000000102_S0000031	STEVE ALSO CO FOUNDED PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS, WHICH HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE FILM INDUSTRY IN ITS SHORT HISTORY WITH BRILLIANT USE OF TECHNOLOGY.
YOU1000000102_S0000032	AND PRODUCED TWO ACADEMY AWARD WINNING FILMS, TOY STORY AND FINDING NEMO.
YOU1000000102_S0000034	SINCE HIS RETURN TO APPLE EIGHT YEARS AGO, STEVE HAS REINVENTED THE COMPANY ONCE AGAIN, EXTENDING ITS VISION TO MUSIC AND NEW DIGITAL MEDIA.
YOU1000000102_S0000035	IPOD AND ITUNES HAVE CHANGED THE WAY WE LISTEN TO, ORGANIZE, STORE AND PURCHASE OUR MUSIC.
YOU1000000102_S0000036	AND IN MY CASE, THE WAY I OFTEN READ BOOKS.
YOU1000000102_S0000037	NOW SONGS WE LOVE ARE JUST 99 CENTS AND A COMPLETELY LEGAL CLICK AWAY.
YOU1000000102_S0000039	IPHOTO AND IMOVIE REVOLUTIONIZED THE ABILITY OF CONSUMERS TO ORGANIZE, EDIT, AND DISPLAY DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO.
YOU1000000102_S0000040	PUTTING CAPABILITIES THAT ONCE COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INTO THE HANDS OF EVERY MAC USER.
YOU1000000102_S0000041	STEVE IS ALSO WIDELY RECOGNIZED FOR HIS ABILITY TO CREATE AN INNOVATIVE ENVIRONMENT INSIDE APPLE, AS WELL AS AN EXTERNAL COMPANY IMAGE THAT IS EQUALLY INNOVATIVE.
YOU1000000102_S0000042	JUST THINK ABOUT APPLE'S MARKETING CAMPAIGNS OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES. A PROMOTIONAL FLYER IN 1976
YOU1000000102_S0000043	SHOWED ISAAC NEWTON SITTING UNDER A TREE JUST AS AN APPLE WAS FALLING BY.
YOU1000000102_S0000044	WITH THE CATCHY EXHORTATION TO BITE B Y T E INTO AN APPLE.
YOU1000000102_S0000046	THERE WAS AN ICONIC SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL.
YOU1000000102_S0000048	TECHIE HUMOR.
YOU1000000102_S0000050	AN ICONIC SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL TELLING US THAT THE MACINTOSH WAS ON THE HORIZON.
YOU1000000102_S0000051	AND ASSURING US THAT WE WOULD SEE WHY 1984 WOULDN'T BE LIKE 1984.
YOU1000000102_S0000052	AND IN THE LATE 1990S, WE SAW BANNERS AND BILLBOARDS.
YOU1000000102_S0000053	FEATURING PABLO PICASSO, ALBERT EINSTEIN, MARTHA GRAHAM, AND MAHATMA GANDHI, ALL URGING US TO THINK DIFFERENT.
YOU1000000102_S0000055	STEVE JOBS UNDERSTANDS THAT CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION START BY THINKING DIFFERENTLY.
YOU1000000102_S0000057	HE HAS A DEEP ROOTED BELIEF IN THE POWER OF EDUCATION TO TRANSFORM LIVES, COUPLED WITH THE DESIRE TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
YOU1000000102_S0000059	FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF APPLE, HE WORKED TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH EDUCATORS AND GET COMPUTERS INTO SCHOOLS.
YOU1000000102_S0000061	FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES, HE AND HIS COMPANIES HAVE PROVIDED INVALUABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES.
YOU1000000102_S0000062	INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY TO INFORMATION FOR LEARNERS OF ALL AGES.
YOU1000000102_S0000064	MORE THAN 100 YEARS AGO, IN DESCRIBING HIS VISION FOR A NEW UNIVERSITY, LELAND STANFORD WROTE,
YOU1000000102_S0000065	THE IMAGINATION NEEDS TO BE CULTIVATED AND DEVELOPED TO ASSURE SUCCESS IN LIFE.
YOU1000000102_S0000067	STANFORD CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE WAS ONLY THE STARTING POINT FOR CREATION AND DISCOVERY.
YOU1000000102_S0000068	STEVE JOBS UNDERSTANDS THAT THE COMPUTER IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL IN A TECHNICAL SENSE.
YOU1000000102_S0000069	BUT THAT ITS TRUE POWER LIES IN THE ABILITY TO UNLEASH THE IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY OF THE USER.
YOU1000000102_S0000071	AS HE EXPLAINED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES IN A 1997 INTERVIEW, THE MACINTOSH TURNED OUT SO WELL.
YOU1000000102_S0000072	BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WORKING ON IT WERE MUSICIANS, ARTISTS, POETS, AND HISTORIANS.
YOU1000000102_S0000073	WHO ALSO HAPPEN TO BE EXCELLENT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS.
YOU1000000102_S0000075	AND LAST FALL, A BUSINESSWEEK REPORTER ASKED HOW HE MANAGES FOR INNOVATION.
YOU1000000102_S0000076	HIS ANSWER WAS DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE. WE HIRE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000102_S0000078	STEVE JOBS PERSONIFIES THE SPIRIT AND CREATIVITY THAT HAVE CHARACTERIZED THIS UNIVERSITY SINCE ITS FOUNDING 114 YEARS AGO.
YOU1000000102_S0000079	AND WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE HIM HERE TODAY. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WARMLY WELCOMING THIS YEAR'S COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER, STEVE JOSS.
YOU1000000102_S0000081	I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY FOR YOUR COMMENCEMENT FROM ONE OF THE FINEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000102_S0000083	TRUTH BE TOLD.
YOU1000000102_S0000085	I NEVER GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER GOTTEN TO A COLLEGE GRADUATION.
YOU1000000102_S0000087	TODAY, I WANT TO TELL YOU THREE STORIES FROM MY LIFE. THAT'S IT. NO BIG DEAL. JUST THREE STORIES.
YOU1000000102_S0000089	THE FIRST STORY IS ABOUT CONNECTING THE DOTS.
YOU1000000102_S0000091	I DROPPED OUT OF REED COLLEGE AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, BUT THEN STAYED AROUND AS A DROP IN FOR ANOTHER 18 MONTHS OR SO BEFORE I REALLY QUIT.
YOU1000000102_S0000093	SO WHY'D I DROP OUT?
YOU1000000102_S0000095	IT STARTED BEFORE I WAS BORN.
YOU1000000102_S0000097	MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER WAS A YOUNG, UNWED GRADUATE STUDENT, AND SHE DECIDED TO PUT ME UP FOR ADOPTION.
YOU1000000102_S0000098	SHE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT I SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY COLLEGE GRADUATES, SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL SET FOR ME TO BE ADOPTED AT BIRTH BY A LAWYER AND HIS WIFE.
YOU1000000102_S0000100	EXCEPT THAT WHEN I POPPED OUT THEY DECIDED AT THE LAST MINUTE THAT THEY REALLY WANTED A GIRL
YOU1000000102_S0000102	SO MY PARENTS, WHO WERE ON A WAITING LIST, GOT A CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ASKING, WE'VE GOT AN UNEXPECTED BABY BOY. DO YOU WANT HIM?
YOU1000000102_S0000103	THEY SAID, OF COURSE.
YOU1000000102_S0000105	MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER FOUND OUT LATER THAT MY MOTHER HAD NEVER GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND THAT MY FATHER HAD NEVER GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
YOU1000000102_S0000106	SHE REFUSED TO SIGN THE FINAL ADOPTION PAPERS.
YOU1000000102_S0000108	SHE ONLY RELENTED A FEW MONTHS LATER WHEN MY PARENTS PROMISED THAT I WOULD GO TO COLLEGE. THIS WAS THE START IN MY LIFE.
YOU1000000102_S0000110	AND 17 YEARS LATER, I DID GO TO COLLEGE. BUT I NAIVELY CHOSE A COLLEGE THAT WAS ALMOST AS EXPENSIVE AS STANFORD.
YOU1000000102_S0000111	AND ALL OF MY WORKING CLASS PARENTS' SAVINGS WERE BEING SPENT ON MY COLLEGE TUITION. AFTER SIX MONTHS, I COULDN'T SEE THE VALUE IN IT.
YOU1000000102_S0000112	I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE AND NO IDEA HOW COLLEGE WAS GOING TO HELP ME FIGURE IT OUT.
YOU1000000102_S0000113	AND HERE I WAS, SPENDING ALL THE MONEY MY PARENTS HAD SAVED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE.
YOU1000000102_S0000115	SO I DECIDED TO DROP OUT AND TRUST THAT IT WOULD ALL WORK OUT OKAY. IT WAS PRETTY SCARY AT THE TIME, BUT LOOKING BACK, IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I EVER MADE.
YOU1000000102_S0000117	THE MINUTE I DROPPED OUT, I COULD STOP TAKING THE REQUIRED CLASSES THAT DIDN'T INTEREST ME AND BEGIN DROPPING IN ON THE ONES THAT LOOKED FAR MORE INTERESTING.
YOU1000000102_S0000119	IT WASN'T ALL ROMANTIC. I DIDN'T HAVE A DORM ROOM, SO I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR IN FRIENDS' ROOMS. I RETURNED COKE BOTTLES FOR THE FIVE CENT DEPOSITS TO BUY FOOD WITH.
YOU1000000102_S0000120	AND I WOULD WALK THE SEVEN MILES ACROSS TOWN EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT TO GET ONE GOOD MEAL A WEEK AT THE HARE KRISHNA TEMPLE.
YOU1000000102_S0000122	I LOVED IT. AND MUCH OF WHAT I STUMBLED INTO BY FOLLOWING MY CURIOSITY AND INTUITION TURNED OUT TO BE PRICELESS LATER ON. LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE.
YOU1000000102_S0000124	REED COLLEGE AT THAT TIME OFFERED PERHAPS THE BEST CALLIGRAPHY INSTRUCTION IN THE COUNTRY.
YOU1000000102_S0000125	THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS, EVERY POSTER, EVERY LABEL ON EVERY DRAWER WAS BEAUTIFULLY HAND CALLIGRAPHED. BECAUSE I HAD DROPPED OUT,
YOU1000000102_S0000126	AND DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE NORMAL CLASSES. I DECIDED TO TAKE A CALLIGRAPHY CLASS TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS. I LEARNED ABOUT SERIF AND SANS SERIF TYPEFACES
YOU1000000102_S0000127	ABOUT VARYING THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BETWEEN DIFFERENT LETTER COMBINATIONS, ABOUT WHAT MAKES GREAT TYPOGRAPHY GREAT.
YOU1000000102_S0000129	IT WAS BEAUTIFUL, HISTORICAL, ARTISTICALLY SUBTLE IN A WAY THAT SCIENCE CAN'T CAPTURE. AND I FOUND IT FASCINATING.
YOU1000000102_S0000131	NONE OF THIS HAD EVEN A HOPE OF ANY PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN MY LIFE.
YOU1000000102_S0000133	BUT TEN YEARS LATER, WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING THE FIRST MACINTOSH COMPUTER, IT ALL CAME BACK TO ME. AND WE DESIGNED IT ALL INTO THE MAC.
YOU1000000102_S0000134	IT WAS THE FIRST COMPUTER WITH BEAUTIFUL TYPOGRAPHY. IF I HAD NEVER DROPPED IN ON THAT SINGLE COURSE IN COLLEGE,
YOU1000000102_S0000135	THE MAC WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD MULTIPLE TYPEFACES OR PROPORTIONALLY SPACED FONTS. AND SINCE WINDOWS JUST COPIED THE MAC, IT'S LIKELY THAT NO PERSONAL COMPUTER WOULD HAVE THEM.
YOU1000000102_S0000137	IF I HAD NEVER DROPPED OUT, I WOULD HAVE NEVER DROPPED IN ON THAT CALLIGRAPHY CLASS, AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS MIGHT NOT HAVE THE WONDERFUL TYPOGRAPHY THAT THEY DO.
YOU1000000102_S0000138	OF COURSE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT THE DOTS LOOKING FORWARD WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, BUT IT WAS VERY, VERY CLEAR LOOKING BACKWARDS TEN YEARS LATER.
YOU1000000102_S0000139	AGAIN, YOU CAN'T CONNECT THE DOTS LOOKING FORWARD. YOU CAN ONLY CONNECT THEM LOOKING BACKWARDS. SO YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT THE DOTS WILL SOMEHOW CONNECT IN YOUR FUTURE.
YOU1000000102_S0000140	YOU HAVE TO TRUST IN SOMETHING, YOUR GUT, DESTINY, LIFE, KARMA, WHATEVER, BECAUSE BELIEVING THAT THE DOTS WILL CONNECT
YOU1000000102_S0000141	DOWN THE ROAD WILL GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART EVEN WHEN IT LEADS YOU OFF THE WELL WORN PATH AND THAT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
YOU1000000102_S0000143	MY SECOND STORY IS ABOUT LOVE AND LOSS.
YOU1000000102_S0000145	I WAS LUCKY. I FOUND WHAT I LOVE TO DO EARLY IN LIFE. WAZ AND I STARTED APPLE IN MY PARENTS' GARAGE WHEN I WAS 20. WE WORKED HARD.
YOU1000000102_S0000146	AND IN 10 YEARS, APPLE HAD GROWN FROM JUST THE TWO OF US IN A GARAGE INTO A $2 BILLION COMPANY WITH OVER 4,000 EMPLOYEES.
YOU1000000102_S0000147	WE JUST RELEASED OUR FINEST CREATION, THE MACINTOSH, A YEAR EARLIER, AND I JUST TURNED 30.
YOU1000000102_S0000149	AND THEN I GOT FIRED.
YOU1000000102_S0000151	HOW CAN YOU GET FIRED FROM A COMPANY YOU STARTED?
YOU1000000102_S0000153	WELL, AS APPLE GREW, WE HIRED SOMEONE WHO I THOUGHT WAS VERY TALENTED TO RUN THE COMPANY WITH ME. AND FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR SO, THINGS WENT WELL.
YOU1000000102_S0000154	BUT THEN OUR VISIONS OF THE FUTURE BEGAN TO DIVERGE, AND EVENTUALLY WE HAD A FALLING OUT. WHEN WE DID, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS SIDED WITH HIM. AND SO AT 30, I WAS OUT.
YOU1000000102_S0000155	AND VERY PUBLICLY OUT. WHAT HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE WAS GONE AND IT WAS DEVASTATING.
YOU1000000102_S0000157	I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR A FEW MONTHS. I FELT THAT I HAD LET THE PREVIOUS GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS DOWN, THAT I HAD DROPPED THE BATON AS IT WAS BEING PASSED TO ME.
YOU1000000102_S0000158	I MET WITH DAVID PACKARD AND BOB NOYCE AND TRIED TO APOLOGIZE FOR SCREWING UP SO BADLY.
YOU1000000102_S0000160	I WAS A VERY PUBLIC FAILURE AND I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE VALLEY. BUT SOMETHING SLOWLY BEGAN TO DAWN ON ME. I STILL LOVED WHAT I DID.
YOU1000000102_S0000162	THE TURN OF EVENTS AT APPLE HAD NOT CHANGED THAT ONE BIT. I'D BEEN REJECTED, BUT I WAS STILL IN LOVE.
YOU1000000102_S0000164	AND SO I DECIDED TO START OVER.
YOU1000000102_S0000166	I DIDN'T SEE IT THEN, BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT GETTING FIRED FROM APPLE WAS THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
YOU1000000102_S0000167	THE HEAVINESS OF BEING SUCCESSFUL WAS REPLACED BY THE LIGHTNESS OF BEING A BEGINNER AGAIN, LESS SURE ABOUT EVERYTHING. IT FREED ME TO ENTER ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVE PERIODS OF MY LIFE.
YOU1000000102_S0000168	DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, I STARTED A COMPANY NAMED NEXT, ANOTHER COMPANY NAMED PIXAR, AND FELL IN LOVE WITH AN AMAZING WOMAN WHO WOULD BECOME MY WIFE.
YOU1000000102_S0000169	PIXAR WENT ON TO CREATE THE WORLD'S FIRST COMPUTER ANIMATED FEATURE FILM, TOY STORY, AND IS NOW THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ANIMATION STUDIO IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000102_S0000171	IN A REMARKABLE TURN OF EVENTS, APPLE BOUGHT NEXT, AND I RETURNED TO APPLE, AND THE TECHNOLOGY WE DEVELOPED AT NEXT IS AT THE HEART OF APPLE'S CURRENT RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000102_S0000172	AND LORENE AND I HAVE A WONDERFUL FAMILY TOGETHER.
YOU1000000102_S0000174	I'M PRETTY SURE NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HADN'T BEEN FIRED FROM APPLE. IT WAS AWFUL TASTING MEDICINE, BUT I GUESS THE PATIENT NEEDED IT.
YOU1000000102_S0000176	SOMETIMES LIFE'S GOING TO HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WITH A BRICK. DON'T LOSE FAITH.
YOU1000000102_S0000178	I'M CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME GOING WAS THAT I LOVED WHAT I DID. YOU'VE GOT TO FIND WHAT YOU LOVE. AND THAT IS AS TRUE FOR WORK AS IT IS FOR YOUR LOVERS.
YOU1000000102_S0000179	YOUR WORK IS GOING TO FILL A LARGE PART OF YOUR LIFE, AND THE ONLY WAY TO BE TRULY SATISFIED IS TO DO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS GREAT WORK.
YOU1000000102_S0000180	AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO GREAT WORK IS TO LOVE WHAT YOU DO. IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET, KEEP LOOKING.
YOU1000000102_S0000182	AND DON'T SETTLE. AS WITH ALL MATTERS OF THE HEART, YOU'LL KNOW WHEN YOU FIND IT. AND LIKE ANY GREAT RELATIONSHIP, IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER.
YOU1000000102_S0000183	AS THE YEARS ROLL ON. SO KEEP LOOKING. DON'T SETTLE.
YOU1000000102_S0000185	MY THIRD STORY IS ABOUT DEATH.
YOU1000000102_S0000187	WHEN I WAS 17, I READ A QUOTE THAT WENT SOMETHING LIKE, IF YOU LIVE EACH DAY AS IF IT WAS YOUR LAST, SOMEDAY YOU'LL MOST CERTAINLY BE RIGHT.
YOU1000000102_S0000189	IT MADE AN IMPRESSION ON ME AND SINCE THEN FOR THE PAST 33 YEARS I'VE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR EVERY MORNING AND ASKED MYSELF
YOU1000000102_S0000190	IF TODAY WERE THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE, WOULD I WANT TO DO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO TODAY? AND WHENEVER THE ANSWER HAS BEEN NO FOR TOO MANY DAYS IN A ROW,
YOU1000000102_S0000191	I KNOW I NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING.
YOU1000000102_S0000193	REMEMBERING THAT I'LL BE DEAD SOON IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED TO HELP ME MAKE THE BIG CHOICES IN LIFE. BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYTHING
YOU1000000102_S0000194	ALL EXTERNAL EXPECTATIONS, ALL PRIDE, ALL FEAR OF EMBARRASSMENT OR FAILURE, THESE THINGS JUST FALL AWAY IN THE FACE OF DEATH, LEAVING ONLY WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT.
YOU1000000102_S0000195	REMEMBERING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DIE IS THE BEST WAY I KNOW TO AVOID THE TRAP OF THINKING YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO LOSE. YOU ARE ALREADY NAKED.
YOU1000000102_S0000196	THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART.
YOU1000000102_S0000198	ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER.
YOU1000000102_S0000200	I HAD A SCAN AT 7.30 IN THE MORNING AND IT CLEARLY SHOWED A TUMOR ON MY PANCREAS. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A PANCREAS WAS.
YOU1000000102_S0000201	THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THIS WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY A TYPE OF CANCER THAT IS INCURABLE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT TO LIVE NO LONGER THAN THREE TO SIX MONTHS.
YOU1000000102_S0000203	MY DOCTOR ADVISED ME TO GO HOME AND GET MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER, WHICH IS DOCTOR'S CODE FOR PREPARE TO DIE.
YOU1000000102_S0000204	IT MEANS TO TRY AND TELL YOUR KIDS EVERYTHING.
YOU1000000102_S0000206	YOU THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE THE NEXT 10 YEARS TO TELL THEM IN JUST A FEW MONTHS. IT MEANS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS BUTTONED UP SO THAT WILL BE AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR YOUR FAMILY.
YOU1000000102_S0000207	IT MEANS TO SAY YOUR GOODBYES.
YOU1000000102_S0000209	I LIVE WITH THAT DIAGNOSIS ALL DAY. LATER THAT EVENING, I HAD A BIOPSY WHERE THEY STUCK AN ENDOSCOPE DOWN MY THROAT, THROUGH MY STOMACH, AND INTO MY INTESTINES.
YOU1000000102_S0000210	PUT A NEEDLE INTO MY PANCREAS AND GOT A FEW CELLS FROM THE TUMOR. I WAS SEDATED, BUT MY WIFE, WHO WAS THERE, TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY VIEWED THE CELLS UNDER A MICROSCOPE
YOU1000000102_S0000211	THE DOCTORS STARTED CRYING BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY RARE FORM OF PANCREATIC CANCER THAT IS CURABLE WITH SURGERY.
YOU1000000102_S0000212	I HAD THE SURGERY AND THANKFULLY I'M FINE NOW.
YOU1000000102_S0000214	THIS WAS THE CLOSEST I'VE BEEN TO FACING DEATH, AND I HOPE IT'S THE CLOSEST I GET FOR A FEW MORE DECADES. HAVING LIVED THROUGH IT,
YOU1000000102_S0000215	I CAN NOW SAY THIS TO YOU WITH A BIT MORE CERTAINTY THAN WHEN DEATH WAS A USEFUL BUT PURELY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPT.
YOU1000000102_S0000217	NO ONE WANTS TO DIE. EVEN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN DON'T WANT TO DIE TO GET THERE.
YOU1000000102_S0000219	AND YET, DEATH IS THE DESTINATION WE ALL SHARE. NO ONE HAS EVER ESCAPED IT. AND THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE.
YOU1000000102_S0000220	BECAUSE DEATH IS VERY LIKELY THE SINGLE BEST INVENTION OF LIFE. IT'S LIFE'S CHANGE AGENT. IT CLEARS OUT THE OLD TO MAKE WAY FOR THE NEW.
YOU1000000102_S0000222	RIGHT NOW, THE NEW IS YOU.
YOU1000000102_S0000224	BUT SOMEDAY, NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW, YOU WILL GRADUALLY BECOME THE OLD AND BE CLEARED AWAY.
YOU1000000102_S0000226	SORRY TO BE SO DRAMATIC, BUT IT'S QUITE TRUE.
YOU1000000102_S0000228	YOUR TIME IS LIMITED, SO DON'T WASTE IT LIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE. DON'T BE TRAPPED BY DOGMA, WHICH IS LIVING WITH THE RESULTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S THINKING.
YOU1000000102_S0000229	DON'T LET THE NOISE OF OTHERS' OPINIONS DROWN OUT YOUR OWN INNER VOICE. AND MOST IMPORTANT, HAVE THE COURAGE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND INTUITION.
YOU1000000102_S0000230	THEY SOMEHOW ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU TRULY WANT TO BECOME. EVERYTHING ELSE IS SECONDARY.
YOU1000000102_S0000232	WHEN I WAS YOUNG, THERE WAS AN AMAZING PUBLICATION CALLED THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE BIBLES OF MY GENERATION.
YOU1000000102_S0000233	IT WAS CREATED BY A FELLOW NAMED STUART BRAND, NOT FAR FROM HERE IN MENLO PARK, AND HE BROUGHT IT TO LIFE WITH HIS POETIC TOUCH.
YOU1000000102_S0000234	THIS WAS IN THE LATE 60S, BEFORE PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND DESKTOP PUBLISHING. SO IT WAS ALL MADE WITH TYPEWRITERS, SCISSORS, AND POLAROID CAMERAS.
YOU1000000102_S0000235	IT WAS SORT OF LIKE GOOGLE IN PAPERBACK FORM 35 YEARS BEFORE GOOGLE CAME ALONG. IT WAS IDEALISTIC, OVERFLOWING WITH NEAT TOOLS AND GREAT NOTIONS.
YOU1000000102_S0000237	STEWART AND HIS TEAM PUT OUT SEVERAL ISSUES OF THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG AND THEN WHEN IT HAD RUN ITS COURSE THEY PUT OUT A FINAL ISSUE.
YOU1000000102_S0000238	IT WAS THE MID 1970S, AND I WAS YOUR AGE.
YOU1000000102_S0000240	ON THE BACK COVER OF THEIR FINAL ISSUE WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF AN EARLY MORNING COUNTRY ROAD.
YOU1000000102_S0000242	THE KIND YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF HITCHHIKING ON IF YOU WERE SO ADVENTUROUS. BENEATH IT WERE THE WORDS, STAY HUNGRY, STAY FOOLISH.
YOU1000000102_S0000243	IT WAS THEIR FAREWELL MESSAGE AS THEY SIGNED OFF, STAY HUNGRY, STAY FOOLISH. AND I HAVE ALWAYS WISHED THAT FOR MYSELF.
YOU1000000102_S0000245	AND NOW, AS YOU GRADUATE TO BEGIN ANEW, I WISH THAT FOR YOU. STAY HUNGRY, STAY FOOLISH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

YOU1000000103_S0000021	TONIGHT, CALLING THE VACCINE ROLLOUT SO FAR A DISMAL FAILURE, PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKING THIS PLEDGE.
YOU1000000103_S0000022	WE WILL DEFEAT THIS PANDEMIC. AND TO A NATION WAITING FOR ACTION, LET ME BE THE CLEAREST ON THIS POINT. HELP IS ON THE WAY.
YOU1000000103_S0000023	THE PRESIDENT NOW SIGNING EXECUTIVE ORDERS, INCLUDING REQUIRING MASKS IN MOST PLANES, TRAINS AND AIRPORTS.
YOU1000000103_S0000024	INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COVID VACCINATION SITES BY CREATING FEDERAL VACCINATION CENTERS AND PLANNING TO INVOKE THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO SPEED VACCINE PRODUCTION.
YOU1000000103_S0000025	WE'RE STILL IN A DARK WINTER OF THIS PANDEMIC.
YOU1000000103_S0000026	IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.
YOU1000000103_S0000027	BUT TONIGHT, DR. ANTHONY FAUCI SAYING HE SEES POSITIVE SIGNS.
YOU1000000103_S0000028	WHEN YOU LOOK MORE RECENTLY AT THE SEVEN DAY AVERAGE OF CASES, RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE PLATEAUING.
YOU1000000103_S0000029	THERE ARE STILL ISSUES WITH SUPPLY AND VACCINE DISTRIBUTION.
YOU1000000103_S0000030	BIDEN'S VACCINE GOAL, 100 MILLION SHOTS IN 100 DAYS.
YOU1000000103_S0000031	IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION STARTING FROM SCRATCH WITH THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION EFFORT OR ARE YOU PICKING UP WHERE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LEFT OFF?
YOU1000000103_S0000032	NO, I MEAN, WE CERTAINLY ARE NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE THERE IS ACTIVITY GOING ON IN THE DISTRIBUTION. IT'S TAKING WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT AMPLIFYING IT IN A BIG WAY.
YOU1000000103_S0000033	AND THIS PREDICTION.
YOU1000000103_S0000034	IF WE GET 70 TO 85 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY VACCINATED, I BELIEVE BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE FALL, WE WILL BE APPROACHING A DEGREE OF NORMALITY.
YOU1000000103_S0000035	DR. FAUCI ALSO TAKING THIS SWIPE AT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.
YOU1000000103_S0000036	THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN GET UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW, WHAT THE EVIDENCE, WHAT THE SCIENCE IS, AND KNOW THAT'S IT. LET THE SCIENCE SPEAK.
YOU1000000103_S0000037	IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A LIBERATING FEELING.
YOU1000000103_S0000038	MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS FACING SOME REPUBLICAN PUSHBACK TONIGHT FOR HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON DAY ONE, INCLUDING REJOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT AND CANCELING THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE.
YOU1000000103_S0000039	PLUS, A PLAN FOR A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
YOU1000000103_S0000040	PRESIDENT BIDEN SOUNDED A LOT OF NOTES OF UNITY IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN HE GOT BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE IMPLEMENTED A BUNCH OF FAR LEFT POLICIES.
YOU1000000103_S0000041	TODAY, HOUSE SPEAKER PELOSI WAS PRESSED IF THE LOOMING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP UNDERCUTS PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CALL FOR UNITY.
YOU1000000103_S0000042	THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES COMMITTED AN ACT
YOU1000000103_S0000044	INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION.
YOU1000000103_S0000045	I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY UNIFYING TO SAY, OH, LET'S JUST FORGET IT AND MOVE ON. THAT'S NOT HOW YOU UNIFY.
YOU1000000103_S0000047	AND KRISTEN, A NEW HEADLINE ON THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL FROM SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL TONIGHT.
YOU1000000103_S0000049	THAT'S RIGHT, LESTER. MITCH MCCONNELL HAS PROPOSED DELAYING THE TRIAL UNTIL EARLY FEBRUARY TO ALLOW BOTH SIDES TO PREPARE. MEANWHILE, SPEAKER PELOSI IS STILL NOT SAYING WHEN SHE'LL SEND THE IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE OVER TO THE SENATE. LESTER.
YOU1000000103_S0000050	KRISTEN WELKER AT THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT. THANKS THAT EFFORT TO GET THE VACCINE OUT FASTER CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH AS MORE STATES REPORT SHORTAGES AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF APPOINTMENTS ARE CANCELED.
YOU1000000103_S0000051	BUT MORE ON THAT, HERE'S GABE GUTIERREZ.
YOU1000000103_S0000053	TONIGHT, NEW YORK CITY IS RUNNING OUT OF THE CORONAVIRUS VACCINE.
YOU1000000103_S0000054	WE'RE SENIOR CITIZENS. MY HUSBAND HAS, YOU KNOW, HEART PROBLEMS. SO YEAH, YOU WORRY.
YOU1000000103_S0000055	FRAN BONAGE GOT HER SHOT TODAY, BUT THE CITY HAS BEEN FORCED TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE 15 OTHER VACCINATION SITES.
YOU1000000103_S0000056	AND NOW FIRST RESPONDERS, INCLUDING HARD HIT EMS WORKERS, ARE HAVING TO SUSPEND THEIR FIRST DOSES.
YOU1000000103_S0000057	HOW FRUSTRATING HAS THIS PROCESS BEEN?
YOU1000000103_S0000058	GABE, IT'S PAINFUL IS THE WORD I WANT TO USE. FRUSTRATING AND PAINFUL.
YOU1000000103_S0000059	HOW SOON BEFORE NEW YORK CITY RUNS OUT OF VACCINE?

YOU1000000103_S0000061	MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO SAYS AT LEAST 23,000 APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN RESCHEDULED.
YOU1000000103_S0000062	THE VACCINE SUPPLY IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE INCREASED EVERY SINGLE WEEK.
YOU1000000103_S0000064	AND WE FOUND THAT WE HIT A WALL QUICKLY.
YOU1000000103_S0000065	AT LEAST A DOZEN STATES ARE NOW REPORTING VACCINE SUPPLY SHORTAGES, SOME ROLLING BACK ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.
YOU1000000103_S0000066	THIS HOSPITAL IN FLORIDA IS NOW SUSPENDING FIRST DOSES STARTING SUNDAY. GOVERNORS ARE BEGGING FOR FEDERAL HELP.
YOU1000000103_S0000067	OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS REALLY SIMPLE. IT'S LACK OF VACCINE.
YOU1000000103_S0000068	IT'S A REVERSAL FROM JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN MANY STATES DIDN'T HAVE THE SPACE OR THE PEOPLE TO ADMINISTER ALL THE SHOTS.
YOU1000000103_S0000069	NOW IT'S A SUPPLY ISSUE.
YOU1000000103_S0000070	IT'S REALLY A DAY BY DAY CONVERSATION OF TRYING TO SAY, HOW DO WE GET MORE? HOW CAN WE GET MORE? WE'D LOVE TO HAVE MORE.
YOU1000000103_S0000071	NOW WE'RE GOING TO COUNT BY FIVE.
YOU1000000103_S0000072	KAREN STACHOWIAK IS A FIRST GRADE TEACHER NEAR BUFFALO.
YOU1000000103_S0000073	VERY STRESSFUL RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000103_S0000074	SHE WAITED ON THE PHONE FOR HOURS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR HERSELF AND HER PARENTS, ONLY TO HAVE IT CANCELED DAYS LATER.
YOU1000000103_S0000075	MY EMOTIONS ARE UP AND DOWN. SATURDAY WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS, I SERIOUSLY WANTED TO CRY.
YOU1000000103_S0000077	ALL RIGHT, GABE, JOINING US NOW FROM A VACCINATION SITE THAT'S BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE. GABE, HOW LONG BEFORE THOSE APPOINTMENTS CAN BE RESCHEDULED?
YOU1000000103_S0000079	WELL, LESTER, THERE ARE WAITING NEW SHIPMENTS ANY DAY NOW, BUT THE MAYOR HERE SAYS THAT IT COULD TAKE WEEKS, NOT DAYS TO CLEAR OUT THIS BACKLOG. LESTER.
YOU1000000103_S0000080	ALL RIGHT GABE YOU TEAR US THANKS
YOU1000000103_S0000081	A COMPLICATING FACTOR IN ALL THIS, THOSE NEW STRAINS OF THE VIRUS, ESPECIALLY A DANGEROUS VARIANT FROM SOUTH AFRICA, THAT IS ELEVATING CONCERN TONIGHT. RICHARD ENGEL HAS MORE.
YOU1000000103_S0000083	IN LONDON, COVID DEATHS HAVE RISEN TO NEARLY TWICE LAST YEAR'S PEAK, LARGELY BECAUSE OF THAT NEW, MORE CONTAGIOUS STRAIN OF THE VIRUS.
YOU1000000103_S0000084	THE CDC ESTIMATES COULD BE DOMINANT IN THE US IN MARCH.
YOU1000000103_S0000085	IT'S NOT THE ONLY STRAIN. A SOUTH AFRICAN VARIANT MAY HAVE EVOLVED TO INFECT PEOPLE MORE THAN ONCE.
YOU1000000103_S0000086	THIS VIRUS CAN SPREAD A BIT MORE EFFICIENTLY FROM PERSON TO PERSON.
YOU1000000103_S0000087	DR. RICHARD LESSELS DISCOVERED THE SOUTH AFRICAN VARIANT.
YOU1000000103_S0000088	WE WORRY THAT THIS VARIANT MAY BE ABLE TO ESCAPE SOME OF THE NATURAL IMMUNITY THAT'S ELICITED BY INFECTION WITH THE VIRUS.
YOU1000000103_S0000089	THAT MEANS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS VARIANT IS ABLE TO REINFECT PEOPLE.
YOU1000000103_S0000090	WHAT ABOUT THE VACCINES? THE VACCINES WE HAVE NOW, CAN THEY STOP THE SOUTH AFRICAN VARIANT?
YOU1000000103_S0000091	SO WE DON'T KNOW YET AND THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE NOW ADDRESSING.
YOU1000000103_S0000092	WHILE THE DATA IS STILL COMING IN, A NEW STUDY, YET TO BE PEER REVIEWED, REPORTS THE SOUTH AFRICAN VARIANT'S ABILITY TO EVADE ANTIBODIES.
YOU1000000103_S0000093	MAY MAKE CURRENT VACCINES LESS EFFECTIVE. LESTER.

YOU1000000103_S0000098	JUST AS TROUBLING THE ACCELERATED RATE IN WHICH THE COUNTRY SURPASSED 400,000 DEATHS.
YOU1000000103_S0000099	STATES LIKE ALABAMA, ARIZONA, AND PENNSYLVANIA HAVE THE HIGHEST DEATH RATES IN THE NATION.
YOU1000000103_S0000100	THESE PATIENTS ARE SCARED.
YOU1000000103_S0000101	BRITTANY SCHILLING HAS WATCHED THE VIRUS DESTROY FAMILIES FOR MONTHS.
YOU1000000103_S0000102	IT'S JUST IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THESE PATIENTS GO THROUGH WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH.
YOU1000000103_S0000103	WHILE HOSPITALS AND HOT SPOTS REMAIN OVERRUN, THERE IS MEASURABLE PROGRESS. EVEN IN LA COUNTY, THE NUMBERS ARE ENCOURAGING, THOUGH STILL WORRISOME.
YOU1000000103_S0000104	COVID 19 IS STILL RAMPANT AT OUR WORKPLACES, IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO THE END IS NOT YET IN SIGHT.
YOU1000000103_S0000105	ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, WHILE AMERICANS KNOW WEARING A MASK GIVES THEM PROTECTION, ONLY ABOUT HALF SAY THEY ALWAYS COMPLY WHEN COMING INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHERS.
YOU1000000103_S0000106	EXPERTS INSIST AS AMERICANS DEFY PRECAUTIONS, THE DEATH TOLL WILL RISE.
YOU1000000103_S0000107	WE'VE WATCHED FOR MONTHS NOW PEOPLE LOSING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS, AND IT'S STILL SHOCKING WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOURSELF.
YOU1000000103_S0000108	AMANDA PEACHY FOLLOWED HER FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS BECOMING A NURSE. TOM PEACHY LOST HIS FIGHT TO COVID IN THE VERY HOSPITAL WHERE HE SAVED LIVES.

YOU1000000103_S0000118	LATRICIA WILDER IS A BIDEN VOTER FROM MICHIGAN, HOPEFUL BUT ALSO WORRIED SHE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN THE FITNESS STUDIO SHE OWNS.
YOU1000000103_S0000119	WHAT AN OPERATION IS, IS THAT IT GIVES ME HOPE THAT I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP OPERATING ON LUCK. I NEED CONCRETE THINGS TO HAPPEN SO THAT MY BUSINESS CAN SURVIVE.
YOU1000000103_S0000120	BEFORE THE ELECTION, WE SPOKE WITH REPUBLICAN BUSINESS OWNER ALEJANDRO PUGA IN FLORIDA.
YOU1000000103_S0000121	I SAW THE PRESIDENT WORKING HARD MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S RELIEF, MONEY RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
YOU1000000103_S0000122	NOW, HE'S WORRIED ABOUT A DIVIDED AMERICA.
YOU1000000103_S0000123	WE WANT TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. I DON'T LIKE WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE PUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE ALL IN THAT BASKET OF DOMESTIC TERRORISTS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE I AM. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY.
YOU1000000103_S0000124	IN WISCONSIN, TRUMP VOTER ARLETTA ALLEN TOLD US SHE TOO IS GIVING PRESIDENT BIDEN A CHANCE.
YOU1000000103_S0000125	I SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT I VOTE. HOWEVER, WHOEVER'S SITTING IN THAT SEAT, THAT'S WHO I PRAY FOR.
YOU1000000103_S0000126	DO YOU FIND YOURSELF HOPEFUL OR PESSIMISTIC WHEN YOU STAND AHEAD AT THE REST OF 2021?
YOU1000000103_S0000128	I'M ALWAYS HOPEFUL. WE'VE OVERCOME SOME THINGS OVER THE MANY CENTURIES THAT HAVE PASSED. AND THIS TIME IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. WE WILL OVERCOME. WE CERTAINLY WILL OVERCOME.
YOU1000000103_S0000129	WHAT ABOUT THE LOOMING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP? WE ASKED INDIANA DEMOCRAT CYNTHIA MORAZ.
YOU1000000103_S0000130	OUR DEMOCRACY IS FRAGILE RIGHT NOW, AND WE MUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PROTECT IT, AND THAT MEANS HOLDING FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE.
YOU1000000103_S0000131	BUT NEVADA REPUBLICAN MYRNA DONATO TOLD US IT ONLY DEEPENS THE DIVIDE.
YOU1000000103_S0000132	I REALLY DON'T FEEL THAT THERE'S GROUNDS FOR IT. LET BIDEN GO AHEAD AND GO FORWARD. IMPEACHMENT'S NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.
YOU1000000103_S0000133	AND THEN THERE'S BIDEN VOTER MARY GRACE VIDAL UP WHO WE MET IN PENNSYLVANIA JUST MONTHS AFTER HER 83 YEAR OLD MOTHER DIED FROM COVID.

YOU1000000104_S0000009	AND I'VE GOT NICE WEATHER ON TAP FOR YOU FOR FRIDAY. EVEN THE FIRST HALF OF YOUR WEEKEND SHOULD NOT BE TOO BAD.
YOU1000000104_S0000010	ALRIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR CURRENT CONDITIONS. WE HAD HIGHS TODAY RIGHT AROUND 74 DEGREES. OUR TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE INTO THE UPPER 60S.
YOU1000000104_S0000011	SO ONCE AGAIN, WE GOT TO ENJOY A DAY TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES ABOVE AVERAGE. SO VERY NICE OUT THERE AND IT WILL BE EVEN WARMER TOMORROW.
YOU1000000104_S0000012	TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE UPPER 80S. AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK UP TO NORMAL TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. MANY AREAS WILL BE CLOSE TO 80 DEGREES BY TOMORROW.
YOU1000000104_S0000013	LOOKING AT OUR CURRENT TEMPERATURES, 64 IN VAN NUYS AT 62 IN PASADENA, 62 DOWNTOWN MID 60S IN THE IE LOW 60S AT THE BEACHES.
YOU1000000104_S0000014	THE BEACHES, ALTHOUGH THAT WILL BE THE PLACE TO BE TOMORROW. WELL, LET ME JUST WARN YOU, THE OCEAN WATERS WILL BE VERY DANGEROUS.
YOU1000000104_S0000015	WE'VE GOT HIGH SURF ADVISORIES IN EFFECT. SURF ANYWHERE BETWEEN ABOUT 5 TO 8 FEET, BUT BY TOMORROW, ESPECIALLY IN VENTURA, ESPECIALLY ALONG THOSE WEST FACING BEACHES, WE COULD GET SURF UP TO AROUND 14 FEET.
YOU1000000104_S0000016	SO AGAIN, DO BE CAREFUL. WE HAD SUNNY SKIES ALL DAY AND THEN WE SAW SOME PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS. BUT JUST AGAIN MAKING FOR A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
YOU1000000104_S0000017	WARM NIGHT, WARM DAYS, BUT AT NIGHT WE'VE GOT THOSE CLEAR SKIES, SO IT WILL BE CHILLY AGAIN TONIGHT, SO KEEP THAT IN MIND.
YOU1000000104_S0000018	THE OFFSHORE FLOW KEEPING US NICE AND MILD, BUT I'D SAY WE'VE BEEN WARM IN SOME AREAS BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. ALL THANKS TO HIGH PRESSURE, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS GETTING NUDGED OUT JUST IN TIME FOR THE WEEKEND.
YOU1000000104_S0000019	SO SATURDAY WILL BE THAT DAY OF TRANSITION. WE'LL START TO SEE MORE CLOUDS MOVE IN.
YOU1000000104_S0000020	IT'LL BE COOLER HIGHS WILL BE BACK INTO THE 60S AND THEN THIS STORM SYSTEM SWINGS THROUGH ON SUNDAY, BRINGING US SOME RAIN.
YOU1000000104_S0000021	AND I'M TALKING ABOUT ABOUT A HALF AN INCH OF RAIN IN MANY AREAS. SO DO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND THEN LOWERING SNOW LEVELS BY EARLY MONDAY MORNING.
YOU1000000104_S0000022	AND THEN BY MONDAY IT IS JUST GOING TO BE COLD AND WINDY OUT THERE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING OUR HIGHS TOMORROW WILL BE 70 AT THE BEACHES, 75 IN THE LA AND OC METRO AREAS.
YOU1000000104_S0000023	78 INLAND END IN THE VALLEYS AND AGAIN TEMPERATURES DROP 5 TO 10 DEGREES BY SATURDAY AS THAT FRONT APPROACHES.
YOU1000000104_S0000024	AND THEN SUNDAY WILL BE THE DAY. BE INDOORS, DO SOMETHING INDOORS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE INTO THE LOW 60S, BUT WE WILL HAVE LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY ON AND OFF.
YOU1000000104_S0000025	MONDAY WILL BE COOL AND BREEZY AND THEN TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD UNDER SUNNY SKIES BY NEXT WEEK. ALL RIGHT, NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE SKI REPORT.
YOU1000000104_S0000026	THIS SKI REPORT IS SPONSORED BY UTAH TOURISM, THE GREATEST SNOW ON EARTH.

YOU1000000105_S0000046	THANK YOU.
YOU1000000105_S0000047	IT WAS LIKE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE WERE WATCHING IT AT HOME. WE'RE LIKE, OH MY, WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN THESE TWO?
YOU1000000105_S0000048	AND DID YOU FEEL LIKE IT DID TO PETE? WELL, I KNOW IT CAUSED THIS BIG CONTROVERSY BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN EMOTE, YOU HAD SUCH A CONNECTION WITH BRADLEY THAT INSTANTLY.
YOU1000000105_S0000049	AND I GUESS THIS IS A COMPLIMENT. PEOPLE STARTED SAYING, LIKE, OH, THEY MUST BE IN LOVE.
YOU1000000105_S0000051	FIRST OF ALL LIKE LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA QUITE FRANKLY IS THE TOILET OF THE INTERNET
YOU1000000105_S0000052	YES, IT IS.

YOU1000000105_S0000055	YES.
YOU1000000105_S0000056	I MEAN, THIS IS A LOVE SONG, SHALLOW. THE MOVIE, A STAR IS BORN, IT'S A LOVE STORY. WE WORKED SO HARD.
YOU1000000105_S0000057	WE WORKED ALL WEEK ON THAT PERFORMANCE. BRADLEY, WHO, YOU KNOW, I LIKE NEVER RELINQUISH CONTROL ABOUT A LIVE STAGE PERFORMANCE. I'VE DONE A MILLION OF THEM.
YOU1000000105_S0000058	BUT HE DIRECTED THIS FILM, AND HE DIRECTED ALL OF, OBVIOUSLY, THE MUSICAL MOMENTS IN THE FILM.
YOU1000000105_S0000059	AND HE DIRECTED OBVIOUSLY SHALLOW THE MOMENT IN THE FILM SO I KNEW THAT HE HAD THE VISION FOR HOW IT SHOULD GO.
YOU1000000105_S0000060	AND SO I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK, BRADLEY? AND HE GAVE ME, HE LAID IT ALL OUT. I MEAN, EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAW, THE WAY THAT IT WAS SHOT.
YOU1000000105_S0000061	THE WAY THAT THEY PUSH THE PIANO OUT YOU SAW THEM, YOU KNOW, BUT BUT THE PIANO TOGETHER AND
YOU1000000105_S0000062	NO INTRO.
YOU1000000105_S0000063	UP ON STAGE, NO INTRO, ALL OF IT, THAT WAS ALL HIM. AND HE EVEN ALSO WAS THE ONE THAT WAS LIKE, I THINK THAT THE AUDIENCE SHOULD BE LIT, YOU KNOW, SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST LIT, THE AUDIENCE IS LIT.
YOU1000000105_S0000064	SO THEN I CALLED ROY BENNETT, WHO I WORK WITH, AND HE DOES MY LIGHTING. AND I'M LIKE, WE NEED TO LIGHT THE ENTIRE ROOM WITH AMBER LIGHTS BECAUSE BRADLEY WANTS HONEYCOMB, AND WE'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS.
YOU1000000105_S0000065	AND YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST GREAT. AND FROM A PERFORMANCE PERSPECTIVE, IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF US THAT WE WERE CONNECTED THE ENTIRE TIME.
YOU1000000105_S0000066	LOOK, I'VE HAD MY ARMS WRAPPED AROUND TONY BENNETT FOR THREE YEARS TOURING THE WORLD.
YOU1000000105_S0000068	WHEN YOU'RE SINGING LOVE SONGS, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL.
YOU1000000105_S0000069	ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH TONY BENNETT? BE HONEST.
YOU1000000105_S0000071	NO. NO. I'M AN ARTIST, AND I GUESS WE DID A GOOD JOB, AND FULL JOB.
YOU1000000105_S0000072	I KNOW, YEAH. YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB.
YOU1000000105_S0000074	BRADLEY DID A GREAT JOB. I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. AND THE IDEA OF, I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING TO GO ON STAGE AND SING ON THE OSCARS. THAT'S TERRIFYING JUST TO START.
YOU1000000105_S0000075	BUT THEN TO SING WITH YOU AND TO, YOU KNOW, BE TRADING LINES WITH YOU IN A MOVIE, YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE. BUT YOU'RE ON LIVE TELEVISION. WAS HE TERRIFIED?
YOU1000000105_S0000076	NO!
YOU1000000105_S0000077	NO!
YOU1000000105_S0000078	BECAUSE WE PRACTICED AND WE WORKED HARD, YOU KNOW. BRADLEY'S A MUSICIAN. I MEAN...
YOU1000000105_S0000079	MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS I WAS JUST SO EXCITED FOR PEOPLE NOT ONLY AT HOME BUT, YOU KNOW, OUR PEERS IN THE ROOM TO SEE HIM SING LIVE.
YOU1000000105_S0000080	TO SEE THAT HE CAN SING LIVE.
YOU1000000105_S0000081	SAYING EVERY TAKE IN THIS MOVIE LIVE EVERY SINGLE TIME. I MEAN, ALL OF IT.
YOU1000000105_S0000082	THERE WAS NO LIP SYNC. AND I WAS SO EXCITED, AND I WAS IN THE MOMENT. BUT WHEN WE STARTED, AND HE STARTS SINGING, TELL ME SOMETHING, GIRL.
YOU1000000105_S0000083	THE WHOLE AUDIENCE STARTED CHEERING AND I WAS LIKE, YES, BRADLEY! YES, THEY LOVE IT! KEEP GOING! WE'VE GOT THIS! YOU KNOW, IT WAS GREAT.
YOU1000000105_S0000084	SO IF YOU WERE ACTING, YOU COULD HAVE THAT SAME CONNECTION WITH ME IF WE WERE SINGING THAT SONG?
YOU1000000105_S0000086	YEAH.

YOU1000000108_S0000141	LIKE THERE'S THIS ONE SKETCH WE DID THAT WAS ABOUT THIS PIXIE THAT WOULD APPEAR WHENEVER RACIST THINGS HAPPENS. WHENEVER SOMEONE MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE...
YOU1000000108_S0000142	THEY CALLING YOU THAT N WORD
YOU1000000108_S0000143	HUH.
YOU1000000108_S0000144	BUT DON'T SAY IT. AND IT WAS FUNNY. AND THE PREMISE OF THE SKETCH WAS THAT EVERY RACE HAD THIS LIKE PIXIE, THIS LIKE RACIAL CONFLICT.
YOU1000000108_S0000146	AND THE
YOU1000000108_S0000148	BUT THE PIXIE WAS IN BLACKFACE. NOW.
YOU1000000108_S0000150	BLACKFACE IS A VERY DIFFICULT IMAGE. BUT THE REASON I HAD CHOSEN BLACKFACE AT THE TIME WAS BECAUSE THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE VISUAL PERSONIFICATION OF THE INWARD.
YOU1000000108_S0000151	IT WAS A GOOD SPIRIT OR INTENTION BEHIND IT.
YOU1000000108_S0000153	BUT WHAT I DIDN'T CONSIDER IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WATCH THE SHOW.
YOU1000000108_S0000155	AND HOW THE WAY PEOPLE USE TELEVISION IS SUBJECTIVE.
YOU1000000108_S0000156	I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
YOU1000000108_S0000157	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000158	I COULD FINISH, BECAUSE I HAVE A STORY TO TELL YOU.
YOU1000000108_S0000159	SO THEN WHEN I'M ON THE SET AND WE'RE FINALLY TAPING THE SKETCH.
YOU1000000108_S0000161	SOMEBODY ON SET THAT WAS WHITE LAUGHED IN SUCH A WAY. I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE OF PEOPLE LAUGHING WITH ME AND PEOPLE LAUGHING AT ME.
YOU1000000108_S0000163	AND WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D EVER GOTTEN A LAUGH THAT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.
YOU1000000108_S0000164	HMM.
YOU1000000108_S0000165	NOT JUST UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT LIKE, SHOULD I FIRE THIS PERSON?
YOU1000000108_S0000167	UH...
YOU1000000108_S0000169	AND AT THE SAME TIME, I'M JUST NOT A NATURALLY ASSERTIVE PERSON.
YOU1000000108_S0000170	WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE LAUGH?
YOU1000000108_S0000172	I KNOW ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO BE WATCHING TV.
YOU1000000108_S0000174	THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.
YOU1000000108_S0000176	THEN THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST FANS LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT SCREAM I'M RICK JAMES BE AT MY CONCERTS.
YOU1000000108_S0000177	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000178	THAT THIS IS A LONG FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF CELEBRITY WORSHIP, RAT. THEY'RE GONNA GET SOMETHING...
YOU1000000108_S0000180	COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
YOU1000000108_S0000181	COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
YOU1000000108_S0000182	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000183	THEY'RE CONCERNED.
YOU1000000108_S0000184	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000185	I DON'T WANT BLACK PEOPLE TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN ME FOR PUTTING THAT OUT THERE.
YOU1000000108_S0000186	NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN YOURSELF.
YOU1000000108_S0000188	YOU KNOW WHAT, HOPE?
YOU1000000108_S0000190	YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU1000000108_S0000191	I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO WHY YOU JUST DISAPPEARED. SO YOU HAD THAT MOMENT, THE GUY'S LAUGHING TOO MUCH. WAS THAT THE TIPPING POINT FOR YOU? WAS THAT THE STRAW?
YOU1000000108_S0000192	THAT WAS THE FIRST TIPPING POINT.
YOU1000000108_S0000193	OK?
YOU1000000108_S0000194	I DIDN'T EVEN PUT IN THE PAPER THAT I HAD PNEUMONIA OR GOD KNOWS WHAT.
YOU1000000108_S0000195	HMM.
YOU1000000108_S0000196	IT WAS WALKING PNEUMONIA, BECAUSE I WAS WALKING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
YOU1000000108_S0000198	UH, I WAS RELAXING.
YOU1000000108_S0000200	AND THEN AFTER THAT, I WAS COMING BACK TO THE SHOW.
YOU1000000108_S0000201	AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE, WELL, DAVE, YOU SHOULD JUST BACK UP THE PNEUMONIA STORY. AND I WAS LIKE, THAT WAS YOUR THING. I'M NOT BACKING UP A PNEUMONIA STORY.
YOU1000000108_S0000203	AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT WAS IN THE PAPER THAT I HAD WRITER'S BLOCK. THEN I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GETTING READY TO GET STRESSFUL BECAUSE I HADN'T EVEN STARTED WRITING. I WAS ON SCHEDULE TO WRITE. SO I WAS LIKE, WHAT'S...
YOU1000000108_S0000204	YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE THEY GOING TO...
YOU1000000108_S0000205	SO THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE TRYING TO FEED.
YOU1000000108_S0000206	MANIPULATE ME? SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO PUT YOUNG DAVE IN A COMPROMISING POSITION.
YOU1000000108_S0000208	MM, MM.
YOU1000000108_S0000209	BUT, YOU KNOW, OKAY, SO THEN I GOT WORRIED. SO WHEN I SAID I'M NOT GONNA DO IT, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WAS LIKE, WELL, NOW HE HAS WALKING PNEUMONIA. AND THEN I KNEW LONG BEFORE I WALKED, I HAD CONSIDERED WALKING.
YOU1000000108_S0000210	YOU HAD CONSIDERED.
YOU1000000108_S0000211	I WENT BACK TO WORK AND THE VITAMIN LOVE WAS GONE BECAUSE IT WAS A REAL UGLY NEGOTIATION.
YOU1000000108_S0000212	IT'S A SITUATION WHERE NOW EVERYBODY'S TAKING CREDIT FOR THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER. SO IT'S JUST, IT WAS GETTING RIDICULOUS. AND I KNEW I WAS GOING TO LEAVE, SO I GOT AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, AND I BOUNCED.
YOU1000000108_S0000213	AND I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY WHERE I WAS GOING.
YOU1000000108_S0000215	THE WHOLE TIME, THEY'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE ME I'M INSANE.
YOU1000000108_S0000217	THEY WERE TRYING TO GET ME TO TAKE PSYCHOTIC MEDICATION.
YOU1000000108_S0000219	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000221	LIKE I'M SITTING AROUND, YOU KNOW, I WAS STRESSED OUT. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TELLING ME I WAS INSANE, I BELIEVE THAT THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
YOU1000000108_S0000223	SO THIS WAS TROUBLESOME.
YOU1000000108_S0000224	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000226	I'M NOT TAKING THIS MEDICINE MAN, BECAUSE I KNOW THESE PEOPLE BE TRYING TO CONTROL YOU OR MAYBE DISCREDIT YOU. I WAS AFRAID LIKE, YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000108_S0000227	BUT YOU WERE STRESSED OUT.
YOU1000000108_S0000228	THERE'S NO QUESTION, BUT IT'S VERY STRESSFUL FOR SOMEONE TO CONSTANTLY WALK BEHIND YOU AND SAY, YOU'RE INSANE.
YOU1000000108_S0000229	OH, HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS? I SHOW UP TO WORK THE FIRST WEEK, AND THEY, WHERE MY OFFICE USED TO BE, THEY BUILT A WALL THERE.
YOU1000000108_S0000231	WHY?
YOU1000000108_S0000232	I DIDN'T KNOW WHY.
YOU1000000108_S0000234	BUT IT CAME OUT LATER THAT THEY WERE LIKE, WELL, THEY SAID YOU WANTED IT. I DON'T WANT TO BE WALLED UP IN THE OFFICE.
YOU1000000108_S0000235	I LIKE HANGING OUT AND TALKING.
YOU1000000108_S0000236	OK. SO YOU GOT UP, AND YOU WALKED OUT, AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE YOU WERE GOING. DID YOUR FAMILY KNOW?
YOU1000000108_S0000238	NAH, WELL, NAH, I CALL MY BROTHER.
YOU1000000108_S0000239	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000240	ME AND MY BROTHER REAL COOL, I CALLED HIM UP, WAS LIKE, I'M GOING TO AFRICA. HE WAS LIKE, COOL, MAN, IT'S GOOD.
YOU1000000108_S0000241	DID YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING?
YOU1000000108_S0000242	NOW.
YOU1000000108_S0000243	NO, NOBODY KNEW.
YOU1000000108_S0000244	NOW, I BOUNCE.
YOU1000000108_S0000246	NOW, THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE CRAZY.
YOU1000000108_S0000247	IT'S NOT CRAZY BECAUSE THE SITUATION KIND OF WARRANTED IT
YOU1000000108_S0000248	OK.
YOU1000000108_S0000249	BECAUSE CERTAIN PEOPLE AROUND ME WERE PUTTING MY SANITY IN QUESTION, I WOULD MEET TOO MUCH OBSTRUCTION IF I WAS TO SAY I'M DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000108_S0000250	YEAH. OK.
YOU1000000108_S0000251	SO I FIGURED, IT WASN'T THAT I DIDN'T TELL MY WIFE, IT WAS LIKE I'M NOT TELLING HER TILL AFTER I'M GONE, WHICH WAS A MISTAKE.
YOU1000000108_S0000252	BUT IT WASN'T A CRAZY MISTAKE. IT'S JUST A DUDE.
YOU1000000108_S0000253	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000255	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000256	IT'S JUST LIKE THAT. AS A HUSBAND, SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHERE YOU WERE GOING. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
YOU1000000108_S0000257	SHE WAS GONNA KNOW I WELL, YOU KNOW, I BASICALLY I CALLED MY BROTHER I TOLD AND I GAVE HIM A LIST YOU CALL SO AND SO SO AND SO SO AND SO AND I TOOK OFF
YOU1000000108_S0000259	THEN I CALL MY WIFE.
YOU1000000108_S0000260	OK, WHY WERE YOU GOING TO AFRICA SPECIFICALLY?
YOU1000000108_S0000261	ONE, I NEEDED A BREAK.
YOU1000000108_S0000262	NEED A BREAK.
YOU1000000108_S0000263	TWO, WE HAVE FAMILY FRIENDS DOWN THERE. AND THREE, I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS A PLACE WHERE I COULD REALLY
YOU1000000108_S0000265	REFLECT. IT'S JUST A PLACE THAT I GOT TO GO.
YOU1000000108_S0000266	AND WHAT DID YOU CONCLUDE ABOUT YOURSELF?
YOU1000000108_S0000268	OH, WELL, THAT I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION. I FELT REALLY GUILTY ABOUT BEING ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL.
YOU1000000108_S0000270	I FELT GUILTY ABOUT IT BECAUSE, UH...
YOU1000000108_S0000272	I FORGOT THE HOSTILITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF SHOW BUSINESS.
YOU1000000108_S0000274	IT'S NOT A DOCILE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT.
YOU1000000108_S0000275	YES.
YOU1000000108_S0000276	YOU KNOW, AND THERE'S SOME QUOTE THAT SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME. IT SAYS, SUCCESS TAKES YOU WHERE CHARACTER CANNOT SUSTAIN YOU.
YOU1000000108_S0000277	WOW, THAT'S A GOOD QUOTE.
YOU1000000108_S0000278	I DON'T CARE WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE OR HOW YOU THINK YOU DO IT, YOU CANNOT IMAGINE.
YOU1000000108_S0000280	WHAT CELEBRITIES GO THROUGH.
YOU1000000108_S0000282	AS FAR AS HOW YOUR INTEGRITY AND YOUR SELF IMAGE AND ALL THESE THINGS.
YOU1000000108_S0000283	OK, THIS IS A THEORY THAT I'VE ALWAYS HAD, AND I'VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. THE IDEA THAT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE WHEN THIS BIG THING HITS, WHEN THE BIG STUFF COMES,
YOU1000000108_S0000284	IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND CAN'T STAND IN THE CENTER OF YOURSELF, THEN YOU END UP CONFUSED AND FEELING THWARTED AND FEELING DIFFUSED IN MANY DIRECTIONS.
YOU1000000108_S0000285	BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS PULLING ON YOU. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT WAS PART OF YOUR ISSUE, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, FIND THE CENTER FOR YOURSELF?
YOU1000000108_S0000286	ABSOLUTELY.
YOU1000000108_S0000287	WHEN YOU ARE SUDDENLY GIVEN A $50 MILLION CONTRACT WHEN YOU'VE BEEN MAKING I DON'T KNOW WHAT BEFORE, THAT IS A LOT TO ORCHESTRATE, TO HANDLE, AND A LOT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT.
YOU1000000108_S0000288	OH, IN THAT SENSE, IT WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE THE CEO OF A $50 MILLION COMPANY. GOOD LUCK.
YOU1000000108_S0000289	YEAH, YEAH. NOW YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
YOU1000000108_S0000290	RIGHT.
YOU1000000108_S0000291	BUT YOU'VE WORKED YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR IT. YOU WANTED IT.
YOU1000000108_S0000293	YOU KNOW, STRUGGLED TO GET IT. SACRIFICE. SACRIFICE. REJECTED MANY TIMES. TOLD THAT THINGS WOULDN'T WORK. WOULDN'T WORK, WOULDN'T WORK. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE THE GENIUS.
YOU1000000108_S0000294	AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU $50 MILLION. AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO HANDLE?
YOU1000000108_S0000296	NO. THAT'S THE THING THAT I ALWAYS READ THAT MAKES ME MAD. NO. IT WAS THE FAME. COULDN'T STAND THE FAME.
YOU1000000108_S0000297	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000298	I LOVE BEING FAMOUS.
YOU1000000108_S0000299	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000301	IT'S PHENOMENAL. I CAME OUT HERE AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, HOORAY. I WAS LIKE, I'M BACK ON TV.
YOU1000000108_S0000303	OK, SO THAT'S CLEAR. IT'S NOT THE FAME. IT'S WHAT?
YOU1000000108_S0000304	IT'S THE WAY THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU POSITION THEMSELVES AROUND YOU TO GET IN YOUR POCKETS AND IN YOUR MIND.
YOU1000000108_S0000305	YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000306	THAT IS INFURIATING TO ME.
YOU1000000108_S0000307	YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PHRASES I ALWAYS LOVED IS, TOO MUCH IS GIVEN, MUCH IS EXPECTED. AND PART OF IT IS.
YOU1000000108_S0000308	I KNOW, I'M LIKE SPIDER MAN. PETER, WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU1000000108_S0000309	NO, NO, NO, BUT IT DOES. IT DOES. AND PART OF THAT IS NOT JUST BEING UP ON STAGE.
YOU1000000108_S0000311	IT'S HANDLING THE REST OF THE BUSINESS AND HANDLING ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LINED UP AT YOUR DOOR FOR WHATEVER REASON.
YOU1000000108_S0000312	YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
YOU1000000108_S0000313	DON'T GET TO $50 MILLION WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED.
YOU1000000108_S0000314	YEAH. BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT, IT WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, THIS IS ENOUGH.
YOU1000000108_S0000315	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000316	COLLEAGUES WERE QUOTED AS SAYING THAT YOU HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY PARANOID. WOULD YOU SAY YOU WERE PARANOID?
YOU1000000108_S0000317	SURE. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS A BLACK MAN WITHOUT HIS PARANOIA INTACT?
YOU1000000108_S0000319	IF YOU GET...
YOU1000000108_S0000321	YOU MIGHT WIN $100 IN A POKER GAME AND BE ON THE SUBWAY. YOU'RE GONNA LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER.
YOU1000000108_S0000323	THEY JUST SAID IN EVERYTHING I HAD $50 MILLION. THAT'S LIKE MAKING ME A MARK MANN.
YOU1000000108_S0000324	SO DID YOU GO TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL?
YOU1000000108_S0000325	IN SOUTH AFRICA.
YOU1000000108_S0000326	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000327	OH
YOU1000000108_S0000329	OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I WAS SO...
YOU1000000108_S0000330	I'M ONLY ASKING
YOU1000000108_S0000331	I GOTTA GET PEOPLE THINKING WHO GOES FROM AMERICA TO AFRICA FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION
YOU1000000108_S0000333	SO TRUE.
YOU1000000108_S0000335	I CANNOT IMAGINE.
YOU1000000108_S0000336	YEAH, YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000337	I SOUND LIKE THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE JOURNALISM IN THE WORLD. I CANNOT IMAGINE.
YOU1000000108_S0000338	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000339	BEING A JOURNALIST AND HEARING THIS.
YOU1000000108_S0000340	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000341	FROM THESE PEOPLE.
YOU1000000108_S0000343	AND JUST RUNNING WITH IT. IT WAS ON EVERYTHING.
YOU1000000108_S0000344	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000345	THAT'S A FACT.
YOU1000000108_S0000346	YEAH.
YOU1000000108_S0000347	SUBSCRIBE TO THE OWN CHANNEL TODAY AND WE'LL SEE YOU ON YOUTUBE.
YOU1000000109_S0000000	A LITTLE OVER THREE MINUTES PLUS ADDITIONAL TIME, RAMONIC
YOU1000000109_S0000002	AS SO OFTEN, PORTUGAL'S HOPES REST ON CRISTIANO RONALDO'S SHOULDERS.
YOU1000000109_S0000004	RONALDO!
YOU1000000109_S0000006	IT'S A WARM, INDEED VERY HUMID NIGHT HERE IN SOCHI. THERE IS A VERY TANGIBLE SENSE OF ANTICIPATION.
YOU1000000109_S0000007	IT'S PORTUGAL'S FIRST GAME AT THE 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP RUSSIA. CRISTIANO RONALDO IS APPEARING AT HIS FOURTH WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000109_S0000008	THE THIRD IN WHICH HE'LL CATCH IN HIS COUNTRY.
YOU1000000109_S0000009	PORTUGAL WENT INTO THE 2018 WORLD CUP AS EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS. THEY HAD WON EURO 2016, BEAT FRANCE TO HOST IN THE FINAL.
YOU1000000109_S0000010	I THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS ABOUT PORTUGAL GOING INTO THE WORLD CUP, THAT PERHAPS THEY COULD FINALLY GO FARTHER THAN JUST THE GROUP STAGE AND THE ROUND OF 16.
YOU1000000109_S0000011	CRISTIANO FACES THE NATION HE HAS JUST SPENT THE LAST NINE YEARS PLYING HIS TRADE IN, SPAIN.
YOU1000000109_S0000012	I THINK THAT DEFINITELY MOTIVATED RONALDO HIMSELF. A LOT OF THOSE PLAYERS WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS TEAMMATES, OF COURSE, LIKE REAL MADRID.
YOU1000000109_S0000013	HE REALLY WANTED TO LEAVE EVERYTHING ON THE FIELD AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW.
YOU1000000109_S0000015	RONALDO, IS THAT A PENALTY? IT IS!
YOU1000000109_S0000016	IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR CR7 TO MAKE HIS MARCH.
YOU1000000109_S0000017	INSIDE THE OPENING THREE MINUTES CRISTIANO RONALDO FOULED IN THE PENALTY AREA.
YOU1000000109_S0000018	CRISTIANO NOW HAS THE CHANCE TO SCORE FOR HIS COUNTRY FROM THE PENALTY SPOT. HE'S BEEN HERE BEFORE.
YOU1000000109_S0000021	21 YEAR OLD CRISTIANO RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000023	WAITS FOR REFEREE POULARD'S WHISTLE. COMPOSES HIMSELF.
YOU1000000109_S0000025	AND SCORES!
YOU1000000109_S0000027	HE HAD BEEN AT THE EUROS TWO YEARS PRIOR AND THEY MADE IT TO THE FINALS LOSING OUT TO GREECE.
YOU1000000109_S0000028	HE WAS ALREADY ARGUABLY PORTUGAL'S MOST POTENT ATTACKING WEAPON AND THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD PORTUGAL TEAM.
YOU1000000109_S0000029	THE EARLY NOUGHTIES TEAM THAT RONALDO FOUND HIMSELF PART OF WAS A PHENOMENAL TEAM IN TERMS OF TALENT.
YOU1000000109_S0000030	ONE REASON WHY RONALDO DID WELL AT THAT TOURNAMENT, HE WASN'T PORTUGAL'S SOLE FOCUS POINT.
YOU1000000109_S0000031	YOU HAD SIMÃO SOBROSA, WHO WAS DOING VERY WELL, OF COURSE YOU HAD LUIZ FIGO, YOU HAD DECO.
YOU1000000109_S0000032	THE NETHERLANDS GAME IN THE LAST 16 WAS OBVIOUSLY A BRUTAL EXPERIENCE FOR RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000033	THE NETHERLANDS TRIED TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THE GAME, TAKE HIM OUT OF THE EQUATION AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID, AN ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS TACKLE.
YOU1000000109_S0000034	THAT WAS A VERY SCANDALOUS GAME WHERE YOU HAD 16 YELLOW CARDS, YOU HAD FOUR RED CARDS. I MEAN, THAT WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT GAME FOR BOTH TEAMS. FOR CRISTIANO, THAT WAS A LEARNING MOMENT.
YOU1000000109_S0000035	AS YOU GOT OLDER AND YOU GOT FITTER AND MORE MUSCULAR IF YOU LIKE, STRONGER, THAT WAS PROBABLY A GAME YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RIDE MORE.
YOU1000000109_S0000036	IT WAS MORE WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT GAME AGAINST ENGLAND THAT TOOK ALL THE HEADLINES.
YOU1000000109_S0000037	THERE IS THIS PHOTO OF RONY AGAINST RICARDO CARVALHO.
YOU1000000109_S0000038	AND ROONEY AND ALL THE ENGLISH TEAM SAID THAT CRISTIANO SHOULD GO TO THE REFEREE TO SAY GIVE HIM A RED CARD.
YOU1000000109_S0000039	AND THEN HE'S WALKING OVER TO THE BENCH, HE GIVES A NICE LITTLE WINK, AND OF COURSE, EVERYBODY IN ENGLAND, UNDERSTANDABLY, WAS VERY UPSET.
YOU1000000109_S0000040	I MEAN, DEFINITELY I THINK WAS AN EARLY SIGN OF WHAT WAS TO COME OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN TERMS OF CRISTIANO RONALDO AND HIS PERSONALITY.
YOU1000000109_S0000041	THE ENGLAND GAME ACTUALLY ENDED PERFECTLY FOR RONALDO DESPITE ALL HIS CONTROVERSY AS HE TOOK THE WINNING PENALTY IN THE SHOOTOUT.
YOU1000000109_S0000043	IT'S ALL OVER FOR ENGLAND, PORTUGAL GO INTO THE LAST FOUR.
YOU1000000109_S0000044	THEY OVERCAME THEM ON PENALTIES AND THEN LOST TO A FRENCH TEAM AS INSPIRED BY ZINEDINE ZIDANE. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY EXCEPTIONAL IN THAT GAME.
YOU1000000109_S0000045	AND IT'S HIS WORLD CUP AT THE MOMENT, ZINEDINE ZIDANE.
YOU1000000109_S0000046	PORTUGAL TRIED TO GET BACK INTO IT. THEY WERE QUITE CLOSE ON A FEW OCCASIONS.
YOU1000000109_S0000047	GOES FOR GOAL, BARTOSZ CAN'T HOLD IT. OH, WHAT A CHANCE MISSED.
YOU1000000109_S0000048	THAT JUST WASN'T TO BE.
YOU1000000109_S0000050	CRISTIANO RONALDO AGAINST DAVID DE GEA
YOU1000000109_S0000051	IT'S 1 0 PORTUGAL AND WAS THERE EVER ANY DOUBT? IT JUST HAD TO BE HIM.
YOU1000000109_S0000052	PORTUGAL'S LEAD ONLY LASTS 20 MINUTES.
YOU1000000109_S0000053	PEPE GETS THE HEAD UP AND GOES DOWN, PLAY CONTINUES, IT'S DIEGO COSTA, CAN HE GET THE SHOT AWAY? COSTA SCORES!
YOU1000000109_S0000055	WELL, RONALDO'S MENTALITY, ISN'T IT? I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM THE PLAYER HE IS.
YOU1000000109_S0000056	JUST BEFORE HALF TIME, CRISTIANO HAS SLIPPED THE BALL ON THE EDGE OF THE BOX.
YOU1000000109_S0000057	RONALDO WITH THE SHOT, OH IT'S GONE IN! AN ERROR FROM DAVID DE GEA AND CRISTIANO RONALDO GETS PORTUGAL'S SECOND GOAL OF THE NIGHT.
YOU1000000109_S0000058	PORTUGAL ARE BACK IN FRONT. TONIGHT, CRISTIANO IS ON A MISSION AGAINST SPAIN, PERHAPS MOTIVATED BY REVENGE FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST.
YOU1000000109_S0000062	THE RONALDO OF 2010 IS A VERY, VERY DIFFERENT RONALDO TO THE RONALDO OF 2006.
YOU1000000109_S0000063	BETWEEN THOSE TWO WORLD CUPS, HE SIGNS FOR REAL MADRID, HE BECOMES THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLAYER TO SIGN FOR THE CLUB AND IN THE WORLD AT THAT POINT IN TIME FOR 94 MILLION EUROS.
YOU1000000109_S0000064	AND AT THAT POINT HE HAD BECOME THE LEADER AND THE CAPTAIN OF PORTUGAL.
YOU1000000109_S0000065	WITH A ROOM AND WHISTLE TO TURN FOR RONALDO, MADE ROOM FOR THE SHOT! OH, OFF THE POST! WHAT A STRIKE.
YOU1000000109_S0000066	HE HAD A DIFFERENT MANAGER TO PLAY UNDER. FIRST, HE HAD DIFFERENT TEAMMATES. ARGUABLY THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD AFTER WINNING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE WITH MANCHESTER UNITED. THE ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO HIM MUCH MORE THAN BEFORE.
YOU1000000109_S0000067	HERE'S RONALDO, NO FREE KICK.
YOU1000000109_S0000068	CARLOS QUEIROZ, THE COACH, HAD COME IN AND FORTUNATELY FOR PORTUGAL IT ALL WENT HORRIBLY WRONG. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RONALDO AND QUEIROZ WAS VERY STRAINED.
YOU1000000109_S0000069	AND I THINK THAT REALLY STEMMED FROM THE TACTICS EMPLOYED BY K. RAJ.
YOU1000000109_S0000070	HIS WHOLE TACTICS SEEMED TO BE, LET'S JUST MAKE OUR TEAM AS DIFFICULT TO SCORE AGAINST AS POSSIBLE AND OUR ATTACKING SISTER WOULD JUST BE, WHACK THE BALL UP TO RONALDO AND LET HIM WORK SOME MAGIC ON HIS OWN.
YOU1000000109_S0000071	AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK AT ALL.
YOU1000000109_S0000072	GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR BRAZIL TO CONCEDE.
YOU1000000109_S0000073	AND HE SCORED ONCE DURING THAT TOURNAMENT. IT WILL BE AN EXCELLENT GOAL AGAINST NORTH KOREA WHERE HE'S SORT OF JUGGLING OUT, WHERE HE BALANCED THE BALL ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND SORT OF ROLLED IT OVER THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND THEN SCORED.
YOU1000000109_S0000074	AND THEN IT WAS THE DERBY, THE IBERIAN DERBY.
YOU1000000109_S0000075	AND THEY GOT KNOCKED OUT TO SPAIN, WHO, AT LEAST FOR THEM, A BIT OF COMFORT IS KNOWING THAT THEY WENT ON TO WIN THE WHOLE TOURNAMENT ALTOGETHER.
YOU1000000109_S0000076	AND THEY WERE A FABULOUS SPANISH SIDE. NOBODY REALLY COULD TAKE THEM APART. NOBODY COULD REALLY BEAT THEM AT ALL.
YOU1000000109_S0000077	IT'S TRUE THAT SPAIN HAVE A BEAUTIFUL TEAM AT THIS TIME.
YOU1000000109_S0000078	I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON CRISTIANO RONALDO TO BE THIS BIG FIGURE SINCE HE WAS THIS WORLDWIDE SUPERSTAR, BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE CAME UP AGAINST
YOU1000000109_S0000079	THIS SPANISH WALL THAT HE JUST WASN'T ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH.
YOU1000000109_S0000080	AFTER THE GAME, RONALDO WAS ASKED WHAT WENT WRONG AND TOLD THE GERMANS TO ASK CARLOS
YOU1000000109_S0000081	I THINK IT'S ONE WORLD CUP WHICH YOU CAN'T REALLY BLAME HIM AT ALL FOR HIS LACK OF PRODUCTION. IT WAS DEFINITELY JUST THE TEAM WASN'T SET UP TO GET THE BEST OUT OF HIM AT ALL.
YOU1000000109_S0000082	THE WORLD CUP DISAPPOINTING IN THE FINISH, DISAPPOINTING IN NOT SCORING THE GOALS THAT PEOPLE EXPECTED HIM TO SCORE, BUT IT WAS THE FOUNDATION FOR HIM AS A PLAYER TO IMPROVE ON AND BUILD.
YOU1000000109_S0000084	RONALDO WITH THE SHOT, OH IT'S GONE IN!
YOU1000000109_S0000085	EIGHT YEARS LATER AND PORTUGAL ARE NOW THE ONES WITH THE UPPER HAND. THEY LEAD 2 1 WITH 45 MINUTES LEFT ON THE CLOCK.
YOU1000000109_S0000086	CRISTIANO RONALDO HAS TURNED THIS GROUP MATCH BACK IN PORTUGAL'S FAVOUR.
YOU1000000109_S0000087	WITH SPAIN APPLYING MORE PRESSURE, THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH CRISTIANO CAN DO EXCEPT HOPE HIS DEFENCE WILL HOLD FIRM.
YOU1000000109_S0000088	SILVA WITH A LITTLE CHIP. BACK ACROSS, GOAL TURNED IN! DIEGO COSTA STRIKES AGAIN!
YOU1000000109_S0000089	A SIMPLE FREE KICK MOVE FROM SPAIN AND FOR THE SECOND TIME TONIGHT IN SOCHI, SPAIN HAVE EQUALIZED.
YOU1000000109_S0000090	BUT THEN THERE'S NOT MUCH THE DEFENCE CAN DO WHEN THE BALL FALLS TO NACHO.
YOU1000000109_S0000091	NOW IT MIGHT DROP FOR THE SHOT HERE. OH, WHAT A SHOT THAT IS! NACHO, THE MAN WHO GAVE AWAY THE PENALTY EARLY ON IN THIS MATCH.
YOU1000000109_S0000093	HAS REDEEMED HIMSELF IN STYLE
YOU1000000109_S0000094	THANKS TO A WONDER STRIKE, SPAIN HAVE TURNED THE GAME AROUND. THEY NOW LEAD 3 2 AND IT LOOKS LIKE HISTORY IS SET TO REPEAT ITSELF.
YOU1000000109_S0000095	IT SEEMS CRISTIANO CAN'T SHAKE HIS BAD LUCK AT THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000109_S0000097	GERMANY LEAD. THE HEIGHT OF HUMMELS, THE GOAL OF HUMMELS. GERMANY GET ANOTHER ONE, AND THEY DO. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE DEFENDING. GERMANY HAVE GOT FOUR.
YOU1000000109_S0000098	WHAT A DREADFUL DAY AND AN AWFUL START FOR PORTUGAL.
YOU1000000109_S0000099	SO IN THE WAY THAT RONALDO HAD PROGRESSED QUITE A LOT BETWEEN 2006 AND 2010, HE PROGRESSED EQUALLY A FAR DISTANCE BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014. HE WENT INTO THAT TOURNAMENT A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE WINNER WITH REAL MADRID, BALLON D'OR WINNER,
YOU1000000109_S0000100	IT WAS NOT A GREAT TOURNAMENT. HE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS, PHYSICAL PROBLEMS, BUT HE WANTED TO STAY, HE WANTED TO BE THERE.
YOU1000000109_S0000101	SO HE DECIDED TO PLAY THROUGH THE PAIN AND TO PLAY THROUGH THE INJURY.
YOU1000000109_S0000102	BECAUSE HE FELT THAT WITHOUT HIM, THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE. BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER IN THE END BECAUSE IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT.
YOU1000000109_S0000103	GERMANY WERE PHENOMENAL IN 2014, OBVIOUSLY WENT ON TO WIN THE TOURNAMENT, BUT NEVERTHELESS TO GET BEAT 4 0, IT WAS PORTUGAL'S HEAVIEST DEFEAT AT A WORLD CUP, THAT WAS PRETTY HUMILIATING.
YOU1000000109_S0000104	PORTUGAL WERE REALLY RONALDO CENTRIC AT THIS TIME.
YOU1000000109_S0000105	AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, THAT DEFENSE, THEY REALLY PUT A CLAMP DOWN AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM.
YOU1000000109_S0000106	YEDLIN WITH THE BALL IN, BRADLEY! CHANCE FOR HIM, USA! AND IT'S A GOAL!
YOU1000000109_S0000107	IT WAS QUITE AMAZING ACTUALLY THAT RONALDO MANAGED TO PULL OUT OF THE BAG A CHANCE TO KEEP THEIR WORLD CUP ALIVE JUST BY THE SLIMMEST OF THREADS. VIRGIL THE LAST KICK OF THE GAME.
YOU1000000109_S0000109	UNLESS WE HAVE A MOST DRAMATIC TWIST IN THE FINAL SECONDS NOW, INTO THE LAST 30! OH, AND WE HAVE! IT'S A DREAM OF A CROSS FROM RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000110	AND VARELA BURIES IT.
YOU1000000109_S0000111	HE WAS GOING TO PLAY UNTIL THE LAST WHISTLE OF EVERY GAME. THAT'S HIS MENTALITY. THAT IS WHAT HE DRIVES FOR. HE'S NOT GOING TO REST.
YOU1000000109_S0000112	I THINK HE FIGURES, YOU KNOW, EVEN IF I HAVE, YOU KNOW, MY LEG AMPUTATED, I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND I'M GOING TO STILL TRY AND SCORE OR AT LEAST SET SOMEBODY ELSE UP TO SCORE.
YOU1000000109_S0000113	BECAUSE HE'S JUST THAT FOCUSED AND THAT DETERMINED.
YOU1000000109_S0000114	THE LAST GAME AGAINST GHANA, ALL SORTS OF PERMUTATIONS, PORTUGAL WAS STILL IN THE SHOUTER QUALIFYING, BUT BASICALLY THEY NEEDED TO WIN AND WIN BIG.
YOU1000000109_S0000115	RONALDO MANAGED TO SCORE THE GOAL BUT IT WAS ALREADY QUITE NEAR TOWARDS THE END OF THE GAME.
YOU1000000109_S0000116	MAYBE THERE, RONALDO, YES! HE HAS GOAL, NO. 50 OF HIS INTERNATIONAL CAREER.
YOU1000000109_S0000117	IT WAS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE AT THAT POINT AND THE DAMAGE WAS DONE AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE GROUP AND THEY CRASHED OUT VERY EARLY ON IN THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000109_S0000118	IN A VERY DISAPPOINTING WORLD CUP FOR PORTUGAL, HE WAS PROBABLY PORTUGAL'S BEST PLAYER.
YOU1000000109_S0000119	IT WAS PROBABLY AT THAT MOMENT MAYBE THAT THE GAP BETWEEN PORTUGAL'S BEST PLAYER, I.E. RONALDO, AND THE REST OF THE TEAM WAS MOST EXPOSED.
YOU1000000109_S0000120	IT'S DEFINITELY A WORLD CUP WHERE PORTUGAL PAID A PRICE FOR JUST NOT BEING FIT ENOUGH.
YOU1000000109_S0000122	RONALDO GOES DOWN, GETS A FREE KICK CHALLENGES BY PIQUE NOW THIS IS A KEY MOMENT WE KNOW WHO'S GOING TO STRIKE IT
YOU1000000109_S0000123	THE GAME APPROACHES ITS FINAL MINUTES. CRISTIANO STANDS OVER A FREE KICK, DISPLAYING HIS TRADEMARK STANCE.
YOU1000000109_S0000124	THIS FOR HIS HAT TRICK AND TO SAVE PORTUGAL FROM DEFEAT.
YOU1000000109_S0000126	RONALDO
YOU1000000109_S0000128	OH, GENIUS! ABSOLUTE GENIUS! WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
YOU1000000109_S0000129	IT WAS A PHENOMENAL TOUR. EVERYBODY AT THAT POINT JUST KIND OF FELL OUT OF THEIR SEATS AND SAID, OK, IT'S NOT SPAIN'S DAY. WE JUST NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT CRISTIANO RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000130	YOU DON'T SEE THOSE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCES IN THE WORLD CUP THAT OFTEN.
YOU1000000109_S0000131	IT ACTUALLY SUMS UP RONALDO. BRILLIANT GOAL, SCORED IN A HUGE GAME AT A CRITICAL MOMENT.
YOU1000000109_S0000132	EXEMPLARY. PERFECTION. AND IT'S A HAT TRICK FOR CRISTIANO RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000134	IN THEIR NEXT GAME AGAINST MOROCCO, CRISTIANO'S FINE FORM CONTINUES AS HE SCORES THE DECISIVE GOAL IN A PROMISING PERFORMANCE.
YOU1000000109_S0000136	HE IS A SENSATION!
YOU1000000109_S0000138	HE WOULD BE HIS 85TH GOAL IN THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE. HE WOULD PASS FERENC PUSKAS.
YOU1000000109_S0000139	AND SO HE THEN BECAME THE HIGHEST GOAL SCORER IN EUROPE IN INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL AND THE SECOND OVERALL IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000109_S0000140	AGAINST IR IRAN, A QUARESMA WONDER GOAL PUTS PORTUGAL AHEAD.
YOU1000000109_S0000141	WAS CRISTIANO'S WORLD CUP LUCK TURNING AT LAST?
YOU1000000109_S0000142	THIS WILL GIVE PORTUGAL BREATHING SPACE.
YOU1000000109_S0000144	RONALDO IS DENIED
YOU1000000109_S0000146	AND THE GAME AND THE GROUP ARE STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.
YOU1000000109_S0000147	CRISTIANO'S MISSED PENALTY ULTIMATELY COSTS PORTUGAL THE TOP SPOT IN THEIR GROUP.
YOU1000000109_S0000148	WHICH MEANS THEY'LL FACE URUGUAY IN THE ROUND OF 16, A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.
YOU1000000109_S0000149	ROUND OF 16 THEY RUN INTO UDAWAI WHICH IS A TOUGH MATCHUP BECAUSE THEIR DEFENSE IS GEARED, IT'S VERY PHYSICAL. REALLY CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR CRISTIANO RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000150	WALL WAS ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CONSIDERABLE THREAT. NOT HIS FINEST HOUR FROM A FREE KICK. SUAREZ OVER ON THAT FAR SIDE AND IT'S PINPOINT.
YOU1000000109_S0000152	DANGEROUS CROSS GIVEN! IT'S THEM AGAIN!
YOU1000000109_S0000153	UNFORTUNATELY FOR PORTUGAL, THEY REALLY ONLY GOT GOING IN THE SECOND HALF WHEN THEY WERE REALLY BACKS AGAINST THE WALL.
YOU1000000109_S0000154	ADRIAN SILVA'S SHOT, THE DEFLECTION FOR A CORNER.
YOU1000000109_S0000155	PEPE! HAS DONE IT!
YOU1000000109_S0000157	WELL THERE'S THE ANSWER THEY WERE LOOKING FOR!
YOU1000000109_S0000159	BUT THEY REALLY DIDN'T DO THEMSELVES JUSTICE AND I THINK JURONG GWAII WERE DESERVED WINNERS AT THE END, TWO BRILLIANT GOALS YOU HAVE TO SAY.
YOU1000000109_S0000160	FERNANDES, FOUR ON THREE FOR A MOMENT HERE, CAVANI! BRILLIANT! THAT IS PURE GOLD.
YOU1000000109_S0000161	FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN HIS CAREER, CRISTIANO RONALDO IS KNOCKED OUT OF THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000109_S0000162	IT'S ALL OVER! AND MAYBE IT IS THE END IN TERMS OF WORLD CUPS FOR THE GREAT CRISTIANO RONALDO.
YOU1000000109_S0000163	IN THAT WORLD CUP, HE SHOWED ONE LAST TIME, IF IT IS THE LAST TIME, THAT HE IS SUCH A PROLIFIC GOAL SCORER THAT IS LEGENDARY.
YOU1000000109_S0000164	I THINK 2018 IN A WAY SUMS UP RONALDO'S INTERNATIONAL CAREER, WHICH IS EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED, A PLAYER FOR THE BIG OCCASION, BUT JUST PART OF A TEAM THAT BAR FRANCE IN 2016 HAS NEVER BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN ONE OF THE MAJOR HONOURS.
YOU1000000109_S0000165	WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE HIS LAST WORLD CUP. I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE. I THINK THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE COULD SEE HIM AT QATAR 2022. HE'LL BE 37 YEARS OLD.
YOU1000000109_S0000166	BY THE TIME THAT WILL CUT ROLLS AROUND.
YOU1000000109_S0000168	RONALDO WILL NOT BE PORTUGAL'S SOLE ATTACKING THREAT, SO YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE STAGE IS PERFECTLY SET FOR HIM AS HE REALLY THRIVES IN THIS WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000109_S0000169	AS PART OF AN EXCITING ATTACKING TEAM, AS THE ELDER STATESMAN, AND PERHAPS PUT THOSE FORMER WORLD CUPS WHERE HE DIDN'T PERHAPS DO HIMSELF JUSTICE, YOU KNOW, PUT THAT TO RIGHTS.
YOU1000000110_S0000002	AND NOBODY IN HIS LIFE, ALL FORCE, ALL WILL, NOW FOR THE NETHERLANDS.
YOU1000000110_S0000003	SAVED BY ROMERO!
YOU1000000110_S0000005	AND WHO HAVE ARGENTINA SENT UP FIRST? OF COURSE, LIONEL MESSI.
YOU1000000110_S0000007	THE MAN FOR ALL MOMENTS.
YOU1000000110_S0000009	FOR MANY, ON PLANET FOOTBALL, THE NUMBER ONE. THE MAN.
YOU1000000110_S0000011	THE 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP BRAZIL WAS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOURNAMENT IN LIONEL MESSI'S CAREER.
YOU1000000110_S0000013	SO 2014, THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF EXPECTATION FOR THIS PLAYER WHO HAD BEEN BREAKING ALL SORTS OF GOAL SCORING RECORDS AT CLUB LEVEL.
YOU1000000110_S0000014	BUT NEVER TRULY EXCELLED AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
YOU1000000110_S0000017	MESSI MADE SURE THAT THEIR FIRST MATCH AGAINST BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA WENT TO PLAN.
YOU1000000110_S0000018	LIKEWISE CAMPAGNOLO. IT'S A DEVILISH DELIVERY, IT'S IN! THE ARGENTINES HAVE BROKEN THROUGH.
YOU1000000110_S0000021	MESSI KEPT GOING. IT'S LIONEL MESSI! HE SCORES!
YOU1000000110_S0000023	IN A WIN FOR ARGENTINA WHERE THEY LOOK SOLID AND SET UP THE TOURNAMENT REALLY FOR THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY COULD GO A LONG WAY.
YOU1000000110_S0000025	HOWEVER, THE NEXT GAME AGAINST MINNOW'S IRAN WASN'T QUITE SO STRAIGHTFORWARD.
YOU1000000110_S0000026	ARGENTINA, THE TOP TEAM IN SOUTH AMERICAN QUALIFYING AGAINST IRAN.
YOU1000000110_S0000027	IT WAS A TOUGH GAME FOR ARGENTINA BECAUSE IRAN DEFENDED REALLY WELL. ARGENTINA DIDN'T HAVE THAT MANY CHANCES DURING THE GAME.
YOU1000000110_S0000028	THIS IS NOT ARGENTINA'S DAY SO FAR.
YOU1000000110_S0000029	A WIN WOULD SEND ARGENTINA THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND. AND WITH SECONDS LEFT, NO ONE KNEW THAT BETTER THAN THEIR CAPTAIN.
YOU1000000110_S0000030	HE'LL GO FOR GOAL... OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME! IF ONE MAN COULD WIN A FOOTBALL MATCH, IT WOULD BE LIONEL MESSI.
YOU1000000110_S0000031	MESSI PRODUCED MAYBE HIS MOST SPECTACULAR INDIVIDUAL MOMENT AT A WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000110_S0000032	CLASSIC MESSAGE, WE'VE SEEN HIM DO IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN.
YOU1000000110_S0000033	MESSI, AN UNBELIEVABLY TALENTED PLAYER, LEADING HIS COUNTRY TO VICTORY.
YOU1000000110_S0000034	THE PROPHECY THAT HAD BEEN MADE ABOUT A WONDER KID MANY YEARS AGO WAS NOW BEING FULFILLED.
YOU1000000110_S0000036	IT WAS REALLY AT YOUTH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH ARGENTINA WHEN HE BURST INTO PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS.
YOU1000000110_S0000037	HE WAS THE ABSOLUTE STAR OF THAT TOURNAMENT. HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T START THE TOURNAMENT IN THE TEAM.
YOU1000000110_S0000038	IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THE KIND OF PLAYER HE WAS, THE WAY THAT HE WAS AT TIMES HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE ON PITCH.
YOU1000000110_S0000039	I KNOW SO. MESSI AGAIN. OH, THAT WAS BRILLIANTLY DONE AND WHAT A FANTASTIC GOAL THAT WAS BY LIONEL MESSI.
YOU1000000110_S0000040	IN THE SEMI FINAL AGAINST BRAZIL, HE SCORED FROM OUTSIDE THE BOX EARLY ON, A THUNDEROUS SHOT INTO THE TOP CORNER.
YOU1000000110_S0000041	WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY START BY ONE OF THE PLAYERS OF THE TOURNAMENT, LIONEL MESSI.
YOU1000000110_S0000042	AND THAT TOOK THEM INTO THE FINAL AND AGAIN, MESSI WAS THE HERO IN THE FINAL. HE SCORED BOTH GOALS IN A 2 1 WIN OVER NIGERIA AND THEY WERE CHAMPIONS.
YOU1000000110_S0000043	THAT'S HIS PENALTY! HE SCORES.
YOU1000000110_S0000044	BEING THE STAR PLAYER, HE WAS THE MAIN PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT, HE WAS THE LEADING SCORER.
YOU1000000110_S0000046	ARGENTINA'S TROPHY, IT'S A FIFTH WORLD CROWN.
YOU1000000110_S0000047	THAT TOURNAMENT, THAT FEW WEEKS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHEN THE WORLD KNEW WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL PLAYER IN OUR HOUSE.
YOU1000000110_S0000048	I THINK WITHIN ARGENTINA IT WAS QUITE A CLAMOUR FOR HIM TO BE IN THE SQUAD FOR 2006. THERE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST WHEN HE CAME OFF THE BENCH AGAINST SERBIA IN THE GROUP GAME.
YOU1000000110_S0000049	AND LIONEL MESSI BECOMES THE YOUNGEST ARGENTINE PLAYER TO PLAY AT A WORLD CUP SINCE 1934.
YOU1000000110_S0000052	IT'S MESSI, HE JUST HAD TO SCORE.
YOU1000000110_S0000053	I FELT LIKE THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE PERFECT START TO THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000110_S0000055	THE HERO OF ARGENTINA, THE PLAYER THEY'VE CLAMOURED FOR TO BE INCLUDED AS SCORER 6.
YOU1000000110_S0000056	IT DOESN'T HAVE A HAPPY ENDING IN 2006 AND IT COULD HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY PLAY GERMANY IN THE QUARTERFINALS, THE GAME GOES TO PENALTIES AND LEO MESSI IS LEFT ON THE BENCH.
YOU1000000110_S0000059	AGAIN BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND HIS CONTROL, HE WAS LEFT WATCHING FROM THE SIDELINES IN THE DECISIVE MOMENT AND HIS TEAM SEIZED HIM.
YOU1000000110_S0000062	LEO MESSI'S CAREER COULD HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY DIFFERENT HAD HE PLAYED AGAINST GERMANY.
YOU1000000110_S0000064	THOUGH ALREADY QUALIFIED, TOPPING THE GROUP WOULD MEAN AN EASIER ROUTE TO THE FINAL AND A BETTER CHANCE AT LIFTING THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000110_S0000065	IT WAS NIGERIA THEY NEEDED TO BEAT AND WITH HIS SIGHTS SET ON LIFTING THAT COVETED TROPHY, SO BEGAN THE MESSY SHOW.
YOU1000000110_S0000066	THE THIRD GROUP GAME WAS ON THE BACK OF MESSI. HE SCORED THE OPENING GOAL VERY EARLY ON.
YOU1000000110_S0000067	THE FIRST ONE ABSOLUTELY HAMMERS IT INTO THE WALL AND THERE'S NO STOPPING IT.
YOU1000000110_S0000068	WHO WAS GONNA GET THERE FIRST? MESSI WAS.
YOU1000000110_S0000069	NIGERIA WEREN'T AN EASY TEAM TO PLAY AGAINST, HAD A LOT OF ATTACKING TALENT. HIS SECOND GOAL AGAINST NIGERIA IS A STUNNING FREE KICK.
YOU1000000110_S0000070	EXTRAORDINARY! JUST EVERYTHING YOU WANT FROM A FREE KICK.
YOU1000000110_S0000071	ARGENTINA CAME AWAY WITH THE 3 2 WIN ON THE BACK OF TWO MESSY GOALS.
YOU1000000110_S0000072	SO HERE HE WAS HEADING INTO THE KNOCKOUT STAGES HAVING ARGENTINA 1 3, OUT OF THREE, LOOKING LIKE A TEAM THAT COULD GO ALL THE WAY.
YOU1000000110_S0000074	AGAINST SWITZERLAND, LA ALBI CELESTE ONCE AGAIN STRUGGLED TO FIND A WAY THROUGH AGAINST A TOUGH OPPONENT.
YOU1000000110_S0000075	GAME SEVEN OF THE ROUND OF 16.
YOU1000000110_S0000076	OPPOSITION, STANDABLY INTENT ON TRYING TO STOP MESSI. HE WAS A MAN IN FORM AND A MAN INTENT ON TAKING ARGENTINA ALL THE WAY. SWITZERLAND, TOUGH OPPONENTS, NOT MUCH IN THE GAME.
YOU1000000110_S0000077	LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO GO TO PENALTIES.
YOU1000000110_S0000078	THIS TIME MESSI WOULD LEAVE IT RIGHT UP UNTIL THE 118TH MINUTE BEFORE MAKING THE DIFFERENCE.
YOU1000000110_S0000080	ARGENTINA! AND HOW ARGENTINA HAVE PUNISHED THEM.
YOU1000000110_S0000081	JUST BEFORE THE DREADED PENALTY SHOOTOUT ARGENTINA HAD FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE LAST EIGHT.
YOU1000000110_S0000082	AND ARGENTINA NOW SURELY ARE SAFELY THROUGH TO THE QUARTER FINALS.
YOU1000000110_S0000083	AGAINST BELGIUM, IT WOULD BE QUITE THE OPPOSITE, WITH MESSI CAPITALISING ON A MISTAKE IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES.
YOU1000000110_S0000084	THEY STARTED OFF SUPERBLY IN WAY WITH THE GOAL.
YOU1000000110_S0000085	ARGENTINA WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAD THIS COLLECTIVE STRUCTURE WHICH THEY'VE BEEN LACKING IN THE PAST, THAT IT WASN'T JUST A ONE MAN TEAM AND THAT IF THEY GOT AHEAD...
YOU1000000110_S0000086	THEY COULD DEFEND FOR THE REST OF THE GAME AND CLOSE OUT A GAME TO WIN IT 1 0, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.
YOU1000000110_S0000087	HE'S INTO THE AREA TO HIGUAÍN! GOAL! ARGENTINA SCORE IN THE EIGHTH MINUTE OF THE GAME, AND IT IS GONZALO HIGUAÍN!
YOU1000000110_S0000088	MESSI'S MEN HELD FIRM TO WIN THE MATCH. HE HAD NOW DONE WHAT NO ARGENTINIAN CAPTAIN HAD MANAGED IN THE PAST 24 YEARS.
YOU1000000110_S0000089	HAD LED HIS COUNTRY TO THE SEMI FINALS. MESSI WAS FINALLY IN THE LAST FOUR.
YOU1000000110_S0000090	ALTHOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN EASY, THERE HAD BEEN MUCH PAIN ALONG THE WAY.
YOU1000000110_S0000092	BY THE TIME THE NEXT WORLD CUP ROLLED AROUND IN 2010 IN SOUTH AFRICA, HE WAS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000110_S0000093	IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY. WOULD MARADONA BE ABLE TO LEAD MESSI TO THE TITLE? WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM NEARLY EVERY GAME, MESSI'S INVOLVED IN ALMOST EVERYTHING, BUT HE DOESN'T SCORE.
YOU1000000110_S0000095	AND ULTIMATELY WAS UNABLE TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AGAINST GERMANY.
YOU1000000110_S0000097	THE TEAM SYSTEM WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IT NEVER LOOKED CONVINCING.
YOU1000000110_S0000098	AGAIN, GERMANY, JUST AS IT HAD BEEN IN 2006 WITH THE TEAM THAT PUT THEM TO THE SWORD, BUT THIS TIME IN A FAR MORE CONVINCING WAY.
YOU1000000110_S0000099	FROM THE OPENING WHISTLE YOU COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT ANYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OTHER THAN THE GERMANY VICTORY.
YOU1000000110_S0000100	AND THEY'RE QUEUING UP AGAIN HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE PUT ON THE PLATE.
YOU1000000110_S0000101	I THINK HE ENDS UP TAKING A LOT OF THE BLAME FOR ARGENTINA'S DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE.
YOU1000000110_S0000102	DEEPLY FRUSTRATING FOR MESSI BECAUSE HE CAME AWAY FROM THAT TOURNAMENT KNOWING THAT HE HADN'T PLAYED PARTICULARLY WELL BUT ALSO KNOWING THAT HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE CHANCE TO BECAUSE THE WAY THE TEAM WAS STRUCTURED JUST DIDN'T ALLOW IT.
YOU1000000110_S0000103	WHAT WILL BE REGARDED AS A DAY OF DISASTER FOR ARGENTINA. ARGENTINA NIL, GERMANY FOUR.
YOU1000000110_S0000106	ARGENTINA, THE LAST SOUTH AMERICAN STANDING IN BRAZIL. WHICH OF THESE WILL MEET IT AT THE MARACANÃ?
YOU1000000110_S0000107	THE SEMI FINAL. NEITHER ARGENTINA NOR THE NETHERLANDS HAVE MANAGED TO SCORE AFTER 120 MINUTES.
YOU1000000110_S0000108	THE TEAM THAT MAKES THE WORLD CUP FINAL WILL NOW BE DECIDED ON PENALTIES.
YOU1000000110_S0000110	WHO FANCIES IT? WHO FANCIES IT, BOYS? IT IS THE DUTCH FIRST.
YOU1000000110_S0000112	AND IT IS BIG RON VLAAR. WHAT A MOMENT IN HIS LIFE. ALL FORCE, ALL WILL. VLAAR FOR THE NETHERLANDS.
YOU1000000110_S0000113	SAVED BY ROMERO!
YOU1000000110_S0000114	THE NETHERLANDS WAS AGAIN A VERY TOUGH, TIGHT GAME.
YOU1000000110_S0000115	THIS IS WHEN KEEPERS COME ALIVE.
YOU1000000110_S0000117	AND WHO HAVE ARGENTINA SENT UP FIRST? OF COURSE, LIONEL MESSI, THE MAN FOR ALL MOMENTS.
YOU1000000110_S0000119	FOR MANY ON PLANET FOOTBALL, THE NUMBER ONE, THE MAN.
YOU1000000110_S0000121	MESSI FOR SURE!
YOU1000000110_S0000122	THE CAPTAIN LEADS BY EXAMPLE, SCORING HIS PENALTY.
YOU1000000110_S0000123	THERE IS NO OCCASION TOO BIG.
YOU1000000110_S0000124	ABSORBING MESSI'S CONFIDENCE, ARGENTINA THEN PROCEED TO SCORE THEIR NEXT TWO SPOT KICKS.
YOU1000000110_S0000126	WESLEY STEINER, OH WHAT A SAVE! WHAT A SAVE!
YOU1000000110_S0000127	IT ALL COMES DOWN TO MAXI RODRIGUEZ, A PLAYER FROM MESSI'S HOMETOWN.
YOU1000000110_S0000128	WITH THIS HIGHLY CHARGED MOMENT. IT'S IN! AND ARGENTINA...
YOU1000000110_S0000129	A REAL BOUNCE!
YOU1000000110_S0000132	ARGENTINA ARE SET ON CAPTURING THE BIG ONE ON BRAZILIAN SOIL.
YOU1000000110_S0000133	NOW ONLY ONE TEAM STOOD BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND THE TROPHY, AND IT WAS A FAMILIAR FOE.
YOU1000000110_S0000134	YOU DON'T NEED MORE MOTIVATION WHEN YOU'RE IN A WORLD CUP FINAL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM BEAT US AGAIN.
YOU1000000110_S0000135	YOU HAD THE FEELING THAT THIS IS THEIR YEAR, THIS IS MISSES, OPPORTUNITY.
YOU1000000110_S0000136	MESSI'S ARGENTINA WOULD FACE GERMANY ONCE AGAIN.
YOU1000000110_S0000139	GERMANY AND ARGENTINA, PERHAPS PLANET FOOTBALL'S GREATEST INTERCONTINENTAL RIVALRY.
YOU1000000110_S0000141	THERE ARE THREE KEY MOMENTS I REMEMBER REALLY IN THAT FINAL FROM MESSI'S POINT OF VIEW. ONE WAS WHEN A MISTAKE BY GERMANY SENT GONZALO HIGUAIN CLEAN THROUGH ON GOAL.
YOU1000000110_S0000142	THAT MOMENT WAS SO CRUCIAL TO HIS CAREER, YET IRONICALLY HE WASN'T DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN IT.
YOU1000000110_S0000143	THE FIRST HALF SAW CHANCES ON BOTH SIDES.
YOU1000000110_S0000144	LITTLE MESSY
YOU1000000110_S0000145	AND EARLY IN THE SECOND, MESSI HAD HIS CHANCE.
YOU1000000110_S0000146	RECEIVED A THROUGH BALL IN ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE POSITIONS.
YOU1000000110_S0000148	HE DIDN'T MISS IT BY MUCH, BUT HE DID MISS IT. AND THAT WILL BE A MOMENT THAT WILL HAUNT MESSI FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
YOU1000000110_S0000150	115 MINUTES GONE AND THESE SIDES STILL COULDN'T BE SEPARATED. IT WAS A STALEMATE UNTIL...
YOU1000000110_S0000153	GERMANY BY THIS STAGE HAD GOT THE GOAL TO GO AHEAD.
YOU1000000110_S0000154	TAKEN WITH TOUCH, WITH FINESSE.
YOU1000000110_S0000155	THE GAME WASN'T OVER.
YOU1000000110_S0000156	THE FINAL MOMENT REALLY OF THE MATCH, THE FINAL SIGNIFICANT MOMENT. BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER FOULED MESSI.
YOU1000000110_S0000157	IT WAS A LONG WAY OUT, HE WAS HERE IN THE WORLD CUP FINAL WITH A CHANCE TO SAVE HIS TEAM.
YOU1000000110_S0000158	THIS IS MESSIETOWN, THIS IS THE MOMENT.
YOU1000000110_S0000160	LIONEL MESSI, NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO, IT'S GONE AWAY, IT'S GONE AWAY.
YOU1000000110_S0000162	THE MOMENT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM.
YOU1000000110_S0000163	AND GERMANY GO ON AND WIN THE GAME AND MESSI'S ON THE LOSING SIDE.
YOU1000000110_S0000164	I THINK THAT MESSI FREE KICK IN 2014 IS A MOMENT WHERE A LOT OF ARGENTINA FANS WILL FEEL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THEIR CHANCE.
YOU1000000110_S0000165	ARGENTINA'S WORLD CUP DREAM, HIS DREAM, HIS DREAM OF HIS LIFETIME WAS OVER.
YOU1000000110_S0000166	NOW GERMANY ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD!
YOU1000000110_S0000167	IT WAS SO DEVASTATING WHEN THEY LOST IN THAT FINAL BECAUSE IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WATCH THE GREATEST PLAYER OF A GENERATION GO ON AND WIN THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000110_S0000169	IT REALLY STARTED TO CHANGE MANY OF PEOPLE'S IDEAS IN ARGENTINA ABOUT MESSI FOR THE NATIONAL TEAM.
YOU1000000110_S0000170	THIS IS YOUR YEAR, ISN'T IT?
YOU1000000110_S0000174	IN 2018 THERE WAS SO MUCH EXPECTATION ON MESSI, CAN HE TAKE THEM TO THE FINAL AND WIN IT THIS TIME?
YOU1000000110_S0000175	2018 FOR ME WAS THE REALISATION THAT MESSI CAN'T DO IT ALONE. MESSI NEEDS MORE QUALITY AROUND HIM.
YOU1000000110_S0000177	THERE WAS ONE OUTSTANDING MOMENT FOR MESSI IN THE TOURNAMENT. HIS GOAL AGAINST NIGEL. HE MADE A RUN OFF THE SHOULDERS OF THE DEFENDER.
YOU1000000110_S0000178	FLIGHTED AND FLOATED AND TAKEN INTO HIS STRIDE BY LIONEL MESSI TO MAKE IT 1 0.
YOU1000000110_S0000179	CONTROL THE BALL ON HIS THIGH THEN TAKE A TOUCH OF HIS LEFT FOOT THEN FINISH WITH HIS RIGHT WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE
YOU1000000110_S0000181	IT'S MESMERIZING. BUT IN THE END IT WASN'T ENOUGH BECAUSE ARGENTINA JUST WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH. THEY NEVER LOOKED LIKE BEING GOOD ENOUGH.
YOU1000000110_S0000182	RIGHT AT THE END OF THE GAME AGAINST FRANCE. THEY FOUGHT BACK, MESSI FLICKED OVER THE BALL FOR AGUERO TO HEAD HOME.
YOU1000000110_S0000183	AND ARGENTINA HAVE ANOTHER ONE! HANG ON A MINUTE, SERGIO AGUERO!
YOU1000000110_S0000184	AND THEY HAD A LAST ATTACK, AND THAT WAS THE FINAL CHARGE.
YOU1000000110_S0000185	ARGENTINA VERY, VERY NEARLY, BUT THE WHISTLE HAS GONE.
YOU1000000110_S0000186	AT THE END OF THE DAY, IN 2018, WE JUST SAW LEO MESSI AND HE'S CUTTING A DESPONDENT FIGURE. AND I THINK IT WAS A MOMENT WHEN YOU REALISE THAT HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE.
YOU1000000110_S0000187	MESSI'S OUT OF THE WORLD CUP AND ARGENTINA ARE OUT. FRANCE HAVE WON IT.
YOU1000000110_S0000188	HE'S WON EVERYTHING. LA LIGA, COPA DEL REY, CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, WORLD CLUB CUP. BUT HE'S NOT WON THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000110_S0000189	HE WANTS TO WIN THE WORLD CUP BECAUSE HE'S A WINNER, BECAUSE HE'S A CHAMPION, BECAUSE HE'S WON EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT NOT TO PROVE ANYTHING.
YOU1000000110_S0000190	AND HE KNOWS THAT THAT WILL DEFINE HIS LEGACY. THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SHOT YOU'D IMAGINE IN 2022, BUT IF IT WAS TO END TODAY...
YOU1000000110_S0000191	YOU WOULD LOOK BACK AND SAY IT'S DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE HE'S ARGUABLY THE BEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME.
YOU1000000110_S0000192	AND THE ONE THING YOU WANT IN THE TROPHY CABINET OF THE BEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME IS A WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000110_S0000193	HE WILL HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE.
YOU1000000110_S0000194	AND CAN THEY DO THAT WITH MISSY, AGE 35?
YOU1000000110_S0000195	WOULD BE JUST AN INCREDIBLE STORY AFTER SO MANY MISSES IN DIFFERENT FASHIONS. IF IT'S THE LAST THING HE DOES IN FOOTBALL, HE WILL WANT TO WIN THE WORLD CUP.
YOU1000000111_S0000001	GAME 7 IS TIED WITH 3 AND A HALF TO GO HERE IN THE FOURTH.
YOU1000000111_S0000003	GREEN BACK TO THOMPSON.
YOU1000000111_S0000005	THOMPSON SPINS, SHOOTS OVER IRVING, CAN'T GET UP THE FALL AND KEVIN LOVE HIS 13TH REBOUND.
YOU1000000111_S0000007	AGAIN, I THINK CLEVELAND WOULD BE BETTER SERVED TO GET INTO WHATEVER THEY'RE GETTING INTO QUICKER.
YOU1000000111_S0000009	NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE J.R. SMITH PROBABLY SET THE SCREEN GETTING CURRY IN THE ACTION.
YOU1000000111_S0000011	CURRY NOW PICKS HIM UP. FIVE TO SHOOT. JAMES POWERS DRIVES DOWN THE LANE. LAYUP MISSED IT. HIGADALA CONTESTED.
YOU1000000111_S0000013	DRAYMOND GREEN KICKS IT OUT. EGGEDALE FOR THREE.
YOU1000000111_S0000015	REBOUND JAMES AND HE'S FOULED BY CURRY.
YOU1000000111_S0000017	THAT'S GOING TO BE FOUR FOULS ON CURRY, THIRD TEAM FOUL.
YOU1000000111_S0000019	AND WE'LL TAKE A TIME OUT AS WE GET UNDER THE THREE MINUTE MARK.
YOU1000000111_S0000021	BUT YOU WANT TO WIN, THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MINDSET. THIS IS GOOD DEFENSE AND GOOD OFFENSE. THAT'S BOTH WAYS. CHAMPIONSHIP EFFORT AND ON THE OTHER END.
YOU1000000111_S0000023	CLEARLY THE CONTACT BY CURRY, FAWCETT, JAMES TO GO DOWN. WE HAVE OURSELVES A BALL GAME, A CHAMPION SOON TO COME.
YOU1000000111_S0000024	TWO FIFTY REMAINING FOURTH QUARTER OF GAME SEVEN.
YOU1000000111_S0000025	THE ONLY TRIPLE DOUBLES IN THE HISTORY OF A GAME SEVEN OF THE FINALS WERE FROM JERRY WEST AND JAMES WORTHY UNTIL TONIGHT AS LEBRON JAMES WITH TWENTY SIX TEN AND ELEVEN.
YOU1000000111_S0000027	GREEN THE SIGN OF POWER MOVE TO THE BASKET. BUT IGUODALA RIGHT THERE. THAT'S CLEARLY CONTACT. IGUODALA GOT AWAY WITH IT.
YOU1000000111_S0000029	AND THOSE ARE THE TOUGH CALLS TO MAKE.
YOU1000000111_S0000031	MEANWHILE DRAYMOND GREEN ONE ASSIST SHY OF A TRIPLE DOUBLE TO JOIN JAMES IRVING WILL BRING IT UP.
YOU1000000111_S0000033	JAMES HOLDING, THROWS IT INTO LOVE, GUARDED BY BARNES. LOVE A LITTLE JUMP, HOOK, SHORT, REBOUND GREEN. 14 REBOUNDS FOR DRAYMOND GREEN TO GO WITH 32 POINTS.
YOU1000000111_S0000035	CURRY FINDS A GOOD DOLLAR DRIVES KICKS IT OUT. BARNES, BARNES OUT TO GREEN PUTS UP A THREE.
YOU1000000111_S0000037	AND CAVS GET IT BACK WITH 2.11 REMAINING.
YOU1000000111_S0000038	THAT'S GREAT ROTATION BY THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS. JAMES CLOSES TO THE OPPOSITE CORNER. LOVE PULLS THE TRIGGER ONTO GREEN.
YOU1000000111_S0000040	TERRIFIC DEFENSE AND VERY GOOD OFFENSE BY THE WARRIORS.
YOU1000000111_S0000041	GOOD OFFENSE ON THE CALVES PART THE LAST POSSESSION WITH LOVE TAKING A TOUGH SHOT, BUT IF I'M KYRIE IRVING ON LEBRON JAMES THE OFFENSE IS RUNNING THROUGH ME RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000111_S0000043	IRVING DRIVES, HOP STEP INSIDE, FLOATS IT UP, MISSES. REBOUND TAKEN BY IGUODALA.
YOU1000000111_S0000044	IGUODALA TO CURRY, BACK TO IGUODALA, UP FOR THE LAYUP! OH, BLOCKED BY JAMES! LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION!
YOU1000000111_S0000046	WOW.
YOU1000000111_S0000048	THIS THIRD BLOCK OF THE GAME AS WE COME UP ON A MINUTE AND A HALF REMAINING.
YOU1000000111_S0000050	BUT AGAIN, GET INTO YOUR STUFF QUICKER.
YOU1000000111_S0000052	FOR A SHOOT.
YOU1000000111_S0000054	JAMES INSIDE, LITTLE JUMP HOOK, THAT'S SHORT. REBOUND TIPPED AND TAKEN BY CURRY.
YOU1000000111_S0000056	CURRY DRIVES ON IRVING, PULLS BACK FOR THREE!
YOU1000000111_S0000058	DOESN'T EVEN HIT THE RIM AS IRVING COMES THE OTHER WAY.
YOU1000000111_S0000060	AND TERON LEW WANTS A TIMEOUT.
YOU1000000111_S0000062	TAKES ONE OF HIS FINAL TWO TIMEOUTS LEFT WITH 109 REMAINING AND A TIE GAME.
YOU1000000111_S0000064	OH MY GOODNESS.
YOU1000000111_S0000066	GREAT PASS BY CURRY, RUNNING HARD BY IGUODALA.
YOU1000000111_S0000068	AND SUPERHUMAN DEFENSIVE RECOVERY BY LEBRON JAMES.
YOU1000000111_S0000070	THERE YOU SEE THE NUMBERS THE TRIPLE DOUBLE FROM LEBRON JAMES AND CURRY MISSING SHOTS WE'VE SEEN IN IT ALL SEASON LONG.
YOU1000000111_S0000072	IN WHAT HAS BEEN AN ELECTRIFYING GAME 7 HERE AT ORACLE ARENA.
YOU1000000111_S0000073	AND MIKE TYLOO ELECTS TO TAKE OUT TRISTAN THOMPSON, INSERT RICHARD JEFFERSON. OFFENSIVELY, THAT'LL GIVE HIM MORE SPACE. BUT IF IT'S NOT A TIMEOUT, DEFENSIVELY,
YOU1000000111_S0000074	THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THE CAVALIERS AGAINST THE LIKES OF CURRY AND THOMPSON.
YOU1000000111_S0000075	EACH TEAM HAS A FOUL TO GIVE AS WE COME UP ON A MINUTE REMAINING. AND THEY'RE PUTTING CURRY IN THE PICK AND ROLL TRYING TO GET HIM ON IRVING.
YOU1000000111_S0000077	IRVING AND KYRIE ONE ON ONE. IRVING PUTS IT UP. IT'S GOOD! KYRIE IRVING FROM DOWNTOWN! AND THE CAVALIERS BY THREE!
YOU1000000111_S0000078	AND I LIKE THE NO TIMEOUT CALL BY STEVE KERR.
YOU1000000111_S0000080	LOVE PICKS UP CURRY. CURRY STEPS BACK, FAKES A THREE, DRIVES AGAIN, SHOT OFF NICELY, FOUND A GREEN, SEVEN TO SHOOT.
YOU1000000111_S0000082	CURRY TAKES THE THREE, STEPS BACK, CROSSOVER, PUTS UP A THREE!
YOU1000000111_S0000084	REBOUND JAMES WITH 30 SECONDS REMAINING.
YOU1000000111_S0000085	WHAT A SPECTACULAR JOB BY LOVE.
YOU1000000111_S0000086	IRVING ON THE DRIVE, GOES INSIDE, LOST IT, GETS IT BACK AND FINDS LOVE. THERE'S A SEVEN SECOND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHOT CLOCK AND GAME CLOCK.
YOU1000000111_S0000087	AND THEY HAD A FOUL TO GIVE SO BARNES FOULS HIM THERE.
YOU1000000111_S0000088	BUT THAT'S A BAD FOUL MIKE, THAT GIVES HIM THREE EXTRA SECONDS AND WHAT WAS KYRIE IRVING DOING IN TRANSITION?
YOU1000000111_S0000090	OH, JAMES WILL INBOUND. NOW THERE'S A 4.7 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHOT CLOCK AND GAME CLOCK.
YOU1000000111_S0000092	CAVALIERS HAVE ONE TIMEOUT LEFT. CAN GO IN THE BACKCOURT IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES TO GET IT.
YOU1000000111_S0000093	BUT THEY'VE GOT TO MANAGE THIS CLOCK. THEY DON'T WANT TO GO EARLY.
YOU1000000111_S0000094	IRVING DRIVES TO JAMES, MISSES THE JAM BUT FOULS.
YOU1000000111_S0000096	WARRIORS HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS REMAINING.
YOU1000000111_S0000098	STAYS A THREE POINT GAME.
YOU1000000111_S0000100	AND MIKE AS A PLAYER THERE'S NO PRESSURE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE UP THREE WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM ONE FREE THROW THAT SHOULD BE THE MINDSET I MISSED IT YOU GOT TO STEP UP AND KNOCK THIS FREE THROW DOWN IF YOU'RE LEBRON JAMES.
YOU1000000111_S0000101	WARRIORS WILL NO DOUBT PULL TIMEOUT. MISS OR MAKE HERE FROM JAMES.
YOU1000000111_S0000103	RATTLES IN THE SECOND FOUR POINT GAME TIMEOUT GOLDEN STATE
YOU1000000111_S0000105	THE BATTERY RUNS OFF.
YOU1000000111_S0000107	EGADALA LOOKING, THOMPSON CATCHES. THOMPSON A COUPLE OF DRIBBLES, HEAD FAKE, TIED UP, THROWS IT IN TO GREEN ON A FOUL ON THE ENTRY PASS. THAT'S THE FOUL TO GIVE.
YOU1000000111_S0000108	NOW THEY'LL TAKE IT OUT OF BOUNDS WITH 6.5 REMAINING.
YOU1000000111_S0000109	AND YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN NOBODY'S AREA TO ALLOW THEM TO KNOCK DOWN A THREE AND YOU GET CONTACT.
YOU1000000111_S0000110	I LOST A PLAYOFF GAME ON A PHANTOM 4 POINT PLAY TO JEFF VAN GUNDY.
YOU1000000111_S0000112	HIGADALA TO INBOUND.
YOU1000000111_S0000113	SHEPARD TRYING TO STAY WITH CURRY, CATCHES ONE DRIBBLE, STEPS BACK, PUTS UP A THREE, WON'T GO, REBOUND TIP TAKEN BY SPADES, FINAL SECONDS.
YOU1000000111_S0000114	IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER. CLEVELAND IS A CITY OF CHAMPIONS ONCE AGAIN. THE CAVALIERS ARE NBA CHAMPIONS.
YOU1000000111_S0000116	CLEVELAND'S LONG SPORTS NIGHTMARE HAS ENDED. THE DROUGHT IS OVER.
YOU1000000111_S0000118	52 YEARS.
YOU1000000111_S0000120	IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE A TITLE.
YOU1000000111_S0000122	AND THE EMOTIONS FOR LEBRON JAMES WHO DELIVERS ON HIS PROMISE TO COME HOME AND BRING A CHAMPIONSHIP TO HIS BELOVED HOMETOWN.
YOU1000000111_S0000124	LET'S GO TO DOORS.
YOU1000000111_S0000125	MIKE OVERCOME WITH EMOTION IS EXACTLY HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE LEBRON'S REACTION AS HE SHARES A HUG WITH KYRIE.
YOU1000000111_S0000127	WE'LL GET IN A MINUTE, BUT HE IS STILL CRYING TEARS OF JOY. LEBRON.
YOU1000000111_S0000128	I'M SORRY, DORIS.
YOU1000000111_S0000129	NO, NO WORRIES, SKYRAE AND LEBRON. AS SOON AS THAT BUZZER SOUNDED, YOUR EMOTIONS LET LOOSE. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW?
YOU1000000111_S0000131	SET OUT A GOAL TWO YEARS WHEN I CAME BACK TO BRING A CHAMPIONSHIP TO THE CITY I
YOU1000000111_S0000133	I GAVE EVERYTHING THAT I HAD. I POURED MY HEART, MY BLOOD, MY SWEAT, MY TEARS FOR THIS GAME.
YOU1000000111_S0000135	AGAINST ALL ODDS, AGAINST ALL ODDS, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WANT TO TAKE THE HARDEST ROAD. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE MAN ABOVE GIVES ME THE HARDEST ROAD, BUT IT'S NOTHING TO MAN ABOVE.
YOU1000000111_S0000136	DON'T PUT YOU IN SITUATIONS THAT YOU CAN'T HANDLE AND I JUST KEPT THAT SAME POSITIVE ATTITUDE LIKE INSTEAD OF SAYING WHY ME? THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS WHAT HE WANT ME TO DO AND CLEVELAND
YOU1000000111_S0000137	THIS IS FOR YOU! OH!
YOU1000000111_S0000138	YOU DID WHAT NO OTHER TEAM HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO, COMING BACK FROM A 3 1 DEFICIT IN THE FINALS. AND TO DO THAT, YOU HAD TO WIN TWICE IN A PLACE THAT PROVED TOO MUCH FOR SO MANY TEAMS.
YOU1000000111_S0000139	WHAT DID YOU FIND IN GAME FIVE HERE?
YOU1000000111_S0000140	JUST LOCKED IN. I HAD TO CHANGE MY APPROACH A LITTLE BIT ON HOW I APPROACH THE GAME. I WASN'T THAT GOOD IN THE FIRST TWO GAMES HERE IN THIS BUILDING. I WATCHED A LOT OF FILM, DETAILED IT OUT.
YOU1000000111_S0000141	CHANGED MY BLUEPRINT AND WAS ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME SPECTACULAR GAMES AFTER BEING DOWN 3 1.
YOU1000000111_S0000143	HISTORY, WE'RE IN THE RECORD BOOKS. WE'RE THE FIRST TEAM EVER TO COME BACK FROM A 3 1 DEFICIT. THIS IS SPECIAL.
YOU1000000112_S0000001	GOT EXPOSED ON THAT PLAY. HERE'S THE THIRD AND SEVENTH. MAHOMES WILL KEEP IT. HE'S GOT AN OPEN FIELD AND EVEN
YOU1000000112_S0000002	EASILY PICKS UP THE FIRST. COMES INTO THE BACKFIELD.
YOU1000000112_S0000003	THIRD AND EIGHT. MAHOMES DOWN THE FIELD. IT'S OPEN. SIX YEARS OLD AND IN KINDERGARTEN.
YOU1000000112_S0000005	FIRST DOWN PLAY'S GONNA BE RUNNING. PLAY WITH JONES. AND RONALD JONES! ANTONIO PRATT IS IN THIS GAME.
YOU1000000112_S0000006	THIRD AND EIGHT. AND THEY GET TO HIM.
YOU1000000112_S0000008	DAVIS IS ON HIM ON SECOND AND FIVE.
YOU1000000112_S0000009	IT'S A RUN PLAY TO EDWARDS. HE LEFT AND THE ROOKIE PICK IN THE DRAFT IN 2019.
YOU1000000112_S0000010	FIRST DOWN.
YOU1000000112_S0000012	MAHOMES AGAIN, THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
YOU1000000112_S0000014	PRESSURE AGAIN, MAHOMES.

YOU1000000114_S0000008	LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, REFEREE HERB DEAN HAS CALLED A STOP TO THIS CONTEST AT 4 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS OF ROUND NUMBER TWO.
YOU1000000114_S0000009	DECLARING THE WINNER BY GKO AND NOW THE NEW INTERIM UFC FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000114_S0000010	THE NOTORIOUS CONOR MCGREGOR!
YOU1000000115_S0000000	HOW THE ECONOMIC MACHINE WORKS IN 30 MINUTES.
YOU1000000115_S0000002	THE ECONOMY WORKS LIKE A SIMPLE MACHINE, BUT MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT OR THEY DON'T AGREE ON HOW IT WORKS.
YOU1000000115_S0000003	AND THIS HAS LED TO A LOT OF NEEDLESS ECONOMIC SUFFERING.
YOU1000000115_S0000005	I FEEL A DEEP SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SHARE MY SIMPLE BUT PRACTICAL ECONOMIC TEMPLATE.
YOU1000000115_S0000007	THOUGH IT'S UNCONVENTIONAL.
YOU1000000115_S0000009	IT HAS HELPED ME TO ANTICIPATE AND TO SIDESTEP THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS. AND IT HAS WORKED WELL FOR ME FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
YOU1000000115_S0000010	LET'S BEGIN. THOUGH THE ECONOMY MIGHT SEEM COMPLEX, IT WORKS IN A SIMPLE, MECHANICAL WAY.
YOU1000000115_S0000011	IT'S MADE UP OF A FEW SIMPLE PARTS AND A LOT OF SIMPLE TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN A ZILLION TIMES.
YOU1000000115_S0000012	THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ABOVE ALL ELSE DRIVEN BY HUMAN NATURE AND THEY CREATE THREE MAIN FORCES THAT DRIVE THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000013	NUMBER ONE, PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH. NUMBER TWO, THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE. AND NUMBER THREE, THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000014	WE'LL LOOK AT THESE THREE FORCES AND HOW LAYING THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER CREATES A GOOD TEMPLATE FOR TRACKING ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS AND FIGURING OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
YOU1000000115_S0000015	LET'S START WITH THE SIMPLEST PART OF THE ECONOMY, TRANSACTIONS.
YOU1000000115_S0000017	AN ECONOMY IS SIMPLY THE SUM OF THE TRANSACTIONS THAT MAKE IT UP, AND A TRANSACTION IS A VERY SIMPLE THING.
YOU1000000115_S0000018	YOU MAKE TRANSACTIONS ALL THE TIME. EVERY TIME YOU BUY SOMETHING, YOU CREATE A TRANSACTION.
YOU1000000115_S0000019	EACH TRANSACTION CONSISTS OF A BUYER EXCHANGING MONEY OR CREDIT WITH A SELLER FOR GOODS, SERVICES OR FINANCIAL ASSETS.
YOU1000000115_S0000020	CREDIT SPENDS JUST LIKE MONEY, SO ADDING TOGETHER THE MONEY SPENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT SPENT, YOU CAN KNOW THE TOTAL SPENDING.
YOU1000000115_S0000021	THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SPENDING DRIVES THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000022	IF YOU DIVIDE THE AMOUNT SPENT BY THE QUANTITY SOLD, YOU GET THE PRICE. AND THAT'S IT. THAT'S A TRANSACTION.
YOU1000000115_S0000023	IT'S THE BUILDING BLOCK OF THE ECONOMIC MACHINE.
YOU1000000115_S0000024	ALL CYCLES AND ALL FORCES IN AN ECONOMY ARE DRIVEN BY TRANSACTIONS. SO, IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND TRANSACTIONS, WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000025	A MARKET CONSISTS OF ALL THE BUYERS AND ALL THE SELLERS MAKING TRANSACTIONS FOR THE SAME THING.
YOU1000000115_S0000026	FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A WHEAT MARKET, A CAR MARKET, A STOCK MARKET, AND MARKETS FOR MILLIONS OF THINGS.
YOU1000000115_S0000027	AN ECONOMY CONSISTS OF ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN ALL OF ITS MARKETS.
YOU1000000115_S0000028	IF YOU ADD UP THE TOTAL SPENDING AND THE TOTAL QUANTITY SOLD IN ALL OF THE MARKETS, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000029	IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000030	PEOPLE, BUSINESSES, BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS ALL ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THE WAY I JUST DESCRIBED.
YOU1000000115_S0000031	EXCHANGING MONEY AND CREDIT FOR GOODS, SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS.
YOU1000000115_S0000032	THE BIGGEST BUYER AND SELLER IS THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO IMPORTANT PARTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000033	A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THAT COLLECTS TAXES AND SPENDS MONEY, AND A CENTRAL BANK, WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BUYERS AND SELLERS,
YOU1000000115_S0000034	BECAUSE IT CONTROLS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000035	IT DOES THIS BY INFLUENCING INTEREST RATES AND PRINTING NEW MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000037	FOR THESE REASONS, AS WE'LL SEE, THE CENTRAL BANK IS AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE FLOW OF CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000038	I WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000039	CREDIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMY AND PROBABLY THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD.
YOU1000000115_S0000040	IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST AND MOST VOLATILE PART.
YOU1000000115_S0000042	JUST LIKE BUYERS AND SELLERS GO TO THE MARKET TO MAKE TRANSACTIONS, SO DO LENDERS AND BORROWERS.
YOU1000000115_S0000043	LENDERS USUALLY WANT TO MAKE THEIR MONEY INTO MORE MONEY, AND BORROWERS USUALLY WANT TO BUY SOMETHING THEY CAN'T AFFORD.
YOU1000000115_S0000044	LIKE A HOUSE OR A CAR, OR THEY WANT TO INVEST IN SOMETHING LIKE STARTING A BUSINESS.
YOU1000000115_S0000045	CREDIT CAN HELP BOTH LENDERS AND BORROWERS GET WHAT THEY WANT.
YOU1000000115_S0000046	BORROWERS PROMISE TO REPAY THE AMOUNT THEY BORROW, CALLED PRINCIPAL, PLUS AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT, CALLED INTEREST.
YOU1000000115_S0000047	WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE HIGH, THERE IS LESS BORROWING BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE.
YOU1000000115_S0000048	WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE LOW, BORROWING INCREASES BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER.
YOU1000000115_S0000050	WHEN BORROWERS PROMISE TO REPAY AND LENDERS BELIEVE THEM, CREDIT IS CREATED.
YOU1000000115_S0000052	ANY TWO PEOPLE CAN AGREE TO CREATE CREDIT OUT OF THIN AIR.
YOU1000000115_S0000053	THAT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH, BUT CREDIT IS TRICKY BECAUSE IT HAS DIFFERENT NAMES.
YOU1000000115_S0000054	AS SOON AS CREDIT IS CREATED, IT IMMEDIATELY TURNS INTO DEBT.
YOU1000000115_S0000055	DEBT IS BOTH AN ASSET TO THE LENDER AND A LIABILITY TO THE BORROWER.
YOU1000000115_S0000057	IN THE FUTURE, WHEN THE BORROWER REPAYS THE LOAN PLUS INTEREST, THE ASSET AND THE LIABILITY DISAPPEAR AND THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED.
YOU1000000115_S0000058	SO WHY IS CREDIT SO IMPORTANT?
YOU1000000115_S0000060	BECAUSE WHEN A BORROWER RECEIVES CREDIT, HE IS ABLE TO INCREASE HIS SPENDING. AND REMEMBER, SPENDING DRIVES THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000061	THIS IS BECAUSE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME.
YOU1000000115_S0000062	THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000115_S0000064	EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND SOMEONE ELSE EARNS, AND EVERY DOLLAR YOU EARN SOMEONE ELSE HAS SPENT.
YOU1000000115_S0000065	SO WHEN YOU SPEND MORE, SOMEONE ELSE EARNS MORE.
YOU1000000115_S0000066	WHEN SOMEONE'S INCOME RISES, IT MAKES LENDERS MORE WILLING TO LEND HIM MONEY BECAUSE NOW HE'S MORE WORTHY OF CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000067	A CREDITWORTHY BORROWER HAS TWO THINGS, THE ABILITY TO REPAY AND COLLATERAL.
YOU1000000115_S0000068	HAVING A LOT OF INCOME IN RELATION TO HIS DEBT GIVES HIM THE ABILITY TO REPAY.
YOU1000000115_S0000070	IN THE EVENT THAT HE CAN'T REPAY, HE HAS VALUABLE ASSETS TO USE AS COLLATERAL THAT CAN BE SOLD. THIS MAKES LENDERS FEEL COMFORTABLE LENDING HIM MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000071	SO INCREASED INCOME ALLOWS INCREASED BORROWING, WHICH ALLOWS INCREASED SPENDING.
YOU1000000115_S0000072	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME, THIS LEADS TO MORE INCREASED BORROWING, AND SO ON.
YOU1000000115_S0000073	THIS SELF REINFORCING PATTERN LEADS TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IS WHY WE HAVE CYCLES.
YOU1000000115_S0000075	IN A TRANSACTION, YOU HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING. AND HOW MUCH YOU GET DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU PRODUCE.
YOU1000000115_S0000077	OVER TIME WE LEARN AND THAT ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE RAISES OUR LIVING STANDARDS. WE CALL THIS PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH.
YOU1000000115_S0000078	THOSE WHO ARE INVENTIVE AND HARD WORKING RAISE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND THEIR LIVING STANDARDS FASTER THAN THOSE WHO ARE COMPLACENT AND LAZY.
YOU1000000115_S0000079	BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE OVER THE SHORT RUN.
YOU1000000115_S0000080	PRODUCTIVITY MATTERS MOST IN THE LONG RUN, BUT CREDIT MATTERS MOST IN THE SHORT RUN.
YOU1000000115_S0000081	THIS IS BECAUSE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH DOESN'T FLUCTUATE MUCH, SO IT'S NOT A BIG DRIVER OF ECONOMIC SWINGS.
YOU1000000115_S0000082	DEBT IS, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO CONSUME MORE THAN WE PRODUCE WHEN WE ACQUIRE IT, AND IT FORCES US TO CONSUME LESS THAN WE PRODUCE WHEN WE HAVE TO PAY IT BACK.
YOU1000000115_S0000083	DEBT SWINGS OCCUR IN TWO BIG CYCLES. ONE TAKES ABOUT 5 TO 8 YEARS AND THE OTHER TAKES ABOUT 75 TO 100 YEARS.
YOU1000000115_S0000084	WHILE MOST PEOPLE FEEL THE SWINGS, THEY TYPICALLY DON'T SEE THEM AS CYCLES BECAUSE THEY SEE THEM TOO UP CLOSE, DAY BY DAY, WEEK BY WEEK.
YOU1000000115_S0000085	IN THIS CHAPTER, WE'RE GOING TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THESE THREE BIG FORCES AND HOW THEY INTERACT TO MAKE UP OUR EXPERIENCES.
YOU1000000115_S0000086	AS MENTIONED, SWINGS AROUND THE LINE ARE NOT DUE TO HOW MUCH INNOVATION OR HARD WORK THERE IS. THEY'RE PRIMARILY DUE TO HOW MUCH CREDIT THERE IS.
YOU1000000115_S0000087	LET'S FOR A SECOND IMAGINE AN ECONOMY WITHOUT CREDIT. IN THIS ECONOMY, THE ONLY WAY I CAN INCREASE MY SPENDING IS TO INCREASE MY INCOME.
YOU1000000115_S0000088	WHICH REQUIRES ME TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND DO MORE WORK. INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IS THE ONLY WAY FOR GROWTH.
YOU1000000115_S0000089	SINCE MY SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME, THE ECONOMY GROWS EVERY TIME I OR ANYONE ELSE IS MORE PRODUCTIVE.
YOU1000000115_S0000090	IF WE FOLLOW THE TRANSACTIONS AND PLAY THIS OUT, WE SEE A PROGRESSION LIKE THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH LINE. BUT BECAUSE WE BORROW, WE HAVE CYCLES.
YOU1000000115_S0000091	THIS ISN'T DUE TO ANY LAWS OR REGULATIONS. IT'S DUE TO HUMAN NATURE AND THE WAY THAT CREDIT WORKS.
YOU1000000115_S0000092	THINK OF BORROWING AS SIMPLY A WAY OF PULLING SPENDING FORWARD. IN ORDER TO BUY SOMETHING YOU CAN'T AFFORD, YOU NEED TO SPEND MORE THAN YOU MAKE.
YOU1000000115_S0000093	TO DO THIS, YOU ESSENTIALLY NEED TO BORROW FROM YOUR FUTURE SELF. IN DOING SO, YOU CREATE A TIME IN THE FUTURE THAT YOU NEED TO SPEND LESS THAN YOU MAKE.
YOU1000000115_S0000094	IN ORDER TO PAY IT BACK. IT VERY QUICKLY RESEMBLES A CYCLE. BASICALLY, ANY TIME YOU BORROW, YOU CREATE A CYCLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000095	THIS IS AS TRUE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AS IT IS FOR THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000096	THIS IS WHY UNDERSTANDING CREDIT IS SO IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT SETS INTO MOTION A MECHANICAL, PREDICTABLE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.
YOU1000000115_S0000097	THIS MAKES CREDIT DIFFERENT FROM MONEY. MONEY IS WHAT YOU SETTLE TRANSACTIONS WITH.
YOU1000000115_S0000098	WHEN YOU BUY A BEER FROM A BARTENDER WITH CASH, THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED IMMEDIATELY.
YOU1000000115_S0000099	BUT WHEN YOU BUY A BEER WITH CREDIT, IT'S LIKE STARTING A BAR TAB. YOU'RE SAYING YOU PROMISE TO PAY IN THE FUTURE.
YOU1000000115_S0000100	TOGETHER, YOU AND THE BARTENDER CREATE AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY. YOU JUST CREATED CREDIT OUT OF THIN AIR.
YOU1000000115_S0000101	IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU PAY THE BAR TAB LATER THAT THE ASSET AND THE LIABILITY DISAPPEAR, THE DEBT GOES AWAY, AND THE TRANSACTION IS SETTLED.
YOU1000000115_S0000103	THE REALITY IS THAT MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE CALL MONEY IS ACTUALLY CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000104	THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES IS ABOUT $50 TRILLION, AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS ONLY ABOUT $3 TRILLION.
YOU1000000115_S0000105	REMEMBER, IN AN ECONOMY WITHOUT CREDIT, THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE YOUR SPENDING IS TO PRODUCE MORE.
YOU1000000115_S0000106	BUT IN AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT, YOU CAN ALSO INCREASE YOUR SPENDING BY BORROWING.
YOU1000000115_S0000107	AS A RESULT, AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT HAS MORE SPENDING AND ALLOWS INCOMES TO RISE FASTER THAN PRODUCTIVITY OVER THE SHORT RUN, BUT NOT OVER THE LONG RUN.
YOU1000000115_S0000108	NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG, CREDIT ISN'T NECESSARILY SOMETHING BAD THAT JUST CAUSES CYCLES.
YOU1000000115_S0000109	IT'S BAD WHEN IT FINANCES OVERCONSUMPTION THAT CAN'T BE PAID BACK.
YOU1000000115_S0000110	HOWEVER, IT'S GOOD WHEN IT EFFICIENTLY ALLOCATES RESOURCES AND PRODUCES INCOME SO YOU CAN PAY BACK THE DEBT.
YOU1000000115_S0000111	FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU BORROW MONEY TO BUY A BIG TV, IT DOESN'T GENERATE INCOME FOR YOU TO PAY BACK THE DEBT.
YOU1000000115_S0000112	BUT IF YOU BORROW MONEY TO, SAY, BUY A TRACTOR...
YOU1000000115_S0000114	AND THAT TRACTOR LETS YOU HARVEST MORE CROPS AND EARN MORE MONEY, THEN YOU CAN PAY BACK YOUR DEBT AND IMPROVE YOUR LIVING STANDARDS.
YOU1000000115_S0000116	IN AN ECONOMY WITH CREDIT, WE CAN FOLLOW THE TRANSACTIONS AND SEE HOW CREDIT CREATES GROWTH.
YOU1000000115_S0000118	LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. SUPPOSE YOU EARN $100,000 A YEAR AND HAVE NO DEBT. YOU ARE CREDIT WORTHY ENOUGH TO BORROW $10,000.
YOU1000000115_S0000119	SAY ON A CREDIT CARD, SO YOU CAN SPEND $110,000 EVEN THOUGH YOU ONLY EARN $100,000.
YOU1000000115_S0000120	SINCE YOUR SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME, SOMEONE IS EARNING $110,000.
YOU1000000115_S0000121	THE PERSON EARNING $110,000 WITH NO DEBT CAN BORROW $11,000 SO HE CAN SPEND $121,000
YOU1000000115_S0000122	EVEN THOUGH HE HAS ONLY EARNED $110,000.
YOU1000000115_S0000123	HIS SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME AND BY FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTIONS WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS IN A SELF REINFORCING PATTERN.
YOU1000000115_S0000124	BUT REMEMBER, BORROWING CREATES CYCLES AND IF THE CYCLE GOES UP, IT EVENTUALLY NEEDS TO COME DOWN.
YOU1000000115_S0000125	THIS LEADS US INTO THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000127	AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY INCREASES, WE SEE AN EXPANSION, THE FIRST PHASE OF THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000128	SPENDING CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND PRICES START TO RISE.
YOU1000000115_S0000129	THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN SPENDING IS FUELED BY CREDIT, WHICH CAN BE CREATED INSTANTLY OUT OF THIN AIR.
YOU1000000115_S0000130	WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING AND INCOMES GROW FASTER THAN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS, PRICES RISE.
YOU1000000115_S0000131	WHEN PRICES RISE, WE CALL THIS INFLATION. THE CENTRAL BANK DOESN'T WANT TOO MUCH INFLATION BECAUSE IT CAUSES PROBLEMS.
YOU1000000115_S0000132	SEEING PRICES RISE, IT RAISES INTEREST RATES. WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES, FEWER PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BORROW MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000133	AND THE COST OF EXISTING DEBTS RISES. THINK ABOUT THIS AS THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON YOUR CREDIT CARD GOING UP.
YOU1000000115_S0000135	BECAUSE PEOPLE BORROW LESS AND HAVE HIGHER DEBT REPAYMENTS, THEY HAVE LESS MONEY LEFT OVER TO SPEND. SO SPENDING SLOWS.
YOU1000000115_S0000136	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME, INCOMES DROP, AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.
YOU1000000115_S0000137	WHEN PEOPLE SPEND LESS, PRICES GO DOWN. WE CALL THIS DEFLATION. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DECREASES.
YOU1000000115_S0000138	AND WE HAVE A RECESSION. IF THE RECESSION BECOMES TOO SEVERE AND INFLATION IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM,
YOU1000000115_S0000139	THE CENTRAL BANK WILL LOWER INTEREST RATES TO CAUSE EVERYTHING TO PICK UP AGAIN.
YOU1000000115_S0000140	WITH LOW INTEREST RATES, DEBT REPAYMENTS ARE REDUCED AND BORROWING AND SPENDING PICK UP, AND WE SEE ANOTHER EXPANSION.
YOU1000000115_S0000141	AS YOU CAN SEE, THE ECONOMY WORKS LIKE A MACHINE.
YOU1000000115_S0000142	IN THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE, SPENDING IS CONSTRAINED ONLY BY THE WILLINGNESS OF LENDERS AND BORROWERS TO PROVIDE AND RECEIVE CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000143	WHEN CREDIT IS EASILY AVAILABLE, THERE'S AN ECONOMIC EXPANSION. WHEN CREDIT ISN'T EASILY AVAILABLE, THERE'S A RECESSION.
YOU1000000115_S0000144	AND NOTE THAT THIS CYCLE IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY BY THE CENTRAL BANK.
YOU1000000115_S0000145	THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE TYPICALLY LASTS FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AND HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR DECADES.
YOU1000000115_S0000146	BUT NOTICE THAT THE BOTTOM AND TOP OF EACH CYCLE FINISH WITH MORE GROWTH THAN THE PREVIOUS CYCLE AND WITH MORE DEBT.
YOU1000000115_S0000147	WHY? BECAUSE PEOPLE PUSH IT.
YOU1000000115_S0000148	THEY HAVE AN INCLINATION TO BORROW AND SPEND MORE INSTEAD OF PAYING BACK DEBT. IT'S HUMAN NATURE.
YOU1000000115_S0000149	BECAUSE OF THIS, OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME, DEBTS RISE FASTER THAN INCOMES, CREATING THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000151	DESPITE PEOPLE BECOMING MORE INDEBTED, LENDERS EVEN MORE FREELY EXTEND CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000153	WHY?
YOU1000000115_S0000155	BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS THINGS ARE GOING GREAT. PEOPLE ARE JUST FOCUSED ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LATELY. AND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LATELY?
YOU1000000115_S0000157	INCOMES HAVE BEEN RISING. ASSET VALUES ARE GOING UP. THE STOCK MARKET ROARS. IT'S A BOOM.
YOU1000000115_S0000158	IT PAYS TO BUY GOODS, SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH BORROWED MONEY. WHEN PEOPLE DO A LOT OF THAT, WE CALL IT A BUBBLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000159	SO EVEN THOUGH DEBTS HAVE BEEN GROWING, INCOMES HAVE BEEN GROWING NEARLY AS FAST TO OFFSET THEM. LET'S CALL THE RATIO OF DEBT TO INCOME THE DEBT BURDEN.
YOU1000000115_S0000160	SO LONG AS INCOMES CONTINUE TO RISE, THE DEBT BURDEN STAYS MANAGEABLE. AT THE SAME TIME, ASSET VALUES SOAR.
YOU1000000115_S0000161	PEOPLE BORROW HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO BUY ASSETS AS INVESTMENTS, CAUSING THEIR PRICES TO RISE EVEN HIGHER.
YOU1000000115_S0000162	PEOPLE FEEL WEALTHY.
YOU1000000115_S0000164	SO EVEN WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF LOTS OF DEBT, RISING INCOMES AND ASSET VALUES HELP BORROWERS REMAIN CREDITWORTHY FOR A LONG TIME.
YOU1000000115_S0000165	BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY CANNOT CONTINUE FOREVER. AND IT DOESN'T.
YOU1000000115_S0000166	OVER DECADES, DEBT BURDENS SLOWLY INCREASED, CREATING LARGER AND LARGER DEBT REPAYMENTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000167	AT SOME POINT, DEBT REPAYMENTS START GROWING FASTER THAN INCOMES, FORCING PEOPLE TO CUT BACK ON THEIR SPENDING.
YOU1000000115_S0000168	AND SINCE ONE PERSON'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCOME, INCOMES BEGIN TO GO DOWN, WHICH MAKES PEOPLE LESS CREDITWORTHY.
YOU1000000115_S0000170	CAUSING BORROWING TO GO DOWN. DEBT REPAYMENTS CONTINUE TO RISE, WHICH MAKES SPENDING DROP EVEN FURTHER.
YOU1000000115_S0000171	AND THE CYCLE REVERSES ITSELF.
YOU1000000115_S0000173	THIS IS THE LONG TERM DEBT PEAK. DEBT BURDENS HAVE SIMPLY BECOME TOO BIG.
YOU1000000115_S0000175	FOR THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD, THIS HAPPENED IN 2008.
YOU1000000115_S0000176	IT HAPPENED FOR THE SAME REASON IT HAPPENED IN JAPAN IN 1989 AND IN THE UNITED STATES BACK IN 1929.
YOU1000000115_S0000177	NOW THE ECONOMY BEGINS DELEVERAGING.
YOU1000000115_S0000179	IN A DELEVERAGING, PEOPLE CUT SPENDING, INCOMES FALL, CREDIT DISAPPEARS, ASSET PRICES DROP.
YOU1000000115_S0000180	BANKS GET SQUEEZED, THE STOCK MARKET CRASHES, SOCIAL TENSIONS RISE AND THE WHOLE THING STARTS TO FEED ON ITSELF THE OTHER WAY.
YOU1000000115_S0000182	AS INCOMES FALL AND DEBT REPAYMENTS RISE, BORROWERS GET SQUEEZED, NO LONGER CREDIT WORTHY.
YOU1000000115_S0000183	CREDIT DRIES UP, AND BORROWERS CAN NO LONGER BORROW ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE THEIR DEBT REPAYMENTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000184	SCRAMBLING TO FILL THIS HOLE, BORROWERS ARE FORCED TO SELL ASSETS. THE RUSH TO SELL ASSETS FLOODS THE MARKET AT THE SAME TIME AS SPENDING FALLS.
YOU1000000115_S0000185	THIS IS WHEN THE STOCK MARKET COLLAPSES, THE REAL ESTATE MARKET TANKS AND BANKS GET INTO TROUBLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000186	AS ASSET PRICES DROP, THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL BORROWERS CAN PUT UP DROPS. THIS MAKES BORROWERS EVEN LESS CREDIT WORTHY.
YOU1000000115_S0000187	PEOPLE FEEL POOR. CREDIT RAPIDLY DISAPPEARS.
YOU1000000115_S0000188	LESS SPENDING, LESS INCOME, LESS WEALTH, LESS CREDIT, LESS BORROWING, AND SO ON. IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000189	THIS APPEARS SIMILAR TO A RECESSION, BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT INTEREST RATES CAN'T BE LOWERED TO SAVE THE DAY.
YOU1000000115_S0000190	IN A RECESSION, LOWERING INTEREST RATES WORKS TO STIMULATE BORROWING.
YOU1000000115_S0000191	HOWEVER, IN A DELEVERAGING, LOWERING INTEREST RATES DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE ALREADY LOW AND SOON HIT 0%. SO THE STIMULATION ENDS.
YOU1000000115_S0000193	INTEREST RATES IN THE UNITED STATES HIT 0% DURING THE DELEVERAGING OF THE 1930S AND AGAIN IN 2008.
YOU1000000115_S0000194	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RECESSION AND A DELEVERAGING.
YOU1000000115_S0000195	IS THAT IN A DELEVERAGING, BORROWER'S DEBT BURDENS HAVE SIMPLY GOTTEN TOO BIG AND CAN'T BE RELIEVED BY LOWERING INTEREST RATES.
YOU1000000115_S0000196	LENDERS REALIZE THAT DEBTS HAVE BECOME TOO LARGE TO EVER BE FULLY PAID BACK.
YOU1000000115_S0000197	BORROWERS HAVE LOST THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY AND THEIR COLLATERAL HAS LOST VALUE.
YOU1000000115_S0000198	THEY FEEL CRIPPLED BY THE DEBT. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT MORE. LENDERS STOP LENDING. BORROWERS STOP BORROWING.
YOU1000000115_S0000199	THINK OF THE ECONOMY AS BEING NOT CREDITWORTHY, JUST LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL. SO WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT A DELEVERAGING?
YOU1000000115_S0000200	THE PROBLEM IS DEBT BURDENS ARE TOO HIGH AND THEY MUST COME DOWN.
YOU1000000115_S0000201	THERE ARE FOUR WAYS THIS CAN HAPPEN. ONE, PEOPLE, BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS CUT THEIR SPENDING.
YOU1000000115_S0000202	2. DEBTS ARE REDUCED THROUGH DEFAULTS AND RESTRUCTURINGS. 3. WEALTH IS REDISTRIBUTED FROM THE HAVES TO THE HAVE NOTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000203	AND FINALLY, FOUR, THE CENTRAL BANK PRINTS NEW MONEY. THESE FOUR WAYS HAVE HAPPENED IN EVERY DELEVERAGING IN MODERN HISTORY.
YOU1000000115_S0000205	USUALLY, SPENDING IS CUT FIRST. AS WE JUST SAW, PEOPLE, BUSINESSES, AND EVEN GOVERNMENTS TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS AND CUT THEIR SPENDING SO THAT THEY CAN PAY DOWN THEIR DEBT.
YOU1000000115_S0000206	THIS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS AUSTERITY. WHEN BORROWERS STOP TAKING ON NEW DEBTS AND START PAYING DOWN OLD DEBTS,
YOU1000000115_S0000207	YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE DEATH BURDEN TO DECREASE, BUT THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS BECAUSE SPENDING IS CUT.
YOU1000000115_S0000208	AND ONE MAN'S SPENDING IS ANOTHER MAN'S INCOME, IT CAUSES INCOMES TO FALL.
YOU1000000115_S0000209	THEY FALL FASTER THAN DEBTS ARE REPAID AND THE DEBT BURDEN ACTUALLY GETS WORSE. AS WE'VE SEEN, THIS CUT IN SPENDING IS DEFLATIONARY AND PAINFUL.
YOU1000000115_S0000210	BUSINESSES ARE FORCED TO CUT COSTS, WHICH MEANS LESS JOBS AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT. THIS LEADS TO THE NEXT STEP. DEBTS MUST BE REDUCED.
YOU1000000115_S0000211	MANY BORROWERS FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPAY THEIR LOANS, AND A BORROWER'S DEBTS ARE A LENDER'S ASSETS.
YOU1000000115_S0000212	WHEN A BORROWER DOESN'T REPAY THE BANK, PEOPLE GET NERVOUS THAT THE BANK WON'T BE ABLE TO REPAY THEM, SO THEY RUSH TO WITHDRAW THEIR MONEY FROM THE BANK.
YOU1000000115_S0000213	BANKS GET SQUEEZED AND PEOPLE, BUSINESSES AND BANKS DEFAULT ON THEIR DEBTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000214	THIS SEVERE ECONOMIC CONTRACTION IS A DEPRESSION.
YOU1000000115_S0000215	A BIG PART OF A DEPRESSION IS PEOPLE DISCOVERING MUCH OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THEIR WEALTH ISN'T REALLY THERE.
YOU1000000115_S0000216	LET'S GO BACK TO THE BAR. WHEN YOU BOUGHT A BEER AND PUT IT ON A BAR TAB, YOU PROMISED TO REPAY THE BARTENDER.
YOU1000000115_S0000217	YOUR PROMISE BECAME AN ASSET OF THE BARTENDER.
YOU1000000115_S0000218	BUT IF YOU BREAK YOUR PROMISE, IF YOU DON'T PAY HIM BACK AND ESSENTIALLY DEFAULT ON YOUR BAR TAB, THEN THE ASSET HE HAS ISN'T REALLY WORTH ANYTHING.
YOU1000000115_S0000219	IT HAS BASICALLY DISAPPEARED.
YOU1000000115_S0000221	MANY LENDERS DON'T WANT THEIR ASSETS TO DISAPPEAR AND AGREE TO DEBT RESTRUCTURING.
YOU1000000115_S0000222	DEBT RESTRUCTURING MEANS LENDERS GET PAID BACK LESS, OR GET PAID BACK OVER A LONGER TIME FRAME, OR AT A LOWER INTEREST RATE THAN WAS FIRST AGREED.
YOU1000000115_S0000223	SOMEHOW, A CONTRACT IS BROKEN IN A WAY THAT REDUCES DEBT. LENDERS WOULD RATHER HAVE A LITTLE OF SOMETHING THAN ALL OF NOTHING.
YOU1000000115_S0000224	EVEN THOUGH DEBT DISAPPEARS, DEBT RESTRUCTURING CAUSES INCOME AND ASSET VALUES TO DISAPPEAR FASTER, SO THE DEBT BURDEN CONTINUES TO GET WORSE.
YOU1000000115_S0000225	LIKE CUTTING SPENDING, DEBT REDUCTION IS ALSO PAINFUL AND DEFLATIONARY.
YOU1000000115_S0000227	ALL OF THIS IMPACTS THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE LOWER INCOMES AND LESS EMPLOYMENT MEANS THE GOVERNMENT COLLECTS FEWER TAXES.
YOU1000000115_S0000228	AT THE SAME TIME, IT NEEDS TO INCREASE ITS SPENDING BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN.
YOU1000000115_S0000229	MANY OF THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE INADEQUATE SAVINGS AND NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
YOU1000000115_S0000230	ADDITIONALLY, GOVERNMENTS CREATE STIMULUS PLANS AND INCREASE THEIR SPENDING TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECREASE IN THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000115_S0000231	GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET DEFICITS EXPLODE IN A DELEVERAGING BECAUSE THEY SPEND MORE THAN THEY EARN IN TAXES.
YOU1000000115_S0000232	THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE BUDGET DEFICIT ON THE NEWS.
YOU1000000115_S0000234	TO FUND THEIR DEFICITS, GOVERNMENTS NEED TO EITHER RAISE TAXES OR BORROW MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000235	BUT WITH INCOMES FALLING AND SO MANY UNEMPLOYED, WHO IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM?
YOU1000000115_S0000236	THE RICH. SINCE GOVERNMENTS NEED MORE MONEY AND SINCE WEALTH IS HEAVILY CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE,
YOU1000000115_S0000237	GOVERNMENTS NATURALLY RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, WHICH FACILITATES A REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN THE ECONOMY FROM THE HAVES TO THE HAVE NOTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000238	THE HAVE NOTS WHO ARE SUFFERING BEGIN TO RESENT THE WEALTHY HAVES.
YOU1000000115_S0000239	THE WEALTHY HAVES BEING SQUEEZED BY THE WEAK ECONOMY, FALLING ASSET PRICES AND HIGHER TAXES BEGIN TO RESENT THE HAVE NOTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000240	IF THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES, SOCIAL DISORDER CAN BREAK OUT.
YOU1000000115_S0000241	NOT ONLY DO TENSIONS RISE WITHIN COUNTRIES, THEY CAN RISE BETWEEN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY DEBTOR AND CREDITOR COUNTRIES.
YOU1000000115_S0000242	THIS SITUATION CAN LEAD TO POLITICAL CHANGE THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE EXTREME.
YOU1000000115_S0000243	IN THE 1930S, THIS LED TO HITLER COMING TO POWER, WAR IN EUROPE, AND DEPRESSION IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000115_S0000244	PRESSURE TO DO SOMETHING TO END THE DEPRESSION INCREASES.
YOU1000000115_S0000245	REMEMBER, MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS MONEY WAS ACTUALLY CREDIT. SO WHEN CREDIT DISAPPEARS, PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000246	PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE FOR MONEY AND YOU REMEMBER WHO CAN PRINT MONEY? THE CENTRAL BANK CAN.
YOU1000000115_S0000248	HAVING ALREADY LOWERED ITS INTEREST RATES TO NEARLY ZERO, IT'S FORCED TO PRINT MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000249	UNLIKE CUTTING SPENDING, DEBT REDUCTION, AND WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION, PRINTING MONEY IS INFLATIONARY AND STIMULATIVE.
YOU1000000115_S0000250	INEVITABLY, THE CENTRAL BANK PRINTS NEW MONEY OUT OF THIN AIR AND USES IT TO BUY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND GOVERNMENT BONDS.
YOU1000000115_S0000251	IT HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
YOU1000000115_S0000252	AND AGAIN IN 2008 WHEN THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL BANK, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, PRINTED OVER $2 TRILLION.
YOU1000000115_S0000253	OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD THAT COULD, PRINTED A LOT OF MONEY TOO.
YOU1000000115_S0000254	BY BUYING FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH THIS MONEY, IT HELPS DRIVE UP ASSET PRICES, WHICH MAKES PEOPLE MORE CREDITWORTHY.
YOU1000000115_S0000255	HOWEVER, THIS ONLY HELPS THOSE WHO OWN FINANCIAL ASSETS. YOU SEE, THE CENTRAL BANK CAN PRINT MONEY, BUT IT CAN ONLY BUY FINANCIAL ASSETS.
YOU1000000115_S0000256	THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, ON THE OTHER HAND, CAN BUY GOODS AND SERVICES AND PUT MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE, BUT IT CAN'T PRINT MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000257	SO IN ORDER TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY, THE TWO MUST COOPERATE.
YOU1000000115_S0000258	BY BUYING GOVERNMENT BONDS, THE CENTRAL BANK ESSENTIALLY LENDS MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT, ALLOWING IT TO RUN A DEFICIT AND INCREASE SPENDING.
YOU1000000115_S0000259	ON GOODS AND SERVICES THROUGH ITS STIMULUS PROGRAMS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
YOU1000000115_S0000260	THIS INCREASES PEOPLE'S INCOME AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT'S DEBT. HOWEVER, IT WILL LOWER THE ECONOMY'S TOTAL DEBT BURDEN.
YOU1000000115_S0000261	THIS IS A VERY RISKY TIME. POLICYMAKERS NEED TO BALANCE THE FOUR WAYS THAT DEBT BURDENS COME DOWN.
YOU1000000115_S0000263	THE DEFLATIONARY WAYS NEED TO BALANCE WITH THE INFLATIONARY WAYS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN STABILITY.
YOU1000000115_S0000264	IF BALANCED CORRECTLY, THERE CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGE.
YOU1000000115_S0000266	YOU SEE, A DELEVERAGING CAN BE UGLY OR IT CAN BE BEAUTIFUL. HOW CAN A DELEVERAGING BE BEAUTIFUL?
YOU1000000115_S0000268	EVEN THOUGH A DELEVERAGING IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION, HANDLING A DIFFICULT SITUATION IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY IS BEAUTIFUL.
YOU1000000115_S0000269	A LOT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE DEBT FUELED, UNBALANCED EXCESSES OF THE LEVERAGING PHASE.
YOU1000000115_S0000270	IN A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING, DEBTS DECLINE RELATIVE TO INCOME, REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH IS POSITIVE, AND INFLATION ISN'T A PROBLEM.
YOU1000000115_S0000271	IT IS ACHIEVED BY HAVING THE RIGHT BALANCE. THE RIGHT BALANCE REQUIRES A CERTAIN MIX OF CUTTING SPENDING, REDUCING DEBT,
YOU1000000115_S0000273	TRANSFERRING WEALTH AND PRINTING MONEY SO THAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY CAN BE MAINTAINED.
YOU1000000115_S0000274	PEOPLE ASK IF PRINTING MONEY WILL RAISE INFLATION. IT WON'T IF IT OFFSETS FALLING CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000275	REMEMBER, SPENDING IS WHAT MATTERS. A DOLLAR OF SPENDING PAID FOR WITH MONEY HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON PRICE AS A DOLLAR OF SPENDING PAID FOR WITH CREDIT.
YOU1000000115_S0000277	BY PRINTING MONEY, THE CENTRAL BANK CAN MAKE UP FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CREDIT WITH AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY.
YOU1000000115_S0000278	IN ORDER TO TURN THINGS AROUND, THE CENTRAL BANK NEEDS TO NOT ONLY PUMP UP INCOME GROWTH,
YOU1000000115_S0000279	BUT GET THE RATE OF INCOME GROWTH HIGHER THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST ON THE ACCUMULATED DEBT.
YOU1000000115_S0000280	SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT? BASICALLY, INCOME NEEDS TO GROW FASTER THAN DEBT GROWS.
YOU1000000115_S0000281	FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S ASSUME THAT A COUNTRY GOING THROUGH A DELEVERAGING HAS A DEBT TO INCOME RATIO OF 100%.
YOU1000000115_S0000282	THAT MEANS THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEBT IT HAS IS THE SAME AS THE AMOUNT OF INCOME THE ENTIRE COUNTRY MAKES IN A YEAR.
YOU1000000115_S0000283	NOW THINK ABOUT THE INTEREST RATE ON THAT DEBT. LET'S SAY IT'S 2%.
YOU1000000115_S0000284	IF DEBT IS GROWING AT 2% BECAUSE OF THAT INTEREST RATE AND INCOME IS ONLY GROWING AT AROUND 1%, YOU WILL NEVER REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN.
YOU1000000115_S0000285	YOU NEED TO PRINT ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THE RATE OF INCOME GROWTH ABOVE THE RATE OF INTEREST.
YOU1000000115_S0000286	HOWEVER, PRINTING MONEY COULD EASILY BE ABUSED BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO DO AND PEOPLE PREFER IT TO THE ALTERNATIVES.
YOU1000000115_S0000287	THE KEY IS TO AVOID PRINTING TOO MUCH MONEY AND CAUSING UNACCEPTABLY HIGH INFLATION, THE WAY GERMANY DID DURING ITS DELEVERAGING IN THE 1920S.
YOU1000000115_S0000288	IF POLICY MAKERS ACHIEVE THE RIGHT BALANCE, A DELEVERAGING ISN'T SO DRAMATIC. GROWTH IS SLOW, BUT DEBT BURDENS GO DOWN.
YOU1000000115_S0000289	THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING. WHEN INCOMES BEGIN TO RISE, BORROWERS BEGIN TO APPEAR MORE CREDITWORTHY.
YOU1000000115_S0000290	AND WHEN BORROWERS APPEAR MORE CREDITWORTHY, LENDERS BEGIN TO LEND MONEY AGAIN. DEBT BURDENS FINALLY BEGIN TO FALL.
YOU1000000115_S0000291	ABLE TO BORROW MONEY, PEOPLE CAN SPEND MORE. EVENTUALLY, THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO GROW AGAIN, LEADING TO THE REFLATION PHASE OF THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE.
YOU1000000115_S0000292	THOUGH THE DELEVERAGING PROCESS CAN BE HORRIBLE IF HANDLED BADLY, IF HANDLED WELL, IT WILL EVENTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM.
YOU1000000115_S0000293	IT TAKES ROUGHLY A DECADE OR MORE FOR DEBT BURDENS TO FALL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TO GET BACK TO NORMAL. HENCE THE TERM, LOST DECADE.
YOU1000000115_S0000294	IN CLOSING, OF COURSE THE ECONOMY IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS TEMPLATE SUGGESTS.
YOU1000000115_S0000295	HOWEVER, LAYING THE SHORT TERM DEBT CYCLE ON TOP OF THE LONG TERM DEBT CYCLE, AND THEN LAYING BOTH OF THEM ON TOP OF THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH LINE,
YOU1000000115_S0000296	GIVES A REASONABLY GOOD TEMPLATE FOR SEEING WHERE WE'VE BEEN, WHERE WE ARE NOW, AND WHERE WE'RE PROBABLY HEADED.
YOU1000000115_S0000297	SO, IN SUMMARY, THERE ARE THREE RULES OF THUMB THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS.
YOU1000000115_S0000298	FIRST, DON'T HAVE DEBT RISE FASTER THAN INCOME, BECAUSE YOUR DEBT BURDENS WILL EVENTUALLY CRUSH YOU.
YOU1000000115_S0000299	SECOND, DON'T HAVE INCOME RISE FASTER THAN PRODUCTIVITY, BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE.
YOU1000000115_S0000300	AND THIRD, DO ALL THAT YOU CAN TO RAISE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY, BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN, THAT'S WHAT MATTERS MOST.
YOU1000000115_S0000301	THIS IS SIMPLE ADVICE FOR YOU AND IT'S SIMPLE ADVICE FOR POLICYMAKERS.
YOU1000000115_S0000302	YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED, BUT MOST PEOPLE, INCLUDING MOST POLICY MAKERS, DON'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THIS.
YOU1000000115_S0000303	THIS TEMPLATE HAS WORKED FOR ME AND I HOPE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU. THANK YOU.
YOU1000000116_S0000000	AS WE BEGIN OUR JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD OF ECONOMICS, I THOUGHT I WOULD BEGIN WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ECONOMISTS OF ALL TIMES,
YOU1000000116_S0000001	THE SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHER ADAM SMITH. AND HE REALLY IS KIND OF THE FIRST REAL ECONOMIST IN THE WAY THAT WE VIEW IT NOW. AND THIS IS FROM HIS
YOU1000000116_S0000002	THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, PUBLISHED IN 1776, COINCIDENTALLY THE SAME YEAR AS THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
YOU1000000116_S0000003	AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS EXCERPTS. HE GENERALLY, INDEED, HE BEING AN ECONOMIC ACTOR, NEITHER INTENDS TO PROMOTE THE PUBLIC INTEREST NOR KNOWS HOW MUCH HE IS PROMOTING IT.
YOU1000000116_S0000004	BY DIRECTING THAT INDUSTRY, SO THE INDUSTRY IN CONTROL OF THAT INDIVIDUAL ACTOR, IN SUCH A MANNER AS ITS PRODUCE MAY BE OF THE GREATEST VALUE, HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN GAIN.
YOU1000000116_S0000005	HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN GAIN, AND HE IS IN THIS, AS IN MANY OTHER CASES, LED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND TO PROMOTE AND END
YOU1000000116_S0000006	WHICH WAS NO PART OF HIS INTENTION. AND THIS TERM, INVISIBLE HAND, IS FAMOUS. LED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND TO PROMOTE AN END
YOU1000000116_S0000007	WHICH WAS NO PART OF HIS INTENTION. HE'S SAYING, LOOK, WHEN INDIVIDUAL ACTORS JUST ACT IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST, THAT OFTEN AN AGGREGATE LEADS TO THINGS THAT EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS DID NOT INTEND.
YOU1000000116_S0000008	AND THEN HE SAYS, NOR IS IT ALWAYS THE WORST FOR SOCIETY THAT IT WAS NO PART OF IT. SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY A BAD THING. BY PURSUING HIS OWN INTEREST.
YOU1000000116_S0000009	HE FREQUENTLY PROMOTES THAT OF THE SOCIETY MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN WHEN HE REALLY INTENDS TO PROMOTE IT. SO THIS IS A PRETTY STRONG STATEMENT.
YOU1000000116_S0000010	IT'S REALLY AT THE CORE OF CAPITALISM. AND THAT'S WHY I POINT OUT THAT IT WAS PUBLISHED THE SAME YEAR AS THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
YOU1000000116_S0000011	AMERICA, THE FOUNDING FATHERS, THEY WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE CONSTITUTION. IT REALLY TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY, WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS.
YOU1000000116_S0000012	BUT THE UNITED STATES, IN ITS OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF AN AMERICAN, IS AT LEAST AS INFLUENCED BY THE WORK OF ADAM SMITH.
YOU1000000116_S0000013	BY THESE KIND OF FOUNDATIONAL IDEAS OF CAPITALISM. AND THEY JUST BOTH HAPPENED TO HAPPEN AROUND THE SAME TIME.
YOU1000000116_S0000014	BUT THIS IDEA IS NOT ALWAYS THAT INTUITIVE. INDIVIDUAL ACTORS, BY ESSENTIALLY PURSUING THEIR OWN SELF INTERESTED ENDS, MIGHT BE DOING MORE FOR SOCIETY.
YOU1000000116_S0000015	THAN IF ANY OF THEM ACTUALLY TRY TO PROMOTE THE OVERALL WELL BEING OF SOCIETY. AND I DON'T THINK ADAM SMITH WOULD SAY THAT IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
YOU1000000116_S0000016	FOR SOMEONE TO ACT SELF INTERESTED, OR THAT IT'S NEVER GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN AN AGGREGATE SENSE. BUT HE'S SAYING THAT FREQUENTLY,
YOU1000000116_S0000017	FREQUENTLY, THIS SELF INTERESTED ACTION COULD LEAD TO THE GREATER GOOD, COULD LEAD TO MORE INNOVATION, COULD LEAD TO BETTER INVESTMENT,
YOU1000000116_S0000018	COULD LEAD TO MORE PRODUCTIVITY, COULD LEAD TO MORE WEALTH, A LARGER PIE FOR EVERYONE.
YOU1000000116_S0000019	AND NOW ECONOMICS IS FREQUENTLY, AND WHEN HE MAKES A STATEMENT, HE'S ACTUALLY MAKING A MIX OF A MICROECONOMIC AND A MACROECONOMIC STATEMENT.
YOU1000000116_S0000020	MICRO IS THAT PEOPLE, INDIVIDUAL ACTORS, ARE ACTING IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST. AND THE MACRO IS THAT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY OR FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE.
YOU1000000116_S0000021	AND SO NOW MODERN ECONOMISTS TEND TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO THESE TWO SCHOOLS OR INTO THESE TWO SUBJECTS.
YOU1000000116_S0000023	MICROECONOMICS, WHICH IS THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL ACTORS. AND THOSE ACTORS COULD BE FIRMS, IT COULD BE PEOPLE, IT COULD BE HOUSEHOLDS.
YOU1000000116_S0000024	AND YOU HAVE MACROECONOMICS, WHICH IS THE STUDY OF THE ECONOMY IN AGGREGATE. MACRO.
YOU1000000116_S0000026	ECONOMICS. AND YOU GET IT FROM THEIR WORDS.
YOU1000000116_S0000027	SO MICRO, THE PREFIX, REFERS TO VERY SMALL THINGS. MACRO REFERS TO THE LARGER, THE BIGGER PICTURE. AND SO MICROECONOMICS, JUST TO RESTATE IT, IS ESSENTIALLY
YOU1000000116_S0000028	HOW ACTORS MAKE DECISIONS, OR I GUESS WE COULD SAY ALLOCATIONS, DECISIONS SLASH
YOU1000000116_S0000029	ALLOCATIONS OF SCARCE RESOURCES. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THE WORD SCARCE RESOURCES A LOT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ECONOMICS.
YOU1000000116_S0000030	AND A SCARCE RESOURCE IS ONE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF. FOR EXAMPLE, LOVE MIGHT NOT BE A SCARCE RESOURCE. YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF LOVE.
YOU1000000116_S0000031	BUT A RESOURCE THAT WOULD BE SCARCE IS SOMETHING LIKE FOOD, OR WATER, OR MONEY, OR TIME, OR LABOR. THESE ARE ALL SCARCE RESOURCES.
YOU1000000116_S0000032	AND SO MICROECONOMICS IS, WELL, HOW DO PEOPLE DECIDE WHERE TO PUT THOSE SCARCE RESOURCES? HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHERE TO DEPLOY THEM? AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT PRICES AND MARKETS AND WHATEVER ELSE?
YOU1000000116_S0000033	MACROECONOMICS IS A STUDY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN AGGREGATE TO AN ECONOMY.
YOU1000000116_S0000034	TO AN ECONOMY FROM THE MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUAL ACTORS. AGGREGATE ECONOMY. WE NOW HAVE MILLIONS.
YOU1000000116_S0000035	MILLIONS OF ACTORS. AND IT OFTEN FOCUSES ON POLICY RELATED QUESTIONS. SO DO YOU RAISE OR LOWER TAXES, OR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU RAISE OR LOWER TAXES?
YOU1000000116_S0000036	DO YOU REGULATE OR DEREGULATE? HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY WHEN YOU DO THESE? SO IT'S POLICY.
YOU1000000116_S0000037	TOP DOWN QUESTIONS. AND IN BOTH MACRO AND MICROECONOMICS, ESPECIALLY IN THE MODERN SENSE OF IT,
YOU1000000116_S0000039	THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEM RIGOROUS, TO MAKE THEM MATHEMATICAL. SO IN EITHER CASE, YOU CAN START WITH SOME OF THE IDEAS, SOME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS OR THE LOGICAL IDEAS.
YOU1000000116_S0000040	THAT SAY SOMEONE LIKE AN ADAM SMITH MIGHT HAVE. SO YOU HAVE THESE, AND THERE ARE BASIC IDEAS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THINK, HOW PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS.
YOU1000000116_S0000041	SO PHILOSOPHY OF PEOPLE OF DECISION MAKING, IN THE CASE OF MICROECONOMICS, DECISION MAKING,
YOU1000000116_S0000042	AND THEN YOU MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT IT, OR YOU SIMPLIFY IT. SO I'LL DO IT LIKE THIS. YOU SIMPLIFY IT.
YOU1000000116_S0000043	AND YOU REALLY ARE SIMPLIFYING. YOU SAY, OH, ALL PEOPLE ARE RATIONAL, OR ALL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ACT IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST, OR ALL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAXIMIZE THEIR GAIN, WHICH ISN'T TRUE.
YOU1000000116_S0000044	HUMAN BEINGS ARE MOTIVATED BY A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS. BUT YOU SIMPLIFY THESE THINGS SO THAT YOU CAN START TO DEAL WITH IT IN KIND OF A MATHEMATICAL WAY.
YOU1000000116_S0000045	SO YOU SIMPLIFY IT SO YOU CAN START DEALING WITH IT IN A MATHEMATICAL SENSE. AND THIS IS VALUABLE. IT CAN CLARIFY YOUR THINKING. IT CAN ALLOW YOU TO PROVE THINGS.
YOU1000000116_S0000046	BASED ON YOUR ASSUMPTIONS. AND SO YOU CAN START TO VISUALIZE THINGS MATHEMATICALLY WITH CHARTS AND GRAPHS AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN WITH THE MARKETS.
YOU1000000116_S0000047	SO IT'S VERY, VERY VALUABLE TO HAVE THIS MATHEMATICAL RIGOROUS THINKING. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING THIS HUGE SIMPLIFICATION.
YOU1000000116_S0000048	AND SOMETIMES THE MATH MIGHT LEAD YOU TO SOME VERY STRONG CONCLUSIONS, WHICH YOU MIGHT FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE PROVEN THEM.
YOU1000000116_S0000049	THE SAME WAY THAT YOU MIGHT PROVE RELATIVITY, BUT THEY WERE BASED ON SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT EITHER MIGHT BE WRONG OR MIGHT BE OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS OR MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT.
YOU1000000116_S0000050	TO THE CONTEXT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT. SO IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE IT ALL WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S ALL BASED ON SOME SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS.
YOU1000000116_S0000051	AND MACROECONOMICS IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE GUILTY OF IT. IN MICROECONOMICS, YOU'RE TAKING THESE DEEPLY COMPLICATED THINGS, THE HUMAN BRAIN, HOW PEOPLE ACT AND RESPOND TO EACH OTHER.
YOU1000000116_S0000052	AND THEN YOU'RE AGGREGATING IT OVER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. SO IT'S ULTRA COMPLICATED. YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF THESE INFINITELY COMPLICATED PEOPLE ALL INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER.
YOU1000000116_S0000053	IT'S VERY COMPLICATED. MILLIONS OF INTERACTIONS AND FUNDAMENTALLY UNPREDICTABLE INTERACTIONS AND THEN TRYING TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ON THOSE.
YOU1000000116_S0000054	TRYING TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS, AND THEN DOING MATH WITH THAT, THAT COULD LEAD YOU TO SOME CONCLUSIONS OR MIGHT LEAD YOU TO SOME PREDICTIONS.
YOU1000000116_S0000055	AND ONCE AGAIN, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THIS IS VALUABLE. IT'S VALUABLE TO MAKE THESE MATHEMATICAL MODELS, TO MAKE THESE MATHEMATICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THESE MATHEMATICAL CONCLUSIONS.
YOU1000000116_S0000056	BUT IT ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. AND SO THAT YOU HAVE A PROPER GRAIN OF SALT, AND SO THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS FOCUSED ON THE TRUE INTUITION,
YOU1000000116_S0000057	AND THAT'S REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GET FROM A COURSE OF ECONOMICS, SO THAT YOU CAN TRULY REASON THROUGH WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN, MAYBE EVEN WITHOUT THE MATHEMATICS.
YOU1000000116_S0000058	I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH TWO QUOTES, AND THESE QUOTES ARE A LITTLE BIT FUNNY, BUT THEY REALLY, I THINK, ARE HELPFUL THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU START TO ESPECIALLY GO DEEP INTO THE MATHEMATICAL SIDE.
YOU1000000116_S0000059	OF ECONOMICS. SO THIS RIGHT OVER HERE IS A QUOTE BY ALFRED KNOPF, WHO WAS A PUBLISHER IN THE 1900S.
YOU1000000116_S0000060	AN ECONOMIST IS A MAN WHO STATES THE OBVIOUS IN TERMS OF THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE. AND I'M ASSUMING WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE, HE'S REFERRING TO SOME OF THE MATHY STUFF THAT YOU SEE.
YOU1000000116_S0000061	IN ECONOMICS AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL MAKE THIS AS COMPREHENSIBLE AS POSSIBLE AND SEE THAT THERE IS VALUE IN THIS. BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT HE'S MAKING.
YOU1000000116_S0000062	OFTENTIMES, IT'S STATING A COMMON SENSE THING. IT'S STATING SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUS. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS KEEP THAT IN MIND.
YOU1000000116_S0000063	TO ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE INTUITION FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MATH, OR TO KNOW WHEN THE MATH IS GOING IN A DIRECTION THAT MIGHT BE STRANGE BASED ON OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS.
YOU1000000116_S0000064	OR WRONG ASSUMPTIONS. AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS QUOTE OVER HERE BY LAWRENCE J. PETER, MOST FAMOUS FOR PETER'S PRINCIPLES, A PROFESSOR AT USC.
YOU1000000116_S0000065	AN ECONOMIST IS AN EXPERT WHO WILL KNOW TOMORROW WHY THE THINGS HE PREDICTED YESTERDAY DIDN'T HAPPEN TODAY. AND ONCE AGAIN, IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN THE BACK OF ONE'S MIND.
YOU1000000116_S0000066	BECAUSE ESPECIALLY, AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO MACROECONOMICS, BECAUSE IN MACROECONOMICS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY.
YOU1000000116_S0000067	WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, HOW LONG WILL THE RECESSION LAST, WHAT WILL BE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH NEXT YEAR, WHAT WILL INFLATION DO, AND THEY OFTEN PROVE TO BE WRONG.
YOU1000000116_S0000068	IN FACT, FEW ECONOMISTS EVEN TEND TO AGREE ON MANY OF THESE THINGS. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT, BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU'RE DEEP IN THE MATHEMATICS OF THE ECONOMICS, IT MIGHT SEEM
YOU1000000116_S0000069	TO BE A SCIENCE LIKE PHYSICS, BUT IT'S NOT A SCIENCE LIKE PHYSICS. IT IS OPEN TO SUBJECTIVITY.
YOU1000000116_S0000070	AND A LOT OF THAT SUBJECTIVITY IS ALL AROUND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE.
YOU1000000117_S0000000	ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE'RE AT TIME. SO LET'S GET STARTED. WELCOME TO FOLKS. I DON'T KNOW. I'M DR. LORI SANTOS, A PROFESSOR HERE AT YALE UNIVERSITY.
YOU1000000117_S0000001	AND THE TEACHER OF THE SCIENCE OF WELLBEING COURSE ON COURSERA.ORG AND A HOST OF THE HAPPINESS LAB PODCAST.
YOU1000000117_S0000002	WE WANTED TO DO THIS FACEBOOK LIVE EVENT TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH COVID 19.
YOU1000000117_S0000003	AND ALL THE ANXIETIES AND THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT COME WITH IT. WE KNOW OF COURSE ALL THE PHYSICAL THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH, RIGHT? WE SHOULD BE WASHING OUR HANDS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING AND SO ON.
YOU1000000117_S0000004	BUT I THINK A LOT OF US ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW WITH THE KINDS OF THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR MENTAL HEALTH.
YOU1000000117_S0000005	AND WE NEED TO BE JUST AS INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROTECTING OUR OWN ANXIETIES AND DEPRESSIONS AND SORT OF FIXING THAT AS WE ARE PROTECTING OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH.
YOU1000000117_S0000006	AND THIS CALL TODAY IS TO ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT SCIENCE SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN DO TO PROMOTE OUR MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000007	WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS ANSWERING ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS, SO PLEASE BE SENDING THEM IN ON THE SIDE.
YOU1000000117_S0000008	IF YOU HAVEN'T YET, SEND US AN EMOJI TO LET US KNOW YOU'RE THERE. PLEASE LET US KNOW.
YOU1000000117_S0000009	AND I THINK SINCE WE HAVE SUCH A SHORT TIME, I THINK WE'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP RIGHT INTO IT.
YOU1000000117_S0000010	YOU'LL SEE ME KIND OF LOOKING OVER AT THE SIDE ON MY CHAT SCREEN TO SEE WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE.
YOU1000000117_S0000011	AND THE FIRST QUESTION WE HAVE TODAY IS FROM ELIZABETH, WHO ASKS, DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ON DEALING WITH OR REDUCING TENSION AND ARGUING IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP DURING THESE STAY AT HOME ORDERS?
YOU1000000117_S0000012	THIS ONE'S A BIG ONE. I THINK YOU'RE SPEAKING TO ME. I THINK A LOT OF US ARE FACING THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000117_S0000013	THAT WE'RE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH OUR SPOUSES, WITH OUR PARTNERS, WITH OUR KIDS.
YOU1000000117_S0000014	AND THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING NORMALLY, BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING IN AN OTHERWISE ANXIETY PROVOKING TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000015	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE I HAVE IS TO JUST VALIDATE THAT LIKE, YEAH, THIS IS A BIG THING THAT WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING WITH.
YOU1000000117_S0000016	BUT THEN TO SORT OF ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BE A LITTLE BIT PATIENT.
YOU1000000117_S0000017	THE RESEARCH ON RELATIONSHIPS AND WHAT ALLOWS RELATIONSHIPS TO SUCCEED, FOLKS LIKE PROFESSOR ELI FINKEL AND OTHERS,
YOU1000000117_S0000018	THEY REALLY SUGGEST THAT A LOT OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS SUCCESS HAS TO DO WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS.
YOU1000000117_S0000019	AND I THINK IF ANYTHING, WE MIGHT WANT TO JUST BE A LITTLE CHILLER ABOUT OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR SPOUSES THAN WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE.
YOU1000000117_S0000020	ALL OF US ARE GOING THROUGH THIS STRUGGLING TIME. AND SO IF YOU HAVE A SPOUSE WHO SAY, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER OR ISN'T DOING THEIR PART AS MUCH WITH KIDS.
YOU1000000117_S0000021	I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO BE COMPASSIONATE BOTH WITH THEM AND WITH YOURSELF.
YOU1000000117_S0000022	AND TO KIND OF DOWNGRADE EXPECTATIONS A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000117_S0000023	BUT THE PARTICULAR ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SPOUSE, THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS THAT WE REALLY LOVE ABOUT OUR SPOUSE THAT IN A RELATIONSHIP WE DO VERY, VERY WELL TOGETHER.
YOU1000000117_S0000024	AND THIS IS THE TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE GOOD THINGS.
YOU1000000117_S0000025	SO IF YOU BOTH CONNECT IN TERMS OF HANGING OUT WITH THE KIDS AND WORKING WITH THE KIDS, THAT'S A TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT.
YOU1000000117_S0000026	IF YOU BOTH CONNECT ON HUMOR, NOW'S THE TIME TO BE WATCHING A COMEDY MOVIE TOGETHER.
YOU1000000117_S0000027	AND SO THE BASIC ADVICE IS TO KIND OF SHOW THEM AND YOURSELF A LITTLE COMPASSION, LIKE NOW IS THE TIME TO KIND OF DOWN REGULATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS.
YOU1000000117_S0000028	BUT ALSO, IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP, BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROMOTING THOSE IN THIS TOUGH TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000029	AND THAT SOMETIMES REQUIRES A LITTLE CREATIVITY. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE, YOU THINK YOU'RE GREAT WITH, WITH YOUR SPOUSE IS GOING OUT TO DINNER AND HAVING THESE WONDERFUL OUTDOOR DATES.
YOU1000000117_S0000030	YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET CREATIVE, BUT WITH A LITTLE CREATIVITY YOU CAN REALLY PATCH UP A RELATIONSHIP.
YOU1000000117_S0000031	AND KIND OF DOWN REGULATE THE STRESS THAT WE SEE.
YOU1000000117_S0000032	REMEMBER, IN NATURAL DISASTERS, IT IS A TIME THAT WE SEE THINGS LIKE DIVORCE RATES INCREASING.
YOU1000000117_S0000033	BUT IT'S ALSO THE TIME THAT WE SEE NEW RELATIONSHIPS FORMING, PEOPLE MAKING BABIES.
YOU1000000117_S0000034	IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR INTENTIONAL EFFORTS. YOU CAN MAKE THIS CHALLENGING TIME BETTER IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
YOU1000000117_S0000035	SO THAT WAS ELIZABETH'S QUESTION. NEXT QUESTION WE HAVE UP IS FROM MELISSA.
YOU1000000117_S0000036	SHE ASKS, HOW DO WE STAY INFORMED WITH CURRENT AND UPDATED NEWS WITHOUT INCREASING OUR ANXIOUS FEELINGS WE MAY HAVE?
YOU1000000117_S0000037	THIS IS ANOTHER ONE I'M STRUGGLING WITH AS WELL. LIKE YOU, I WANT TO BE INFORMED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY TOWN, WHAT HAS THE PRESIDENT SAID RECENTLY, AND SO ON.
YOU1000000117_S0000038	BUT I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME I WATCH THE NEWS I CAN WATCH MY ANXIETY SKYROCKET.
YOU1000000117_S0000039	IN TERMS OF WHAT ANXIETY FEELS LIKE IN THE BODY. FOR ME, THAT'S WATCHING MY CHEST CONSTRICT. I'M WATCHING MYSELF BREATHE FASTER. IT JUST KIND OF DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.
YOU1000000117_S0000040	AND SO THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE OF HOW TO STAY INFORMED WITHOUT CREATING MORE ANXIETY.
YOU1000000117_S0000041	THE WAY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE IT MYSELF IS TO KIND OF DO THAT PAYING ATTENTION, THAT MINDFULNESS ABOUT WHAT THE NEWS IS MAKING ME FEEL.
YOU1000000117_S0000042	AND THERE'S TIMES WHEN IT FEELS LIKE INFORMATION AND THERE'S TIMES WHEN IT FEELS LIKE I'M ALREADY REALLY ANXIOUS.
YOU1000000117_S0000043	I DON'T WANT TO ADD TO THAT BY ADDING ANY MORE NEWS ONTO IT.
YOU1000000117_S0000044	AND SO I THINK THE KEY IS TO JUST BE REALLY DELIBERATE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE CONSUMING.
YOU1000000117_S0000045	AND ALSO TO HAVE SOME CHOICE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE CONSUMING. YOU CAN PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT TRY TO UPREGULATE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE POSITIVE NEWS.
YOU1000000117_S0000046	SO FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S A WONDERFUL HASHTAG ON TWITTER CALLED COVIDKINDNESS, WHICH YOU CAN USE TO CHECK OUT TO SEE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE.
YOU1000000117_S0000047	AND SO I THINK TRYING TO BALANCE SOME OF THE DOOM AND GLOOM THAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH SOME OF THE POSITIVE THINGS CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000117_S0000048	BUT HONESTLY, WHAT I'VE DONE MYSELF IS TO REALLY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEWS THAT I'M CONSUMING.
YOU1000000117_S0000049	PARTICULARLY BEFORE I GO TO BED. I NOW HAVE A RULE OF LIKE BASICALLY PAST 6 OR 7 P.M.
YOU1000000117_S0000050	I PUT MY PHONE AWAY. I'M NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS MUCH. I'M REALLY TRYING TO NOT BE CONSUMING THE NEWS AT THAT TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000051	BECAUSE I'M WATCHING IT MINDFULLY AND NOTICING THAT IT'S AFFECTING MY SLEEP.
YOU1000000117_S0000052	MOST OF THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE THERE THE NEXT MORNING. AND SO FIND WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR SLEEP AND TO PROTECT YOUR OWN ANXIETY LEVELS.
YOU1000000117_S0000053	AND IT'S OKAY TO BE SELF COMPASSIONATE IF YOU NEED TO AVOID SOME OF THAT STUFF.
YOU1000000117_S0000054	AGAIN, THE 24 HOUR NEWS CYCLE IS GOING TO BE BACK WHEN YOU LOOK AGAIN. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS TOO MUCH.
YOU1000000117_S0000056	NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM A BUNCH OF FOLKS, LEE AND JENNA AND ANNA, ALL ASKING SIMILAR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS.
YOU1000000117_S0000057	THEY ASK BASICALLY HOW CAN FRONTLINE WORKERS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS GENERALLY PRACTICE SELF CARE AND COMBAT ANXIETY? WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THESE WORKERS?
YOU1000000117_S0000058	I'M SO GLAD THIS QUESTION CAME UP AND IT'S GREAT THAT IT CAME UP FROM SO MANY FOLKS.
YOU1000000117_S0000059	BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I CARE ABOUT VERY DEEPLY. I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THERE ARE HEALTH CARE WORKERS OUT THERE REALLY RISKING THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVES.
YOU1000000117_S0000060	TO PROTECT ME AND MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY. AND SO THANK YOU WITH GRATITUDE FOR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT.
YOU1000000117_S0000061	I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF INTENTIONAL THINGS THAT EVEN FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINE CAN DO TO PROTECT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS SCARY TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000062	ONE OF THOSE THINGS COMES FROM A REFOCUS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO PROTECT YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS DURING THIS TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000063	AND THAT MEANS EXPLICITLY TAKING TIME TO KIND OF PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR ANXIETY LEVELS AND WATCH THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO DEAL WITH THAT.
YOU1000000117_S0000064	I THINK IN BETWEEN PATIENTS, IF YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK FOR SAY THREE CONSCIOUS BREATHS,
YOU1000000117_S0000065	THREE VERY SLOW BREATHS WHERE YOU BREATHE INTO YOUR BELLY.
YOU1000000117_S0000066	AND JUST KIND OF HAVE A MOMENT TO TAKE A SECOND AND BE PRESENT.
YOU1000000117_S0000067	THOSE THINGS WILL DOWN REGULATE YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. IT'LL KICK IN THE PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY THAT WE KNOW ALLOWS FOR KIND OF A REST AND DIGEST.
YOU1000000117_S0000068	AND THE MORE YOU CAN SORT OF TAKE SHORT BREAKS TO DO THAT, ALL THE MORE POWERFUL.
YOU1000000117_S0000069	I THINK A SECOND THING I WOULD SAY FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE REFRAMING WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN AS POSITIVE A WAY AS POSSIBLE.
YOU1000000117_S0000070	I MEAN, ULTIMATELY YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY BRAVE THAT'S HELPING FOLKS, BUT SOMETIMES IN THE FRANTIC DAY TO DAY ANXIOUSNESS OF THAT YOU CAN LOSE THAT.
YOU1000000117_S0000071	AND THERE'S LOTS OF RESEARCH BY FOLKS LIKE DAVID DISTENO AND OTHERS THAT SHOWS THAT TAKING TIME TO REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS COMPASSIONATELY HELPING OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU1000000117_S0000072	RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S A PRO SOCIAL ACTION, CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE RESILIENCE AND IT CAN ACTUALLY UP REGULATE WHAT'S CALLED YOUR SELF REGULATION, YOUR ABILITY TO DO HARD THINGS.
YOU1000000117_S0000073	AND SO I THINK KIND OF TURNING ON YOUR COMPASSION MUSCLES, TURNING ON THIS IDEA THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING PRO SOCIALLY CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000117_S0000074	AND THE FINAL QUICK TIP, THIS IS MORE OF A PRACTICE TIP, BUT FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS RIGHT NOW IS THAT
YOU1000000117_S0000075	THERE'S LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT SPECIFIC KINDS OF MEDITATION PRACTICES CAN REDUCE BURNOUT EVEN IN INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL TIMES.
YOU1000000117_S0000076	AND THIS IS TRUE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS, BUT ALSO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EVEN FOLKS LIKE WHO WORK AT THE GROCERY STORE WHO REALLY HAVE TO GIVE UP AND SACRIFICE RIGHT NOW TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU1000000117_S0000077	AND THIS SPECIFIC KIND OF MEDITATION IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION OR METTA.
YOU1000000117_S0000078	IT'S BASICALLY A MEDITATION PRACTICE WHERE YOU WORK ON PRACTICING COMPASSION. YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE.
YOU1000000117_S0000079	AND EXTEND TO THEM INFORMATION ABOUT BEING HAPPY AND HEALTHY.
YOU1000000117_S0000080	YOU ACTUALLY USE A MANTRA OF MAY YOU BE HAPPY, MAY YOU BE HEALTHY.
YOU1000000117_S0000081	BUT THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE SIMPLE ACT OF DOING THIS, EVEN REALLY TEMPORARILY, CAN ALLOW YOU TO FEEL COMPASSION, THIS URGE TO HELP PEOPLE, WITHOUT THE EMPATHY THAT GOES WITH IT.
YOU1000000117_S0000082	IN OTHER WORDS, WITHOUT THE KIND OF BURNOUT THAT COMES FROM FEELING THOSE OTHER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS.
YOU1000000117_S0000083	I THINK THIS CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TECHNIQUE FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN START IT TODAY.
YOU1000000117_S0000084	LOTS OF FREE APPS ONLINE FROM INSIGHT TIMER TO CALM TO EVEN 10% HAPPIER WITH DAN HARRIS THERE.
YOU1000000117_S0000085	ALLOWING HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO USE THESE THINGS FREELY, AVAILABLE.
YOU1000000117_S0000086	AND THEY'RE ALLOWING THOSE HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO ACCESS LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION SPECIFICALLY.
YOU1000000117_S0000087	SO JUMP ON AND DO ONE OF THESE MEDITATIONS, EVEN FOR FIVE MINUTES IN THE MORNING, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE TAKING YOUR SHOWER.
YOU1000000117_S0000088	IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN REALLY IMPROVE YOUR KIND OF RESILIENCE AND PROTECT YOU FROM BURNOUT LATER ON.
YOU1000000117_S0000089	OKAY, SO THAT WAS ABOUT HEALTHCARE WORKERS. NOW WE HAVE A NEW QUESTION FROM TRACY.
YOU1000000117_S0000090	TRACY ASKS, HOW DO YOU KEEP YOURSELF POSITIVE DURING THIS TIME WHEN LIVING ALONE, WHEN YOU'RE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS?
YOU1000000117_S0000091	I THINK THIS ONE IS THE FLIP SIDE OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE STRESS OF LIVING WITH YOUR SPOUSE.
YOU1000000117_S0000092	THERE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRESS THAT COMES FROM LIVING ALONE AND BEING AWAY FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THIS REALLY HARD TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000093	AND I THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE IS THAT YOU CAN BE PHYSICALLY ALONE WITHOUT BEING SOCIALLY ALONE.
YOU1000000117_S0000094	IN OTHER WORDS, YOU CAN BE USING TECHNOLOGY TO REACH OUT TO ALL THOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS.
YOU1000000117_S0000095	AND I THINK IN THIS SCARY TIME, WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS EVEN MORE THAN EVER AND EVEN MORE INTENTIONALLY THAN EVER.
YOU1000000117_S0000096	YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF BE HOME ALONE, BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, ZOOM YOGA CLASSES WITH FRIENDS OF YOURS.
YOU1000000117_S0000097	OR A ZOOM DINNER DATE WITH YOUR PARENTS WHO ARE FAR AWAY IN DIFFERENT TIME ZONES.
YOU1000000117_S0000098	THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU CAN BUILD INTO YOUR DAY, EVEN IF YOU'RE LIVING ALONE. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL.
YOU1000000117_S0000099	ONE THING TO KNOW IS THAT THE SCIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE ACT OF INTENTIONALLY CONNECTING IN REAL TIME, YOU KNOW, KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WHERE WE'RE I'M TALKING TO YOU AND YOU'RE HEARING ME IN REAL TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000100	THAT CAN BE ALMOST AS GOOD AS A REGULAR SOCIAL CONNECTION. AND SO WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING THESE A LOT MORE.
YOU1000000117_S0000101	I THINK ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE LIVING ALONE IS TO EMBRACE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SOLITUDE GIVES YOU IN TERMS OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS.
YOU1000000117_S0000102	SO I'M THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE QUIET TIME FOR MEDITATION.
YOU1000000117_S0000103	OR EVEN ALONE TIME SO THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE EXERCISE, YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000117_S0000104	GRAB A YOGA MAT EVEN FROM A SMALL APARTMENT AND DO ONE OF THE MANY FREE ONLINE EXERCISE CLASSES THAT ARE COMING NOW.
YOU1000000117_S0000105	I THINK IF YOU'RE ALONE IN THIS CRISIS, IT CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME TIME TO RESET THINGS AND FOCUS ON YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH.
YOU1000000117_S0000106	IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE TRICKY IF YOU'RE NOT SORT OF SHELTERING IN PLACE IN THAT VERY STRANGE SITUATION.
YOU1000000117_S0000108	AND SO THAT WAS TRACY'S QUESTION. NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO BREE. BREE IS ASKING, HOW CAN WE STAY FOCUSED, SANE, AND PRODUCTIVE AT WORK?
YOU1000000117_S0000109	PARTICULARLY WITH THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, WHICH IS THE THREAT OF LAYOFFS.
YOU1000000117_S0000110	THIS IS ANOTHER REALLY HUGE ONE AND I THINK I WANT TO START WITH THIS QUESTION FIRST BY VALIDATING IT.
YOU1000000117_S0000111	YEAH, A LOT OF US ARE FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING LAID OFF FROM WORK, HAVING LESS HOURS.
YOU1000000117_S0000112	IN ADDITION TO THIS PHYSICAL CRISIS AND THIS MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, A LOT OF US ARE FACING A REAL ECONOMIC CRISIS, AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY SCARY.
YOU1000000117_S0000113	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THING IS TO JUST HAVE SOME SELF COMPASSION WITH YOURSELF ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS.
YOU1000000117_S0000114	I'M EXPERIENCING THIS NOW WITH MANY OF MY GRADUATE AND PHD STUDENTS.
YOU1000000117_S0000115	WHO FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE WORKING AND BEING JUST AS PRODUCTIVE AS BEFORE, BUT THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC WHERE EVERYONE IS STRESSED.
YOU1000000117_S0000116	AND EVEN IF WE'RE REACTING TO IT REALLY WELL ONE DAY, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE NEXT DAY WE WON'T FEEL IT REALLY DEEPLY AND BE UNABLE TO WORK.
YOU1000000117_S0000117	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE IS JUST TO ALLOW YOURSELF SOME SELF COMPASSION.
YOU1000000117_S0000118	YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE SAME SELF COMPASSION AS YOU WOULD GIVE TO A FRIEND WHO IS GOING THROUGH THAT SORT OF SAME THING.
YOU1000000117_S0000119	ALL OF US RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE LESS PRODUCTIVE THAN USUAL.
YOU1000000117_S0000120	THE SECOND PIECE OF ADVICE IS ACTUALLY TO REMEMBER SOME OF THE CAUSAL ARROWS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ON THE PODCAST AND IN MY CLASS.
YOU1000000117_S0000121	IN OTHER WORDS, THAT WE OFTEN THINK THAT PRODUCTIVITY WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT FIRST AND THEN WE'LL BE HAPPY BECAUSE WE'LL BE PRODUCTIVE AT WORK.
YOU1000000117_S0000122	BUT THE RESEARCH ACTUALLY SUGGESTS THE OTHER ARROW. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT BY FOCUSING ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH DURING THIS TIME, IT CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE OUR PRODUCTIVITY.
YOU1000000117_S0000123	AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE DIRECTION I SUGGEST YOU THINK ABOUT GOING. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO REDUCE YOUR ANXIETY RIGHT NOW?
YOU1000000117_S0000124	TO BUMP UP YOUR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS SO YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE CONNECTED AND TRUSTING ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY.
YOU1000000117_S0000125	WHAT CAN YOU DO TO INCREASE A LITTLE BIT OF EXERCISE LATELY? THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WILL BUMP UP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH.
YOU1000000117_S0000126	AND BY FOCUSING ON THAT, YOU'LL END UP INCREASING YOUR PRODUCTIVITY SEPARATELY.
YOU1000000117_S0000127	AND SO THOSE WOULD BE MY KIND OF PRODUCTIVITY TIPS. FIRST OF ALL, JUST LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME.
YOU1000000117_S0000128	NO ONE'S IS GOING TO BE THE SAME AND IN SOME WAYS THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN THIS BOAT.
YOU1000000117_S0000129	SO KIND OF LAY OFF YOURSELF OF THE GUILT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF ALL GOING THROUGH IT.
YOU1000000117_S0000130	AND THE SECOND IS THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY, YOU NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME SPACE TO DO THE THINGS THAT WILL REALLY HELP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH TOO.
YOU1000000117_S0000131	OKAY, SO THAT WAS FROM BRIE. NOW WE HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION FROM ANGELA WHO'S ASKED, MAYBE MORE SPECIFICALLY, I'VE BEEN LAID OFF BECAUSE OF COVID 19.
YOU1000000117_S0000132	HOW DO I DO THE SOUL SEARCHING NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO NEXT AND WHAT JOBS AND INDUSTRIES ARE GOING TO BE FULFILLING?
YOU1000000117_S0000133	I THINK AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF THESE WAYS OF USING THE NEGATIVE THINGS IN LIFE TO SORT OF SEE THE BLESSINGS INSIDE OF THEM.
YOU1000000117_S0000134	AGAIN, LOSING YOUR JOB IS AN AWFUL THING TO HAVE HAPPEN AND IT COMES WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES.
YOU1000000117_S0000135	BUT IT ALSO BRINGS WITH IT THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW DIRECTIONS.
YOU1000000117_S0000136	LIKE YOU CAN START THINKING MORE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU FOUND MEANINGFUL ABOUT YOUR JOB.
YOU1000000117_S0000137	WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUILD INTO A JOB THAT'S COMING NEXT?
YOU1000000117_S0000138	AGAIN, SO MANY OF US ARE IN THIS CRISIS RIGHT NOW AND GOING THROUGH THESE THINGS.
YOU1000000117_S0000139	BUT ALSO ALL OF US OR MOST OF US ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU1000000117_S0000140	WHEN WE'RE IN THE CRUX OF IT, IT'S HARD TO THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SIDE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST FACING UNCERTAINTY OF KIND OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S INSIDE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.
YOU1000000117_S0000141	BUT LIKE ALL CRISES, WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU1000000117_S0000142	AND EVEN THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOING THROUGH ECONOMIC AND OTHER STRIFE RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO FIND OTHER OPTIONS WHEN YOU GET OUT.
YOU1000000117_S0000143	AND I THINK YOU CAN USE THIS TIME TO DO SOME REAL SOUL SEARCHING.
YOU1000000117_S0000144	ONE OF THE BLESSINGS OF BEING IN A POSITION OF MAYBE LOSING YOUR JOB OR LOSING SOME HOURS AT WORK
YOU1000000117_S0000145	IS THAT YOU WIND UP HAVING A TIME WINDFALL. YOU WIND UP HAVING MORE TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000146	AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE BLESSING OF HAVING WHAT'S CALLED TIME AFFLUENCE, THE SORT OF FEELING OF BEING WEALTHY IN TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000147	IF YOU CAN KIND OF GET AROUND THE UNCERTAINTY OF HAVING THE EXTRA TIME, IT CAN ACTUALLY BE A REALLY POWERFUL TIME TO DO THINGS LIKE TAKE TIME TO JOURNAL ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND MOST MEANINGFUL.
YOU1000000117_S0000148	OR ENGAGE IN THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT RESEARCHERS LIKE AMY REZNICKI AND OTHERS USE TO JOB CRAFT.
YOU1000000117_S0000149	TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND MOST MEANINGFUL IN YOUR WORK AND SORT OF PLAN THAT MOVING FORWARD.
YOU1000000117_S0000150	IF YOU'RE TAKING THE CLASS, ANGELA, I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GO BACK TO THAT STRENGTHS TEST THAT YOU MIGHT RECALL.
YOU1000000117_S0000151	TRYING TO FOCUS ON YOUR CHARACTER STRENGTHS AND GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT THOSE ARE, THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PARTS OF YOUR WORK ARE MAPPING ON TO THOSE STRENGTHS.
YOU1000000117_S0000152	AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE FUTURE, WHAT YOU COULD DO THAT KIND OF BUILDS THOSE UP IN AN EVEN MORE ROBUST WAY.
YOU1000000117_S0000153	OKAY, SO THAT WAS A QUESTION FROM ANGELA. WE'RE CRUISING THROUGH ALL THESE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENDING IN ALL THESE GREAT ONES.
YOU1000000117_S0000154	THE NEXT ONE UP IS FROM JESSICA. JESSICA NOTES, I'VE BEEN DOING OKAY SO FAR, BUT ONE OF MY CHILDREN HAS BEEN REALLY SAD ABOUT MISSING SCHOOL AND HIS FRIENDS. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN HELP HIM?
YOU1000000117_S0000155	AND AGAIN, JUST START BY JUST VALIDATING THIS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A SCARY AND UNCERTAIN AND AN ANXIETY PROVOKING TIME FOR US.
YOU1000000117_S0000156	IT'S SO MUCH WORSE FOR OUR CHILDREN, RIGHT, WHO REALLY JUST DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF FRONTAL LOBE TOOLS TO REGULATE ABOUT THIS CRISIS.
YOU1000000117_S0000157	AND SO I THINK ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEIR ANXIETY, THEIR UNCERTAINTY CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000117_S0000158	THE FIRST TIP I WOULD GIVE FOR HELPING KIDS DURING THIS TOUGH TIME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A ROUTINE.
YOU1000000117_S0000159	ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ABOUT BEING OUT OF SCHOOL AND OUT OF THE TYPICAL DAY THAT KIDS FACE IS THAT THEY'RE USED TO HAVING A CERTAIN ROUTINE AND NOW IT'S GONE AWAY.
YOU1000000117_S0000160	AND WE AS HUMANS ARE CREATURES OF HABIT. LIKE WE KIND OF WORK BEST AND FEEL LESS ANXIOUS WHEN WE'RE IN A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE AND A CONSISTENT ROUTINE.
YOU1000000117_S0000162	SO EVEN IF YOUR KIDS AREN'T IN A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE RIGHT NOW, YOU SHOULD MAKE ONE UP FOR THEM.
YOU1000000117_S0000163	YOU SHOULD FIND A WAY THAT, YOU KNOW, LIKE BREAKFASTS FROM 9 TO 10 AND FROM 10 TO 11.
YOU1000000117_S0000164	YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR MATH HOMEWORK OR MAYBE YOU'RE WATCHING CARTOONS OR MAYBE YOU GET TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES IT KIND OF DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU1000000117_S0000165	BUT JUST HAVE A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE THAT YOU END UP KIND OF ANNOUNCING TO YOUR KIDS AND STICKING WITH.
YOU1000000117_S0000166	THE OTHER PIECE OF ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS AGAIN TO DO THE SAME THING THAT WE NEED TO DO WHEN WE'RE FEELING ANXIOUS AND WE'RE FEELING STRESSED AND WE'RE FEELING SAD. IN OTHER WORDS, THE SAME TYPES OF TIPS I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT.
YOU1000000117_S0000167	KIDS TOO CAN BENEFIT FROM HAVING SOCIAL CONNECTION THROUGH THINGS LIKE ZOOM AND SO ON.
YOU1000000117_S0000168	FOR OLDER KIDS, THAT CAN BE THE SAME WAY WE DO IT AS ADULTS.
YOU1000000117_S0000169	BUT EVEN FOR YOUNGER KIDS, THAT CAN BE THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU SET UP AND STRUCTURE.
YOU1000000117_S0000170	MY COLLEAGUE, JAMIL ZAKI, WHO'S A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WAS ON THE HAPPINESS LAB PODCAST,
YOU1000000117_S0000171	HE HAS REALLY YOUNGER KIDS AND HE NOTES THAT HE AND HIS FRIENDS ARE SETTING UP PLAY DATES OVER ZOOM.
YOU1000000117_S0000172	THEY'RE KIND OF GOING ONLINE AND PRINTING OUT THE SAME COLORING PAGES SO THAT KIDS CAN COLOR TOGETHER, COLOR THE SAME THING.
YOU1000000117_S0000173	ACROSS THE WAY, ACROSS ZOOM. AND THAT CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL, KIND OF GIVING THIS STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL CONNECTION BACK TO YOUR KIDS WHEN THEY NEED IT.
YOU1000000117_S0000174	BUT ANOTHER THING TO BUILD IN, I THINK, WOULD BE TO ALLOW KIDS TO SEE THAT, AGAIN, THIS ISN'T ALL DOOM AND GLOOM.
YOU1000000117_S0000175	IF YOU LOOK, LIKE THERE ARE HEROES AND REAL STORIES OF KINDNESS OUT THERE.
YOU1000000117_S0000176	AND SO ANOTHER TIP WOULD BE TO KIND OF EXPOSE YOUR KIDS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING.
YOU1000000117_S0000177	TELL THEM YOUR STORIES ABOUT COVID KINDNESS THAT YOU'RE READING ABOUT IN THE NEWS.
YOU1000000117_S0000178	TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE HEROES THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS.
YOU1000000117_S0000179	AND ALLOW THEM TO EXPERIENCE THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOOD STUFF OUT THERE AS WELL.
YOU1000000117_S0000180	I THINK THE THIRD AND FINAL TIP IS THAT YOU BEING THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON YOUR KIDS.
YOU1000000117_S0000181	IF YOU'VE LISTENED TO PAST EPISODES OF THE HAPPINESS LAB, YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT CASES OF EMOTIONAL CONTAGION.
YOU1000000117_S0000182	AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE OFTEN PART OF THESE AFFECTIVE SPIRALS.
YOU1000000117_S0000183	WHERE ONE MEMBER OF OUR TEAM OR OUR FAMILIES FEELS A CERTAIN WAY, FEELS PANICKY, AND THEN THAT PANIC CAN BE CONTAGIOUS AND IT TRANSMITS AND IT GETS WORSE.
YOU1000000117_S0000184	REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN BE THE CALM IN THE STORM FOR YOUR KIDS. YOU KNOW, IF YOU TAKE TIME TO REGULATE YOUR OWN ANXIETY, YOU KNOW, DO YOUR OWN DEEP BREATHS BEFORE YOU FACE THEM.
YOU1000000117_S0000185	IF YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS SITUATION AS A CHALLENGE, NOT A CRISIS, YOU'RE GOING TO TRANSMIT THAT CALM AND THOSE POSITIVE STATES TO THEM.
YOU1000000117_S0000186	AND THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY IS TO BE EMBODYING THOSE POSITIVE EMOTIONS YOURSELF.
YOU1000000117_S0000187	AND THAT OFTEN MEANS DOING THE RIGHT THINGS TO PROTECT YOUR OWN WELL BEING, THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.
YOU1000000117_S0000188	OKAY, SO THAT WAS ONE FROM JESSICA. NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO ONE FROM LINDSAY.
YOU1000000117_S0000189	LINDSAY ASKS, IN YOUR COURSE WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW EXPERIENCES AND NOT THINGS MAKE US HAPPY.
YOU1000000117_S0000190	IN THIS TIME OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SELF QUARANTINE, ARE THERE ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR EXPERIENCES WE COULD CREATE INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH OUR FAMILIES?
YOU1000000117_S0000191	I LOVE THIS QUESTION IN PART BECAUSE IT'S, YOU KNOW, DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT I SUGGEST, RIGHT, WHICH IS LIKE BEING PROACTIVE.
YOU1000000117_S0000192	YOU KNOW, USING THE TOPICS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE COURSE AND THE INTERVENTIONS WE'VE SEEN IN THE COURSE IN THIS SPECIAL TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000193	I THINK ONE OF THE ODD BUT GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS CURRENT TIME IS THAT WE'RE ALL IN A NEW SITUATION.
YOU1000000117_S0000194	LIKE WE'RE ALL FACED WITH BEING AT HOME IN A WAY WE HAVEN'T BEEN BEFORE. WE HAVE MORE TIME WITH OUR KIDS, MORE TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000117_S0000195	ALL THE RESEARCH IN PSYCHOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN HARNESS THESE NEW SITUATIONS TO FORM NEW DIFFERENT HABITS.
YOU1000000117_S0000196	IN OTHER WORDS, WE CAN START THINGS THAT WE HADN'T TRIED BEFORE, YOU KNOW, NEW GAME NIGHTS, NEW FAMILY DINNERS, NEW TRADITIONS.
YOU1000000117_S0000197	ALL OF THESE THINGS, BECAUSE WE'RE IN THIS MOMENT WHERE WE START A NEW SITUATION.
YOU1000000117_S0000198	ARE EASY TO HARNESS. WE CAN HARNESS WHAT ARE CALLED FRESH STARTS, WHICH IS SOME WONDERFUL RESEARCH BY KATIE MILFMAN AND OTHERS.
YOU1000000117_S0000199	SHOWS THAT THESE NEW SITUATIONS AND THESE NEW MOMENTS OF FRESH STARTS ALLOW US TO FORM HABITS BETTER.
YOU1000000117_S0000200	AND SO I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CREATIVE EXPERIENCES YOU COULD COME UP WITH WITH YOUR FAMILY.
YOU1000000117_S0000201	YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU START COOKING DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY IN A DIFFERENT WAY. MAYBE YOU START ZOOMING, YOU KNOW, GRANDMA AND GRANDPA INTO YOUR ZOOM MEETINGS.
YOU1000000117_S0000202	MAYBE YOU ALL ENGAGE IN A YOGA CLASS OR SOME CRAZY EXERCISE TOGETHER.
YOU1000000117_S0000203	MAYBE THIS IS THE TIME TO START THAT GRATITUDE, YOU KNOW, THREE GOOD THINGS THAT YOU LIST BEFORE DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY.
YOU1000000117_S0000204	ALL THESE THINGS ARE EASIER TO START. THEY'RE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE EASIER TO GET GOING.
YOU1000000117_S0000205	BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE NORMS OF WHAT OUR FAMILIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO DURING THIS TIME. IT'S SO NEW.
YOU1000000117_S0000206	AND THAT PROVIDES THIS REAL OPPORTUNITY IF YOU CAN HARNESS IT TO PUT GOOD THINGS IN PLACE FOR YOURSELF AND FOR YOUR FAMILY.
YOU1000000117_S0000207	AND SO I THINK FOR THOSE EXPERIENCES, YOU KNOW, GET REALLY CREATIVE. AND THAT CAN BE WITH YOUR KIDS, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE WITH YOUR SPOUSES.
YOU1000000117_S0000208	YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T NECESSARILY GO OUT ON THE TYPICAL BORING DINNER DATES OR GO TO THAT SAME RESTAURANT YOU WENT TO EVERY SINGLE WEEK.
YOU1000000117_S0000209	SO TRY SOMETHING NEW, WHETHER THAT'S A NEW SPOT IN THE HOUSE TO HAVE DINNER, A NEW CANDLE, PUT DOWN A TABLECLOTH, TRY A NEW MEAL.
YOU1000000117_S0000210	YOU CAN CREATE THESE NOVEL EXPERIENCES. AND IF YOU FRAME THESE THINGS AS NOVEL EXPERIENCES, THAT CAN BE POWERFUL FOR YOUR WELLBEING AS WELL.
YOU1000000117_S0000211	OKAY, SO THAT WAS LINDSAY'S QUESTION. MOVING ON, WE'RE REALLY SCROLLING THROUGH, SO I'M ENCOURAGING YOU AGAIN TO SEND IN YOUR QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T YET. WE HAVE ABOUT 10 MORE MINUTES IN THIS CHAT, SO SEND THEM IN.
YOU1000000117_S0000212	NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM CHERYL AND CHERYL ASKS, WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT SLEEP PROBLEMS? I CAN'T SLEEP, ANXIETY, UNCERTAINTY, ETC.
YOU1000000117_S0000213	CHERYL, YOU ARE REALLY SPEAKING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS GOING THROUGH THIS PRETTY BADLY ABOUT LAST WEEK.
YOU1000000117_S0000214	WHEN I WAS JUST REALIZING THAT I JUST WAS UNABLE TO KIND OF FALL ASLEEP.
YOU1000000117_S0000215	EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRYING TO GET TO BED AT A REASONABLE HOUR, MY MIND WAS LIKE,
YOU1000000117_S0000217	IT WAS REALLY, REALLY HARD.
YOU1000000117_S0000219	AND SO I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE TO PROMOTE SLEEP AND THEY'RE ALL THINGS THAT COME FROM THE RESEARCH.
YOU1000000117_S0000220	ONE OF THESE IS TO HARNESS THE POWER OF RITUAL BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.
YOU1000000117_S0000221	THERE'S LOTS OF FANTASTIC WORK BY MIKE NORTON AND FRANCESCA GINO SHOWING THE POWER OF RITUAL TO CONTROL THINGS WHEN THINGS FEEL OUT OF CONTROL.
YOU1000000117_S0000222	AND I THINK RIGHT NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PREVENTING US FROM SLEEPING IS THAT EVERYTHING FEELS REALLY OUT OF CONTROL.
YOU1000000117_S0000223	AND SO I'VE STARTED SOME SEEMINGLY DUMB PRIVATE SLEEP RITUALS. I KIND OF SET UP AT NIGHT AND KIND OF REMAKE MY BED IF MY BED WASN'T MADE BEFORE.
YOU1000000117_S0000224	I FOUND ALL THE OLD LOTIONS THAT I HAVE IN MY CABINET THAT I HAVEN'T USED IN A WHILE.
YOU1000000117_S0000225	LIKE EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED, I KIND OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, PUT SOME LOTION ON AND TRY TO BE REALLY MINDFUL ABOUT THE WAY IT SMELLS AND THE WAY IT FEELS AND KIND OF GET INTO BED. IT SOUNDS REALLY SILLY.
YOU1000000117_S0000226	BUT HARNESSING THIS RITUAL THE SCIENCE SUGGESTS CAN KIND OF MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE IN CONTROL.
YOU1000000117_S0000227	AND IT CAN ALSO TRAIN YOUR BODY THAT LIKE, OH WAIT, AFTER I DO THE RITUAL OF THE LOTION, THEN I GO TO BED.
YOU1000000117_S0000228	A SECOND THING THAT I'VE DONE, AND THIS IS PROBABLY THEN EVEN MORE POWERFUL, IS TO REALLY REGULATE HOW MUCH ANXIETY PROVOKING MATERIAL I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED.
YOU1000000117_S0000229	I KNOW I'VE TOLD LOTS OF YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS OF PHONES AND PARTICULARLY THE DANGERS OF PHONES RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.
YOU1000000117_S0000230	BUT THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE FOLLOWING THAT ADVICE.
YOU1000000117_S0000231	BASICALLY, I HAVE A RULE NOW THAT AFTER 8PM, I PUT MY PHONE AWAY. I JUST PUT IT ON SILENT.
YOU1000000117_S0000232	I PUT IT IN A SPECIFIC SPOT IN MY BEDROOM AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT ANYMORE.
YOU1000000117_S0000233	WHICH IS TRICKY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M REALLY USED TO KIND OF SCROLLING AND USING MY PHONE BEFORE I GO TO BED.
YOU1000000117_S0000234	BUT I'VE TRIED TO SUBSTITUTE THAT HABIT WITH SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW FROM OUR HABIT RESEARCH, IF YOU HAVE A CUE BUT NO ACTION TO DO, IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME A BAD HABIT FROM BEFORE.
YOU1000000117_S0000235	AND SO MY NEW HABIT WHEN I HAVE THE CUE OF LIKE, OH, I REALLY WANT TO CHECK MY PHONE BEFORE BED IS A PHYSICAL BOOK. I'VE JUST FOUND OLD BOOKS IN MY HOUSE THAT I EITHER WANT TO READ OR WERE SITTING ON THAT SHELF AND I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO YET. AND THOSE ARE THERE.
YOU1000000117_S0000236	AND SO THOSE DIFFERENT HABITS OF KIND OF BEGINNING A SORT OF SLEEP RITUAL THAT'S LIKE HEALTHIER.
YOU1000000117_S0000237	AND GETTING RID OF THE PHONE, WHICH IS BAD BECAUSE OF ITS LIGHT, BUT ALSO BECAUSE ON THE OTHER END OF THAT PHONE RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY PROVOKING CONTENT. THAT CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL FOR ME.
YOU1000000117_S0000238	AND I GUESS MAYBE THE THIRD THING IS JUST TO PRIORITIZE IT.
YOU1000000117_S0000239	I'VE BEEN TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, GIVEN THAT WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE BIT, MANY OF US HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH OUR WORK TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000240	I'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING TO MOVE ANY WORK MEETINGS THAT ARE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO A LITTLE BIT LATER.
YOU1000000117_S0000241	SO EVEN IF I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP OR I'M HAVING SOME RESTLESS SLEEP, I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO MAKE IT UP THESE DAYS.
YOU1000000117_S0000242	AND SO HIGHLY, HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRIORITIZE SLEEP. REMEMBER, SLEEP ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH, BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO PROTECT YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION.
YOU1000000117_S0000243	DURING A TIME WHEN WE ALL REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR IMMUNE FUNCTION IS AS HIGH AND AS EFFECTIVE AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE.
YOU1000000117_S0000244	OKAY, SO UP NEXT QUESTION. MARISOL IS HERE AND SHE IS ASKING,
YOU1000000117_S0000245	I HAVE A COUPLE OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID 19. I FEEL LIKE MY MIND IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THAT. SO HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I GO ABOUT MY DAY WITH CARING FOR MY FAMILY, BUT ALSO TAKING CARE OF MY OWN MENTAL HEALTH?
YOU1000000117_S0000246	I THINK THIS IS, AGAIN, I'LL START BY DOING I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE, WHICH IS TO VALIDATE THIS.
YOU1000000117_S0000247	MANY OF US ARE GOING THROUGH THE SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE FOR COVID 19 OR PRESUME POSITIVE FOR COVID 19. I THINK A DIFFERENT, SCARIER SITUATION WHERE YOU CAN'T GET TESTED.
YOU1000000117_S0000248	AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY SCARY. AND SOMETIMES THAT COMES WITH THE ADDITIONALLY AWFUL THING THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE YOURSELF OR IF YOU'RE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION YOURSELF,
YOU1000000117_S0000249	YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO HELP THEM IN THE NORMAL WAY BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME DISTANCE FROM THEM.
YOU1000000117_S0000250	AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THING TO DO WITH THIS IS TO HAVE SOME SELF COMPASSION. THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY BAD SITUATION.
YOU1000000117_S0000251	AND YOU KIND OF JUST NEED TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF AND STOP FEELING GUILTY.
YOU1000000117_S0000252	IF YOU'RE IN THE POSITION WHERE YOU WANT TO BE HELPING YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND ARE FEELING FRUSTRATED THAT YOU CAN'T INTERACT WITH THEM DIRECTLY,
YOU1000000117_S0000253	THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE FAR AWAY OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE VULNERABLE THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO.
YOU1000000117_S0000254	I THINK ONE THING THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOU CAN DO TO HELP WITH THAT IS TO ALLOW THOSE PRO SOCIAL URGES TO COME OUT ANOTHER WAY. ARE THERE OTHER ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS YOU CAN HELP?
YOU1000000117_S0000255	OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN DO THAT'S DOING GOOD IN THE WORLD, EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DO GOOD FOR THAT ONE PERSON. I THINK THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000117_S0000256	BUT IN TERMS OF JUST GOING THROUGH THAT SITUATION WITH FAMILY MEMBERS, I THINK PART OF IT IS TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE YOUR OWN SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY.
YOU1000000117_S0000257	I THINK THE STRESS OF HAVING FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE SICK ON OUR OWN BODIES CAN BE INCREDIBLY ANXIETY PROVOKING.
YOU1000000117_S0000258	AND I THINK YOU NEED TO JUST TAKE TIME TO KIND OF BREATHE. AND AGAIN, WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT BEFORE ABOUT KIND OF DOING THESE SLOWER BREATHS, THESE BELLY BREATHS WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT ON OUR PODCAST AND THINGS.
YOU1000000117_S0000259	THAT IS THE TIME TO DO THAT DEEP BREATHING.
YOU1000000117_S0000260	BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HELP YOUR OWN IMMUNE FUNCTION. IT'S GOING TO SORT OF SHUT OFF THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY.
YOU1000000117_S0000261	AND ALLOW YOU TO TURN ON THIS PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS ACTIVITY, WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW, THE SORT OF REST AND DIGEST, AND THAT WILL HELP YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION.
YOU1000000117_S0000262	BUT IT'LL ALSO GIVE YOU THE BANDWIDTH TO DEAL WITH THAT STRESSFUL SITUATION.
YOU1000000117_S0000263	REMEMBER, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT, THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU CAN DO TO EMBODY CALM YOURSELF IN ORDER TO HELP THE OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE.
YOU1000000117_S0000264	AND SO VERY, VERY HARD AND SCARY SITUATION, COMPLETELY VALIDATING THAT.
YOU1000000117_S0000265	BUT AGAIN, KNOW THAT THERE'S SIMPLE ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE TO KIND OF TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN EMOTIONS AND SORT OF WORK WITH THEM EVEN IN THIS REALLY SCARY TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000267	FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF AT TIME. OUR FINAL QUESTION COMES FROM HOLLY.
YOU1000000117_S0000268	WHO ASKS THAT HER QUESTION IS AROUND TRYING TO DO RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS AND MAKE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS DURING THIS TIME.
YOU1000000117_S0000269	SHE HAS A FEW IDEAS IN MIND, BUT IT'S HARD TO FIND WAYS IN EVERYDAY LIFE WHEN YOU'RE IN ISOLATION TO DO THIS MORE.
YOU1000000117_S0000270	I AGREE COMPLETELY. IN THE COURSE AND ON THE PODCAST, WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THESE
YOU1000000117_S0000271	KIND OF RANDOM SOCIAL CONNECTIONS, YOU KNOW, THE CHATTING WITH THE BARISTA SOCIAL CONNECTIONS THAT HAPPEN REGULARLY. THIS IS THE STUFF THAT WE'RE MISSING MORE AND MORE NOW.
YOU1000000117_S0000272	AND SO ONE OF THE TIPS I'VE BEEN GIVING IS TO TRY TO BUILD IN SOCIAL CONNECTION. THAT'S NOT THE LIKE VERY FORMAL CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE FOLKS AT WORK, BUT REALLY INFORMAL TYPE THINGS.
YOU1000000117_S0000273	YOU KNOW, LIKE I'M GONNA DO A YOGA CLASS, JUST LIKE CALL, YOU KNOW, TEXT A FEW FRIENDS AND SAY, HEY, WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN WITH ME?
YOU1000000117_S0000274	OR I'M GOING TO HAVE A HALF HOUR WHERE I'M CHOPPING VEGETABLES AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER'S IN MY PANTRY TO COOK TONIGHT.
YOU1000000117_S0000275	LET ME SEE IF I CAN ZOOM A FRIEND WHO CAN JUMP IN WITH ME THEN.
YOU1000000117_S0000276	I THINK THESE INFORMAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000117_S0000277	WE HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY BUILD THEM IN IN A WAY THAT WE DIDN'T BEFORE. THE TWO THINGS THERE, ONE IS THAT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK.
YOU1000000117_S0000278	AND THE SECOND THING IS IF YOU FORM THE RIGHT HABIT NOW, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMPORT THAT LATER.
YOU1000000117_S0000279	SO THAT WHEN THIS WHOLE CRISIS IS OVER, YOU'RE DOING THOSE THINGS AS WELL.
YOU1000000117_S0000280	IN TERMS OF THE RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS PART, I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE CAN BE DOING TO REACH OUT TO OTHERS.
YOU1000000117_S0000281	ONE IS JUST TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS ACT OF SHELTERING IN PLACE, STAYING HOME, IS A PRO SOCIAL ACTION. YOU ARE HELPING OTHER PEOPLE AND HELPING TO FLATTEN THE CURVE.
YOU1000000117_S0000282	MAYBE SAVING THE THOUSANDS OF LIVES BY YOUR SIMPLE ACTION. SO MAKE SURE YOU REFRAME IT THAT WAY.
YOU1000000117_S0000283	BUT THE OTHER THING IS TO USE WHATEVER WINDFALLS YOU HAVE, WHETHER THAT'S EXTRA TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORKING AS MUCH.
YOU1000000117_S0000284	OR A LITTLE FINANCIAL WINDFALL. YOU KNOW, THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T PAYING GAS TO COMMUTE OR BUYING THAT COFFEE AT THE COFFEE SHOP REGULARLY THAT YOU NORMALLY BUY.
YOU1000000117_S0000285	THOSE ARE LITTLE FINANCIAL WINDFALLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU1000000117_S0000286	AND SO WHAT CAN YOU USE TO USE THAT MONEY TO SAY, HELP LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO NEED SOME HELP? OR IF YOU JUST HAVE EXTRA TIME, WHAT CAN YOU DO TO KIND OF CONTACT ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MIGHT NEED A CONNECTION RIGHT NOW?
YOU1000000117_S0000287	OR EVEN TALK TO YOUR CONGRESSPEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. LIKE THESE ARE THE TIMES WHEN WE CAN USE OUR TEMPORAL WINDFALLS, OUR TIME WINDFALLS, TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE A LOT.
YOU1000000117_S0000288	OKAY, I THINK THAT WAS A LOT. I HOPE THAT YOU HEARD SOME FANTASTIC SUGGESTIONS.
YOU1000000117_S0000289	I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN MIND THE MAIN THING THAT I KEEP MENTIONING, WHICH IS SELF COMPASSION.
YOU1000000117_S0000290	THIS IS A REALLY CHALLENGING TIME AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF.
YOU1000000117_S0000291	BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF IS TO REMEMBER WHAT SCIENCE SUGGESTS ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN IMPROVE YOUR WELL BEING.
YOU1000000117_S0000292	WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE WASHING YOUR HANDS AND DOING GOOD STUFF FOR YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH. I HOPE THIS HAS GIVEN YOU A BUNCH OF TIPS FOR WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH TOO.
YOU1000000117_S0000293	THERE'S SO MANY COMMENTS ON THERE SENDING GRATITUDE MY WAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU ARE VERY WELCOME.
YOU1000000117_S0000294	I HOPE THIS HAS GIVEN YOU SOME USEFUL TIPS AND I THANK YOU FOR SIGNING ON. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
YOU1000000118_S0000001	WE START THE SPECIALIZATION WITH THIS COURSE.
YOU1000000118_S0000002	HOW GOOGLE DOES ML, WHERE I INTRODUCE MACHINE LEARNING, AND WHAT GOOGLE MEANS WHEN WE SAY WE ARE AI FIRST.
YOU1000000118_S0000003	MY COLLEAGUE JOSH THEN COMES IN TO TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF MACHINE LEARNING.
YOU1000000118_S0000004	WE END WITH A DISCUSSION OF TOOLING OF HOW TO DO MACHINE LEARNING AT SCALE USING PYTHON NOTEBOOKS AND SERVERLESS DATA PROCESSING COMPONENTS.
YOU1000000118_S0000006	NOW, IF YOU'RE AN ENGINEER OR A SCIENTIST, YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING THAT THIS IS ALL TOO HIGH LEVEL.
YOU1000000118_S0000007	AND YOU'RE READY TO JUMP TO THE NEXT COURSE, WHICH STARTS TO DELVE INTO TECHNICAL DETAILS OF TENSORFLOW. BUT BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU1000000118_S0000008	WHEN WE TAUGHT THIS SET OF COURSES TO OUR CUSTOMERS,
YOU1000000118_S0000009	ONE REMARK THAT OFTEN CAME BACK WAS THAT THE MODULE BY JOSH WAS THE ONE THEY REVISITED THE MOST OFTEN.
YOU1000000118_S0000011	AFTER THEY WENT BACK TO WORK, SIX MONTHS LATER, THE MODULE THAT THEY WENT TO LOOK AT THE MOST WAS ON THE STRATEGY OF MACHINE LEARNING.
YOU1000000118_S0000012	SO YOU WANT TO GET THE BIG PICTURE BEFORE YOU DELVE INTO THE TECHNICAL DETAILS.
YOU1000000118_S0000013	BECAUSE THE BIG PICTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET BUY IN FROM THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION TO CARRY OUT.
YOU1000000118_S0000014	WE THEN MOVE ON TO DOING MACHINE LEARNING WITH TENSORFLOW. THAT INVOLVES TWO ASPECTS.
YOU1000000118_S0000015	ONE, CREATING A GOOD MACHINE LEARNING DATASET, AND TWO, BUILDING YOUR FIRST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL WITH TENSORFLOW.
YOU1000000118_S0000016	CREATING A MACHINE LEARNING DATA SET IS ANOTHER OF THOSE PRACTICAL MODULES THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO IGNORE.
YOU1000000118_S0000017	WHEN YOU CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND IT WORKS WELL IN YOUR EXPERIMENTS, BUT THEN FAILS MISERABLY IN PRODUCTION,
YOU1000000118_S0000018	THE REASON WILL OFTEN COME BACK TO HOW YOU CREATED THE MACHINE LEARNING DATASET. SO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO ABSORB THE LESSONS.
YOU1000000118_S0000019	AND THEN WE HAVE TWO COURSES THAT ARE ABOUT IMPROVING MACHINE LEARNING ACCURACY.
YOU1000000118_S0000020	AS YOU BUILD YOUR FIRST MACHINE LEARNING MODEL, YOU WILL LEARN THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE THAT MODEL.
YOU1000000118_S0000021	SO THINK OF THIS SECTION AS FILLING YOUR TOOL CHEST WITH A SET OF IDEAS.
YOU1000000118_S0000022	YOU'LL USE DIFFERENT IDEAS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. SO YOU'LL FIND THAT KNOWING THEM WILL BE HELPFUL IN YOUR CAREER AS YOU SOLVE DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS.
YOU1000000118_S0000023	AND AS BEFORE, IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST NAME CHECK THESE CONCEPTS. YOU NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO UNDERSTAND THEM.
YOU1000000118_S0000024	AND KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN CODE. WE THEN MOVE ON TO A SET OF COURSES THAT ARE ABOUT OPERATIONALIZING THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL.
YOU1000000118_S0000025	AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, OPERATIONALIZING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL.
YOU1000000118_S0000026	AND BY THAT I MEAN TRAINING IT AT SCALE IN A DISTRIBUTED WAY, SERVING OUT THE PREDICTIONS.
YOU1000000118_S0000027	BUILDING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL END TO END, OPERATIONALIZING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL CAN BE SUPER HARD.
YOU1000000118_S0000028	IT IS A STAGE WHERE MOST ENTERPRISE MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS FAIL.
YOU1000000118_S0000029	I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY COMPANIES I'VE TALKED TO WHO HAVE SAID THEIR INNOVATION TEAMS HAD DEVISED THESE COOL ML PROJECTS, BUT THEY WERE STRUGGLING GETTING THE ML MODELS INTO PRODUCTION.
YOU1000000118_S0000030	IN THIS SET OF COURSES, WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO TRAIN, DEPLOY, AND PREDICT WITH ML MODELS IN A WAY THAT THEY'RE PRODUCTION READY.
YOU1000000118_S0000031	AND FINALLY, WE DELVE BACK INTO MACHINE LEARNING THEORY, BUT THEORY IN BIG AIR QUOTES.
YOU1000000118_S0000032	MACHINE LEARNING THEORY IS MOSTLY HEURISTICS. MACHINE LEARNING IS AN INTENSELY HEURISTIC DISCIPLINE.
YOU1000000118_S0000033	AND YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR BAG OF TOOLS AND TRICKS.
YOU1000000118_S0000034	SO WE'LL INTRODUCE A NUMBER OF TOOLS AND TRICKS THAT WORK WHEN THE INPUTS TO YOUR MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ARE IMAGES.
YOU1000000118_S0000036	TOOLS AND TRICKS THAT HELP IN YOUR PROCESSING OR OUTPUTTING SEQUENCES.
YOU1000000118_S0000037	AND SEQUENCES IN MACHINE LEARNING CAN BE EITHER TIME SERIES DATA OR TEXT DATA.
YOU1000000118_S0000038	AND FINALLY, WE WILL LOOK AT SEVERAL WAYS TO BUILD POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS.
YOU1000000118_S0000039	RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS ARE HOW YOU BUILD PERSONALIZED ALGORITHMS.
YOU1000000118_S0000040	AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT MOST ML ENGINEERS BUILD AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREERS.
YOU1000000118_S0000041	IN FACT, IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY ML SYSTEM THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL BUILD.
YOU1000000118_S0000042	BUT IN ORDER TO BUILD POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION ENGINES, IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND TOOLS AND TRICKS.
YOU1000000118_S0000043	THAT ARE BORROWED FROM IMAGES AND FROM SEQUENCES.
YOU1000000118_S0000044	SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT THEM IN THIS ORDER. AND THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT RECOMMENDATION ENGINES PRETTY MUCH AT THE END OF THE SPECIALIZATION.
YOU1000000118_S0000045	NOW, YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME OF THIS MATERIAL BEFORE, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST FOUR COURSES.
YOU1000000118_S0000046	FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE COURSES ON CREATING MACHINE LEARNING DATASETS,
YOU1000000118_S0000047	AND ON TENSORFLOW BASICS. SOME OF THE SLIDES WILL BE A REPEAT OF SERVERLESS MACHINE LEARNING WITH TENSORFLOW THAT'S AVAILABLE IN COURSERA.
YOU1000000118_S0000048	SIMILARLY, IF YOU ENCOUNTERED GOOGLE'S MACHINE LEARNING CRASH COURSE. THIS IS AN INTERNAL GOOGLE COURSE, BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN TAUGHT ON SOME UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES.
YOU1000000118_S0000049	YOU MIGHT FIND SOME OF THE MATERIAL AND FEATURE REPRESENTATION AND ART AND SCIENCE OF ML TO BE FAMILIAR.
YOU1000000118_S0000051	IN SPITE OF THIS THOUGH, THE DETAILS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. SO DON'T SKIP IT COMPLETELY.
YOU1000000118_S0000052	TREAT THESE COURSES AS A USEFUL REFRESHER AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU STILL REMEMBER THE IDEAS PRESENTED IN THOSE SECTIONS.
YOU1000000119_S0000001	WELCOME TO THE FIRST COURSE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN SPECIALIZATION TITLED BLOCKCHAIN BASICS.
YOU1000000119_S0000002	LET'S START BY ASKING OURSELVES, WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN? WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT IT?
YOU1000000119_S0000003	UNLIKE TRADITIONAL METHODS, BLOCKCHAIN ENABLES PEER TO PEER TRANSFER OF DIGITAL ASSETS WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIARIES.
YOU1000000119_S0000004	IT WAS A TECHNOLOGY ORIGINALLY CREATED TO SUPPORT THE FAMOUS CRYPTOCURRENCY BITCOIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000005	THE BLOCKCHAIN BY ITSELF HAS TAKEN A LIFE OF ITS OWN AND PERMEATED A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS ACROSS MANY INDUSTRIES INCLUDING FINANCE, HEALTHCARE, GOVERNMENT, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION.
YOU1000000119_S0000006	THE BLOCKCHAIN IS POISED TO INNOVATE AND TRANSFORM A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING GOODS TRANSFER, FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPLY CHAIN, DIGITAL MEDIA TRANSFER, FOR EXAMPLE, SALE OF ART.
YOU1000000119_S0000007	REMOTE SERVICES DELIVERY, EXAMPLE, TRAVEL AND TOURISM, PLATFORM FOR DECENTRALIZED BUSINESS LOGIC, FOR EXAMPLE, MOVING COMPUTING TO DATA SOURCES.
YOU1000000119_S0000008	AND DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLE, EDUCATION AND CREDENTIALING.
YOU1000000119_S0000009	ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN INCLUDE DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES, FOR EXAMPLE, POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION.
YOU1000000119_S0000010	CROWDFUNDING FOR EXAMPLE STARTUP FUNDRAISING, CROWD OPERATION FOR EXAMPLE ELECTRONIC VOTING, IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FOR EXAMPLE, ONE ID FOR ALL YOUR LIFE'S FUNCTIONS.
YOU1000000119_S0000011	AND GOVERNMENT PUBLIC RECORDS AND OPEN GOVERNING.
YOU1000000119_S0000013	MOREOVER, BLOCKCHAIN CAN ENABLE AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. IT CAN ENABLE A PERSON IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE WORLD TO PARTAKE IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
YOU1000000119_S0000014	OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS ARE ENDLESS.
YOU1000000119_S0000015	THERE IS A DIRE NEED FOR CRITICAL THINKERS, DESIGNERS, AND DEVELOPERS WHO CAN ENVISION AND CREATE NEWER APPLICATION MODELS ON BLOCKCHAIN TO BENEFIT THE WORLD.
YOU1000000119_S0000016	THIS COURSE IS A FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS NEED.
YOU1000000119_S0000017	AT THE END OF THIS COURSE, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE THE BLOCKCHAIN USING BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000018	BITCOIN IS NOT THE ONLY PLAYER IN TOWN. BY THE END OF THE FIRST MODULE, WE'LL MOVE BEYOND BITCOIN INTO INTRODUCING THE NEXT GENERATION BLOCKCHAINS WITH ETHEREUM.
YOU1000000119_S0000020	YOU WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN THAT IS USED AS A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION IN MANY NEWER BLOCKCHAINS.
YOU1000000119_S0000021	AND EXPLAIN THE ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES THAT ENABLE THE BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING A PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY AND HASHING.
YOU1000000119_S0000022	FINALLY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO OUTLINE METHODS FOR REALIZING TRUST IN A BLOCKCHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000024	LET'S BEGIN WITH AN INTRODUCTION OF BITCOIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000025	TWO MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF CRYPTOCURRENCY BITCOIN ARE A CONTINUOUSLY WORKING DIGITAL CURRENCY SYSTEM AND A MODEL FOR AUTONOMOUS DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY CALLED THE BLOCKCHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000027	THOUGH OUR FOCUS IS ON A GENERAL BLOCKCHAIN, WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORKING OF THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND BITCOIN TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE INNOVATION OF BLOCKCHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000029	WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB HAS TRANSFORMED EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES FROM STOCK MARKETS TO STREET CORNER FOOD TRUCKS.
YOU1000000119_S0000030	IT HAS ENABLED THE TECHNOLOGY EXPLOSION WITH WEB 2.0 AND THE WORLD OF E COMMERCE APPLICATIONS.
YOU1000000119_S0000031	AROUND 2008, 2009, WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS WE TRUSTED WERE CRUMBLING DOWN AND EVERYBODY WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE WALL STREET.
YOU1000000119_S0000032	A MYSTERIOUS PERSON OR PERSONS CALLED SATOSHI NAKAMOTO INTRODUCED A NEW DIGITAL CURRENCY, A CRYPTOCURRENCY CALLED BITCOIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000034	BITCOIN ENABLED AN INNOVATIVE PLATFORM FOR PEER TO PEER TRANSFER OF VALUE WITHOUT ANY CENTRAL AUTHORITY.
YOU1000000119_S0000036	WITH NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY, HOW DID BITCOIN REALIZE TRUST AND SECURITY?
YOU1000000119_S0000037	BY IMPLEMENTING SOFTWARE PROGRAMS FOR VALIDATION, VERIFICATION, CONSENSUS IN A NOVEL INFRASTRUCTURE CALLED THE BLOCKCHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000039	LATER ON, IN ABOUT 2012 2013, COMPUTATIONAL ELEMENTS WERE ADDED TO THE BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE
YOU1000000119_S0000040	THAT HAS OPENED UP A WHOLE WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES BEYOND SIMPLE CURRENCY TRANSFER.
YOU1000000119_S0000041	THESE INNOVATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SHAPING THE DIRECTION OF WEB 3.0 AS YOU WILL LEARN IN THE NEXT FOUR COURSES.
YOU1000000119_S0000043	WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN? BLOCKCHAIN IS ABOUT ENABLING PEER TO PEER TRANSACTION IN A DECENTRALIZED NETWORK.
YOU1000000119_S0000044	ESTABLISHING TRUST AMONG UNKNOWN PEERS.
YOU1000000119_S0000045	RECORDING THE TRANSACTION IN AN IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED LEDGER.
YOU1000000119_S0000047	LET'S UNDERSTAND CENTRALIZED VERSUS DECENTRALIZED NETWORK USING A COMMON SCENARIO.
YOU1000000119_S0000048	CONSIDER A SCENARIO WHERE A CUSTOMER WANTS TO BUY AN ITEM USING HER CREDIT CARD.
YOU1000000119_S0000050	LET'S ENUMERATE THE INTERMEDIARIES INVOLVED IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS TASK.
YOU1000000119_S0000051	WE HAVE A CREDIT CARD AGENCY, WE HAVE A CUSTOMER BANK, WE HAVE A CREDIT CARDS BANK, WE HAVE AN EXCHANGE, WE HAVE THE MERCHANTS BANK AND FINALLY THE MERCHANT.
YOU1000000119_S0000053	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM THAT WE ARE SO USED TO.
YOU1000000119_S0000054	NOW, COMPARE THIS WITH A SYSTEM WHERE PEERS CAN TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED.
YOU1000000119_S0000056	FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERMEDIARIES ARE SHIFTED TO THE PERIPHERY, TO THE PEER PARTICIPANT IN THE BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE.
YOU1000000119_S0000057	PEERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY KNOWN TO EACH OTHER. THIS IS A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM.
YOU1000000119_S0000058	HOW DO WE ESTABLISH TRUST AMONG THE PEERS IN SUCH A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM?
YOU1000000119_S0000059	BY HAVING A PROCESS IN PLACE TO VALIDATE, VERIFY, AND CONFIRM TRANSACTIONS.
YOU1000000119_S0000060	RECORD THE TRANSACTION IN A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER OF BLOCKS.
YOU1000000119_S0000061	CREATE A TAMPER PROOF RECORD OF BLOCKS, CHAIN OF BLOCKS.
YOU1000000119_S0000063	AND IMPLEMENT A CONSENSUS PROTOCOL FOR AGREEMENT ON THE BLOCK TO BE ADDED TO THE CHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000064	SO, VALIDATION, VERIFICATION, CONSENSUS AND IMMUTABLE RECORDING LEAD TO THE TRUST AND SECURITY OF THE BLOCKCHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000066	NOW I'LL EXPLAIN THESE CONCEPTS USING ANOTHER SCENARIO.
YOU1000000119_S0000068	I'M LENDING AMY $10,000. THIS IS ONE SINGLE PEER TO PEER TRANSACTION.
YOU1000000119_S0000069	WE BOTH MAKE A NOTE OF IT ON A LEDGER.
YOU1000000119_S0000070	WHAT IF I CHANGE MY ENTRY FROM 10,000 TO 11,000?
YOU1000000119_S0000071	ALTERNATIVELY, AMY CHANGES HERS FROM 10,000 TO 1,000.
YOU1000000119_S0000072	TO PREVENT THIS TRUST VIOLATION, WE NEED TO SEEK THE HELP OF PEOPLE AROUND US, LISA, ALLISON AND FRANCIS.
YOU1000000119_S0000073	PROVIDE ALL OF THEM A VALID COPY OF THIS LECTURE.
YOU1000000119_S0000074	THIS IS THE BASIC CONCEPT OF AN IMMUTABLE DISTRIBUTED LEDGER DEFINED IN A BLOCKCHAIN PROCESS.
YOU1000000119_S0000076	IN THIS SCENARIO, WE WERE ALL PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN ONE LOCATION, AMHERST.
YOU1000000119_S0000077	NOW, IMAGINE THIS TO BE AN ONLINE TRANSACTION.
YOU1000000119_S0000078	TO AN UNKNOWN PEER, ALSO SCALE UP THE ONE TRANSACTION TO 10,000 TRANSACTIONS. HOW ABOUT A MILLION TRANSACTIONS?
YOU1000000119_S0000079	I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRANSACT WITH EQUAL EASE TO ANY UNKNOWN PEER IN AMHERST, ALBANY, OR ALBANIA.
YOU1000000119_S0000080	MAYBE TO SEND SOME FLOWERS TO A FRIEND IN ALBANIA. THIS IS THE TENET OF A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM SUPPORTED BY BLOCKCHAIN.
YOU1000000119_S0000082	IN THE CASE JUST DESCRIBED, HOW DO WE TRUST OUR UNKNOWN PEERS?
YOU1000000119_S0000083	THROUGH VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION. IN OUR EXAMPLE, AMY REQUESTS KEVIN TO VERIFY THE AMOUNT I TRANSACTED WITH HER.
YOU1000000119_S0000085	KEVIN CHECKS IT, OOPS, KEVIN FINDS THE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTION IS NOT 10,000 BUT 300, NOT VALID.
YOU1000000119_S0000086	KEVIN REJECTS AND NULLIFIES THE TRANSACTION. SIMILAR TO THIS, VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION METHODS DEFINED BY THE BLOCKCHAIN
YOU1000000119_S0000087	AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE PEERS PROVIDE THE COLLECTIVE TRUST NEEDED IN A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM.
YOU1000000119_S0000088	SUMMARIZING, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS METHODS FOR A DECENTRALIZED PEER TO PEER SYSTEM, A COLLECTIVE TRUST MODEL,
YOU1000000119_S0000089	AND THE DISTRIBUTED IMMUTABLE LEDGER OF RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS.
YOU1000000120_S0000001	I'M BACK.
YOU1000000120_S0000003	HOW'S IT GOING GUYS? TO EVERYONE AT KINGS LANGLEY SCHOOL, I HOPE YOU'RE ALL WELL.
YOU1000000120_S0000005	I CAME TO KINGS LANGLEY SCHOOL WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER. MY NAME'S ANTHONY JOSHUA. I KNOW HOW TOUGH IT IS FOR YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW AT HOME. I KNOW YOU'RE DOING ALL YOUR LESSONS LIVE.
YOU1000000120_S0000006	I COMMEND YOU, I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY BUT YOUR COMMITMENT WILL PAY OFF. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOURSELF ACTIVE, KEEP THE MIND ACTIVE AND KEEP THE BODY ACTIVE. MR FISHER'S ACTUALLY EMPLOYED ME.
YOU1000000120_S0000007	SO I'VE COME DOWN HERE, ESPECIALLY THIS MORNING, TO PUT IN MY TIME AND GIVE YOU A WORKOUT PLAN. I WAS ACTUALLY TAUGHT BY MR. ANNETTE. I KNOW HE'S GOT A HIIT CLASS FOR YOU GUYS.
YOU1000000120_S0000008	SO MR. ANNETTE, MAKE SURE YOU WARM UP, YOU COOL DOWN, BECAUSE YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE SORE TOMORROW.
YOU1000000120_S0000009	BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW PRIVILEGED YOU GUYS ARE TO HAVE TEACHERS WHO CARE AND LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU. IT'S NOT ONLY JUST FOR YOU.
YOU1000000120_S0000010	YOUR BROTHERS, YOUR SISTERS, YOUR AUNTIES, YOUR UNCLES, MUMS AND DADS. THIS IS FOR EVERYONE TO GET INVOLVED AND KEEP ACTIVE.
YOU1000000120_S0000011	I MAY NOT BE THE JOE WICKS OF THE INDUSTRY. I ACTUALLY TIED HIM UP AND HE'S IN THE CORNER. I'M JUST JOKING, I'M JUST JOKING.
YOU1000000120_S0000012	THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I'VE COME UP WITH, SOMETHING SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WE'RE GOING TO PROGRESS AS THE WEEKS GO ON. SO BEFORE YOU PICK UP YOUR PLAYSTATION OR XBOX CONTROLLER,
YOU1000000120_S0000013	BEFORE YOU PICK UP YOUR PHONE AND GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA, LET'S GET TO WORK. BEFORE WE START, I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU CAN DO THIS BODYWEIGHT IF YOU WANT, BUT FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME...
YOU1000000120_S0000015	I PREFER TO USE SOME EQUIPMENT AROUND THE HOUSE. SO WHAT I HAVE HERE
YOU1000000120_S0000017	IS ACTUALLY A KING LANGLEY SCHOOL BUS.
YOU1000000120_S0000019	PRIDE AND HONOR. SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS, I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP
YOU1000000120_S0000020	AND I'M GOING TO FILL IT UP WITH SOME STUFF THAT I'VE GOT AROUND THE HOUSE. SO FOR ME,
YOU1000000120_S0000022	AS I LOVE BOXING, I'VE GOT MY BOXING GLOVES HERE, SO I'M GONNA SHOVE THEM IN THE BAG. I'VE GOT SOME TOWELS. DON'T TELL MUM OR DAD, BUT WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE CUPBOARD AND GET SOME.
YOU1000000120_S0000023	COCONUT MILK, SOME PEELED TOMATOES. I'M GONNA ZIP THIS UP NOW.
YOU1000000120_S0000024	AS HEAVY AS YOU WANT, YOU DICTATE AND WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS AS EQUIPMENT THAT WE CAN USE TO ADD WEIGHT TO OUR WORKOUT. WE'RE GOING TO AIM TO DO AS MANY ROUNDS AS YOU CAN.
YOU1000000120_S0000025	WITHIN 10 MINUTES. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER YOUR SCORES SO YOU CAN COME BACK TO IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND TRY AND IMPROVE. SO GET READY TO SCREENSHOT THE WORKOUT
YOU1000000120_S0000026	SO YOU CAN TRY THIS AT HOME.
YOU1000000120_S0000028	THIS EXERCISE IS WHAT WE CALL A FRONT SQUAT. I WANT YOU TO KEEP YOUR BACK STRAIGHT, YOUR SHOULDERS ENGAGED, AND I WANT YOU TO DO THE MOVEMENT NICE AND CONTROLLED.
YOU1000000120_S0000029	AND GO DOWN AS FAR AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.
YOU1000000120_S0000031	THAT EXERCISE IS ENGAGING YOUR LEGS, YOUR QUADS, YOUR HAMSTRINGS, YOUR GLUTES, YOUR CALVES, AND ALSO IT'S ENGAGING YOUR SHOULDERS. SO IT IS A GOOD FULL BODY WORKOUT.
YOU1000000120_S0000032	SO IN THIS EXERCISE I WANT YOU TO PUT THE BACKPACK ON YOUR BACK AS IF YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A PRESS UP. BACKPACK ON MY BACK, GLUTES ARE ENGAGED, CORE ENGAGED.
YOU1000000120_S0000033	SHOULDERS TIGHT AND PUSH.
YOU1000000120_S0000035	SO JUST LIKE THE SQUAT, IT ENGAGES THE FULL BODY, IT'S GOING TO ENGAGE YOUR TRICEPS, IT'S GOING TO ENGAGE YOUR SHOULDERS, YOUR CHEST, IT'S A PUSHING MOVEMENT.
YOU1000000120_S0000036	BUT ALSO WHILE YOU'RE PUSHING IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR CORE ENGAGED AS WELL SO YOU'VE GOT A STRONG BASE AND ALSO ACTIVATE YOUR GLUTES AS WELL IF YOU CAN.
YOU1000000120_S0000038	SO THIS EXERCISE IS CALLED REVERSE LUNGE WITH AN OVERHEAD PRESS. SO HERE WE HAVE MY EQUIPMENT HERE. SO I'VE TAKEN A BAG IN MY LEFT HAND, YOU CAN USE YOUR RIGHT HAND.
YOU1000000120_S0000039	IT'S UP TO YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, BUT ALSO MAKE SURE YOU USE THE SAME SIDE LEG TO REVERSE LUNGE. SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE HERE. SO WE STAND STRAIGHT, GOOD POSTURE.
YOU1000000120_S0000040	AND I LUNGE BACK HERE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE MY KNEES NOT TOUCHING THE GROUND I WANT TO TRY AND CREATE STABILITY SO I'M ENGAGING MY CORE, MY GLUTES, MY QUADS
YOU1000000120_S0000041	AND I'M GONNA PRESS UP. THIS IS CAUSING GREAT INSTABILITY. I'M STILL ENGAGED. AS I COME DOWN, I STAND UP AND THAT'S ONE.
YOU1000000120_S0000043	MAKE SURE YOU DO BOTH SIDES.
YOU1000000120_S0000045	SO IN THIS EXERCISE, THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A ROWBOAT INTO A TWIST. SO A ROWBOAT IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ROWING A BOAT. SO YOU'RE DOWN, YOU'RE UP, YOU'RE DOWN, YOU'RE UP.
YOU1000000120_S0000046	YOU'RE DOWN, YOU'RE UP. BUT WE'RE ADDING A TWIST INTO THIS. SO I WANT YOU TO ACT AS IF YOU'RE DOING A REVERSE PLANK.
YOU1000000120_S0000048	MAKE SURE YOUR LOWER BACK'S ENGAGED, IT'S STUCK TO THE FLOOR.
YOU1000000120_S0000050	YOU'RE ENGAGING YOUR GLUTES, YOUR CORE, AND YOU ROW THE BOAT AND USE YOUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, YOUR BAG WITH EVERYTHING IN IT, AND YOU BRING IT OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. THEN YOU GO DOWN.
YOU1000000120_S0000051	HOLD, BACK UP, GRAB YOUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND BRING IT TO THE OTHER SIDE. NOT AN EASY EXERCISE
YOU1000000120_S0000053	SO YOU DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO.
YOU1000000120_S0000055	TAKE OUT SOME OF THESE TOMATOES.
YOU1000000120_S0000057	TAKE OUR PAIR OF BOXING GLOVES. MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU. YOU CAN ADJUST THE WEIGHT. THE CHOICE IS YOURS.
YOU1000000120_S0000062	AND I'M GOING TO USE MY LEFT HAND TO DRAG THIS BAG FROM MY RIGHT SIDE OVER TO MY LEFT
YOU1000000120_S0000063	ONCE I'VE GOT IT OVER, I'M GOING TO PUT THIS HAND BACK DOWN AND I'M GOING TO USE MY RIGHT HAND TO DRAG THE BAG FROM MY LEFT SIDE OVER.
YOU1000000120_S0000065	SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE I'M USING MY HAND TO DRAW AN X. SO FROM ONE CORNER TO ANOTHER, OVER, FROM ONE CORNER TO ANOTHER, AND BACK OVER.
YOU1000000120_S0000067	IT'S GREAT FOR ENGAGEMENT IN THE CORE, IT'S GREAT TO BRING YOUR WEIGHT DOWN, YOUR HEART RATE UP, GOOD FOR LOWER BACK PAINS AS WELL. ALL THESE EXERCISES CAN REALLY HELP.
YOU1000000120_S0000068	STIMULATE MUSCLES THAT YOU'RE NOT USING BUT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR STABILITY IN YOUR LIFE, IN YOUR BODY. WHETHER YOU DO THIS IN THE MORNING, WHETHER YOU DO IT IN THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING, TRY AND FIT THIS WORKOUT SOMEWHERE IN IN THE DAY.
YOU1000000120_S0000069	I HAD FUN DOING THAT. I HOPE YOU GUYS HAVE AS WELL. I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING REWARDED. I HOPE YOU CAN TRACK YOUR PROGRESSION AS WELL SO YOU CAN NOTE YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS DOWN. I CAN'T WAIT TO CATCH UP WITH MR. FISHER.
YOU1000000120_S0000070	AND GET TO KNOW WHO'S BEEN ACHIEVING AND HOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GETTING ON AND LET US KNOW YOUR FEEDBACK AS WELL SO WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
YOU1000000120_S0000071	SO, IT'S TIME TO EMPTY YOUR SCHOOL BAGS, TAKE YOUR GYM EQUIPMENT OUT, PUT YOUR SCHOOL BOOKS BACK IN, SAY HELLO TO ALL THE TEACHERS AS WELL, MAKE SURE YOU FOCUS ON YOUR MATHS AND YOUR ENGLISH EVEN IF YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT TIRED, THE DAY'S NEARLY DONE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS AND I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
YOU1000000121_S0000001	FROM THE SIDE, I'M STEPPING BACK ON MY RIGHT LEG FOR A DOUBLE BOUNCE. ONE, TWO AND THEN LEFT.
YOU1000000121_S0000002	1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.
YOU1000000121_S0000003	SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS JUST SWITCHING THE FEET AND FROM THE BACK STARTING ON THE RIGHT LEG FOR DOUBLE BOUNCE.
YOU1000000121_S0000005	1, 2, TRANSFER 1, 2, 1, 2,
YOU1000000121_S0000006	1, 2. FROM THE SIDE, BACK ON THE RIGHT.
YOU1000000121_S0000008	ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO.
YOU1000000121_S0000009	SO JUST BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS POSITION HERE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR WEIGHT ON THAT FRONT FOOT BECAUSE WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THE STEP LOOKS LIKE SALSA.
YOU1000000121_S0000010	SO WE WANT TO BRING THE WEIGHT BACK, SINK DOWN INTO THAT BACK LEG.
YOU1000000121_S0000011	SO WHEN I TAKE MY RIGHT LEG BACK, MY WEIGHT COMES INTO MY RIGHT HIP. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIFT UP THAT FRONT FOOT
YOU1000000121_S0000012	BECAUSE ALL OF MY WEIGHT IS IN THE BACK LEG. SO WITH SAMBA, YOU ALWAYS WANT TO IMAGINE LIKE YOU'RE DOING A SQUAT OR YOU'RE SITTING DOWN ON A CHAIR.
YOU1000000121_S0000013	SHOULDERS ARE BACK AND WEIGHT IS ALWAYS BACKWARDS. SO IF WE START WITH OUR RIGHT LEG BACK FOR OUR DOUBLE BOUNCE.
YOU1000000121_S0000014	WE DON'T WANT TO BRING THE WEIGHT FORWARD. SO BACK
YOU1000000121_S0000016	AND BACK
YOU1000000121_S0000018	BACK.
YOU1000000121_S0000020	AND BACK.
YOU1000000121_S0000022	SO FROM THE FRONT, LET'S PICK UP THE PACE A LITTLE MORE. AND ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO,
YOU1000000121_S0000023	SEE HOW I'M SWITCHING THE FEET, WEIGHT'S ALWAYS BACK, SWITCH
YOU1000000121_S0000025	SWITCH, SWITCH, SWITCH. LET'S TRY FROM THE SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE MY FEET.
YOU1000000121_S0000027	AND SWITCH, SWITCH, DOUBLE BOUNCE.
YOU1000000121_S0000029	ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO. FROM THE BACK, RIGHT LEG BACK.
YOU1000000121_S0000031	ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO.
YOU1000000121_S0000032	AND TO THE SIDE, RIGHT LEG BACK.
YOU1000000121_S0000033	1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2. OKAY, SO THAT'S OUR BASIC STEP.
YOU1000000121_S0000034	NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD ARMS TO THIS STEP. SO WHEN I STEP BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG, I'M GOING TO BEND MY RIGHT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000035	SO FROM THE BACK, STEPPING BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG, BENDING THE RIGHT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000036	WHEN I STEP BACK ON THE LEFT LEG, I BEND MY LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000037	RIGHT LEG, RIGHT ARM, LEFT LEG, LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000038	SO LET'S TRY THIS FROM THE FRONT, BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG, BENDING THE RIGHT ARM, BACK ON THE LEFT LEG, BENDING THE LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000039	RIGHT LEG, RIGHT ARM. LEFT LEG, LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000040	OKAY, SO REMEMBER THAT LITTLE TIP, STEP BACK ON THE RIGHT LEG, WE'RE BENDING THE RIGHT ARM, BACK ON THE LEFT LEG, BENDING THE LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000041	SO NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD OUR DOUBLE BOUNCE TO THAT.
YOU1000000121_S0000043	SO LET'S START JUST WITH FOUR DOUBLE BOUNCES TO GET INTO THE RHYTHM.
YOU1000000121_S0000045	AND TWO
YOU1000000121_S0000047	AND THREE
YOU1000000121_S0000049	AND FOUR, ADDING ARMS.
YOU1000000121_S0000051	RIGHT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000053	LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000055	RIGHT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000057	LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000059	FROM THE FRONT BACK ON THE RIGHT. SO FOUR BASIC DOUBLE BOUNCES.
YOU1000000121_S0000060	THINK ABOUT YOUR POSTURE HERE, SHOULDERS BACK, TUMMY IN, KEEP BENDING THE KNEES.
YOU1000000121_S0000061	LET'S ADD ARMS. RIGHT LEG, RIGHT ARM. LEFT LEG, LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000063	GOOD. FOUR.
YOU1000000121_S0000065	THREE.
YOU1000000121_S0000067	TWO.
YOU1000000121_S0000069	AND ONE.
YOU1000000121_S0000071	DOUBLE BOUNCE, A LITTLE FASTER, LET'S GO. AND ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO,
YOU1000000121_S0000072	ANOTHER FOUR AND THEN WE'LL ADD ARMS. THREE, TWO, RELAX THE ARMS AND RIGHT ARM, LEFT ARM.
YOU1000000121_S0000073	RIGHT AND LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT AND LEFT.
YOU1000000121_S0000074	SO FROM THE FRONT, 8 DOUBLE BOUNCES, STARTING BACK ON THE RIGHT.
YOU1000000121_S0000076	GO AND ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN.
YOU1000000121_S0000078	THREE, FOUR.
YOU1000000121_S0000080	FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, GET READY FOR ARMS, RIGHT LEG, RIGHT ARM, RIGHT ARM, LEFT ARM,
YOU1000000121_S0000081	RIGHT ARM, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, AND LEFT.
YOU1000000122_S0000001	TAKE A LOOK AT THESE TWO PHOTOS OF OUTER SPACE. WHAT DO YOU SEE? THEY'RE BASICALLY IDENTICAL, BUT NOT QUITE. NOW LOOK A DIFFERENT WAY, IN SEQUENCE.
YOU1000000122_S0000002	HERE, YOU SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SOMETHING MOVING. THAT DOT IS A NEWLY DISCOVERED WORLD. IT'S CLOSER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.
YOU1000000122_S0000003	AND THE TRICK WE USED TO FIND IT COULD REWRITE THE STORY OF OUR COSMIC NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU1000000122_S0000005	TODAY, SCIENTISTS HAVE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM PRETTY WELL MAPPED OUT. WE KNOW ABOUT THE EIGHT PLANETS, PLUTO, MOONS, ASTEROIDS, COMETS.
YOU1000000122_S0000006	AND UNTIL RECENTLY, WE THOUGHT WE HAD A HANDLE ON OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD, TOO.
YOU1000000122_S0000008	THERE'S THE ALPHA CENTAURI SYSTEM ABOUT FOUR LIGHT YEARS AWAY, AND BARNARD'S STAR, A RED DWARF A LITTLE FARTHER OUT.
YOU1000000122_S0000009	ASTRONOMERS MADE THESE DISCOVERIES MORE THAN 100 YEARS AGO.
YOU1000000122_S0000010	BUT TODAY, SOME NEW WORK IS TOTALLY UPENDING OUR VIEW OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT INVOLVES A SPACE TELESCOPE, AN ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS, AND A SCIENTIST ON A VERY SPECIFIC MISSION.
YOU1000000122_S0000011	MY NAME IS JACKIE FARRITY AND I'M AN ASTROPHYSICIST AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.
YOU1000000122_S0000012	JACKIE HAS SPENT 15 YEARS SEARCHING OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR NEW NEIGHBORS.
YOU1000000122_S0000013	SHE'S FOCUSED ON MYSTERIOUS WORLDS KNOWN AS BROWN DWARFS, BALLS OF GAS THAT ARE TOO BIG TO BE PLANETS, BUT TOO SMALL TO BE STARS.
YOU1000000122_S0000014	NOW, THEY'RE OFTEN CALLED FAILED STARS, BUT I REALLY DISLIKE THE WORD FAILURE IN THE TITLE.
YOU1000000122_S0000015	BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF DEMEANING TO THE BROWN DWARF.
YOU1000000122_S0000016	LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE A STAR, IT DOESN'T CARE. AND SO OFTENTIMES I CALL THEM OVER EXCITED PLANETS.
YOU1000000122_S0000017	BROWN DWARFS WOULD BE STARS IF THEY WERE MORE MASSIVE, BUT WITHOUT ENOUGH HYDROGEN, THEY DON'T ACHIEVE NUCLEAR FUSION.
YOU1000000122_S0000018	THEY EMIT LOTS OF INFRARED ENERGY, BUT VERY LITTLE VISIBLE LIGHT.
YOU1000000122_S0000019	SO FOR A LONG TIME, THEY WERE HIDDEN TO ASTRONOMERS. BUT THAT ALL CHANGED IN THE 90S.
YOU1000000122_S0000020	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND INFRARED TELESCOPES STARTED TO COME ONLINE IN EARNEST. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU START TO SEE THESE SKY SURVEYS.
YOU1000000122_S0000021	THAT ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE WAVELENGTHS WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE BROWN DWARFS.
YOU1000000122_S0000022	THE FIRST BROWN DWARFS WERE ID'D AROUND 1995, AND SINCE THEN, THE FIELD HAS EXPLODED.
YOU1000000122_S0000023	TODAY, THE ASTRONOMY COMMUNITY IS AWASH IN IMAGERY THAT COULD HARBOR NEARBY BROWN DWARFS.
YOU1000000122_S0000024	ACTUALLY, FINDING THEM IS ANOTHER STORY. BUT THERE'S AN OLD TECHNIQUE CALLED THE BLINK METHOD THAT WORKS WONDERS.
YOU1000000122_S0000025	THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT ALL STARS ARE IN MOTION RELATIVE TO US. MOST ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT THEY MOVE IMPERCEPTIBLY.
YOU1000000122_S0000026	BUT OBJECTS IN OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD, THOSE ARE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CATCH THEIR MOVEMENT, IF WE'RE PATIENT ENOUGH.
YOU1000000122_S0000027	HERE ARE FOUR IMAGES TAKEN WITH VARIOUS TELESCOPES OVER A SPAN OF 32 YEARS.
YOU1000000122_S0000028	IF YOU FLIP OR BLINK THROUGH THEM, YOU SEE THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS STAYING PUT.
YOU1000000122_S0000029	OBJECTS OF INTEREST THAT ARE IN THE NEARBY VICINITY, THEY WILL MOVE, THEY WILL JUMP AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF STARS.
YOU1000000122_S0000030	THAT IS LUMEN 16, A PAIR OF BROWN DWARFS THAT'S ONLY 6.5 LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH. IT WAS DISCOVERED USING THE BLINK METHOD IN 2013.
YOU1000000122_S0000031	AND IT'S NOW THE THIRD CLOSEST KNOWN SYSTEM TO OURS.
YOU1000000122_S0000032	WE HAD NOT CHANGED THAT LIST OF OBJECTS IN THE TOP FIVE IN A CENTURY. IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN.
YOU1000000122_S0000033	WE SHOULD NOT BE FINDING OBJECTS ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT ARE SPITTING DISTANCE AWAY FROM US THAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING ALL THIS TIME.
YOU1000000122_S0000034	THE BLINK METHOD ISN'T NEW. CLYDE TOMBAUGH USED IT TO DISCOVER PLUTO BACK IN 1930, AND IT'S BEEN USED TO DISCOVER MOONS, ASTEROIDS, AND DWARF PLANETS.
YOU1000000122_S0000035	BUT PAIRED WITH NEW INFRARED IMAGERY, IT'S SLOWLY BRINGING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD INTO FOCUS. A LITTLE TOO SLOWLY, REALLY.
YOU1000000122_S0000036	A FEW YEARS BACK, JACKIE FOUND HERSELF STARING DOWN MILLIONS OF IMAGES THAT COULD CONTAIN NEW DISCOVERIES. IT WAS DAUNTING.
YOU1000000122_S0000037	I AM SPENDING HOURS OF MY TIME EVERY WEEK BLINKING IMAGES IN MY SPARE TIME.
YOU1000000122_S0000038	AND I CAN'T, IT'S JUST, IT'S FRUSTRATING. IT'S TAKING TOO MUCH TIME AND I'LL NEVER GET THROUGH ALL OF IT.
YOU1000000122_S0000039	THE IMAGES ARE NOISY AND BLURRY AND EACH ONE NEEDED REAL ATTENTION. IT WAS FAR TOO MUCH FOR ANY TEAM TO HANDLE.
YOU1000000122_S0000041	UNLESS THAT TEAM WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
YOU1000000122_S0000042	AND SO THUS SPRUNG OUR CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT.
YOU1000000122_S0000043	AT THE BEGINNING, MY GIRLFRIENDS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS LOOKING FOR JUST A BUNCH OF MOVING PIXELS FOR HOURS.
YOU1000000122_S0000044	STARTING IN 2017, JACKIE AND HER TEAM INVITED THE ENTIRE INTERNET TO GO HUNTING FOR BROWN DWARFS.
YOU1000000122_S0000045	THEIR SYSTEM IS DEAD SIMPLE. USERS LOG INTO A WEBSITE AND MEET THEIR FIRST ASTRONOMY FLIPBOOK.
YOU1000000122_S0000046	THE IMAGES COME IN A SEQUENCE OF FOUR AND IT WILL FLIP, THOSE IMAGES FLIP THROUGH TIME. SO IT SHOWS YOU WHAT THIS POINT IN SPACE LOOKED LIKE.
YOU1000000122_S0000047	IN THIS YEAR AND THEN A LITTLE BIT AFTER AND THEN A LITTLE AFTER AND THEN A LITTLE AFTER.
YOU1000000122_S0000048	YOU'LL KIND OF SEE BLUE AND ORANGE DOTS TYPICALLY THAT ARE EVERYWHERE.
YOU1000000122_S0000049	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STARING AT COLORFUL TELEVISION STATIC.
YOU1000000122_S0000050	IT CAN BE KIND OF ANNOYING AT FIRST IF YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
YOU1000000122_S0000051	BUT IF YOU'RE LUCKY, YOU'LL CATCH A MOVER.
YOU1000000122_S0000052	WHEN YOU FINALLY FIND SOMETHING MOVING, IT'S A BIT OF AN ADRENALINE RUSH.
YOU1000000122_S0000053	FASTER MOVING OBJECTS ACTUALLY DO BLINK ACROSS THE SCREEN. SLOWER ONES MIGHT JUST TWINKLE.
YOU1000000122_S0000054	THEY'RE BASICALLY THESE LITTLE TINY WHITE DOTS THAT WILL FLASH WHEN YOU PLAY OUR FLIP BOOKS.
YOU1000000122_S0000055	EITHER WAY, YOU CAN MARK YOUR ANOMALY AND ALERT THE COMMUNITY.
YOU1000000122_S0000057	I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING AND EVERYONE ELSE KIND OF IS LIKE, YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S ONE. IT'S LIKE, AH, YES, I'M GOOD. I FOUND SOMETHING.
YOU1000000122_S0000058	THE MOST PROMISING LEADS END UP ON JACKIE'S RADAR. HER TEAM CAN THEN BOOK TELESCOPE TIME TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY. FOR YOU, CITIZEN SCIENTIST, IT'S BACK TO BLINKING.
YOU1000000122_S0000059	IT'S LIKE IN A WORLD, IT'S LIKE A TREASURE HUNT IN YOUR COUCH. IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT KEEPS YOU HOOKED.
YOU1000000122_S0000060	SINCE BACKYARD WORLDS LAUNCHED, VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEEN ON A TEAR.
YOU1000000122_S0000061	THEY'VE DISCOVERED HUNDREDS, HUNDREDS OF NEARBY OBJECTS.
YOU1000000122_S0000062	SOME WERE A NOVEL KIND OF COMPACT FROZEN WORLD.
YOU1000000122_S0000063	PRIOR TO BACKYARD WORLDS, THERE WAS ONLY 24 OF THEM KNOWN. THEY ADDED FIVE NEW ONES.
YOU1000000122_S0000064	OTHERS HAD SURPRISING NEW ATMOSPHERES.
YOU1000000122_S0000065	REALLY STRANGE LOOKING OBJECTS.
YOU1000000122_S0000066	AND STILL OTHERS WERE HIDDEN SIBLINGS OF KNOWN OBJECTS.
YOU1000000122_S0000067	I HAD CERTAINLY STUDIED THE BROWN DWARF IN THE SYSTEM A LOT IN PREVIOUS WORK AND NEVER DID I GUESS THAT IT HAD A LITTLE COLD COMPANION WITH IT.
YOU1000000122_S0000068	ALL IN, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF USERS HAVE FOUND MORE THAN 1,500 NEW OBJECTS.
YOU1000000122_S0000069	VOLUNTEERS LIKE DAN AND GUILLAUME HAVE GOTTEN CREDITS AND ACADEMIC PAPERS FOR THEIR DISCOVERIES.
YOU1000000122_S0000070	THERE'S STILL MORE TO FIND. JACKIE THINKS THE EFFORT COULD REVEAL A BROWN DWARF EVEN CLOSER THAN ALPHA CENTAURI.
YOU1000000122_S0000071	A NEW NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR. THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE WE COULD FIND THE BIGFOOT OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. PLANET 9.
YOU1000000122_S0000072	THERE IS AN OBJECT THAT'S THEORIZED TO EXIST BEYOND PLUTO THAT IS MASSIVE, THAT IT COULD BE CAUSING SOME OBJECTS IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM TO BE BUMPED AROUND A BIT.
YOU1000000122_S0000073	AND IT'S AN EXCITING PROSPECT. NOW, DOES IT EXIST? I DON'T KNOW. I'M HAPPY THAT WE HAVE CITIZENS THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO FIND IT.
YOU1000000122_S0000074	IF IT'S REAL, IF IT'S THERE, AND MAYBE IT IS.
YOU1000000122_S0000076	AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE BLINK METHOD IS, IT HAS COMPETITION. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN HUGE FOR ASTRONOMERS WHO NEED TO SIFT THROUGH TONS OF IMAGERY, INCLUDING JACKIE.
YOU1000000122_S0000077	THE HUMAN EYE IS BEAUTIFUL AT PICKING OUT THINGS.
YOU1000000122_S0000078	IT'S JUST SLOW BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO IMAGE BY IMAGE. AND SO, HUMAN EYE WINS IN SOME WAYS, BUT AI WINS IN SPEED. SO, I USE BOTH.
YOU1000000122_S0000079	ONE LIMITATION OF AI IS THAT IT NEEDS TO TRAIN USING EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT IT'S LOOKING FOR. SO IF THAT THING IS BRAND NEW, HUMAN BRAINS HAVE THE EDGE.
YOU1000000122_S0000080	YOU ARE THE TRAINED ALGORITHM AT THAT POINT.
YOU1000000122_S0000081	THAT SAID, ASTRONOMY IS FACING A TOTAL WAVE OF DATA.
YOU1000000122_S0000082	IN A COUPLE YEARS, ASTRONOMERS WILL BEGIN IMAGING THE ENTIRE NIGHT SKY OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, TWICE A WEEK.
YOU1000000122_S0000083	THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH ALL OF THE DATA IN THE CLASSIC WAYS IN THE COMING FUTURE. LIKE, IT'S OVER.
YOU1000000122_S0000084	FOR NOW, JACKIE WILL TAKE ALL THE HELP SHE CAN GET, FROM HUMAN VOLUNTEERS TO ALGORITHMS. THE HUMANS ARE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000122_S0000085	YOU SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS POURING THROUGH IMAGES AND DESIGNING CUSTOM ALGORITHMS AND SERVICES AND YOU GET SOMETHING GREAT.
YOU1000000122_S0000086	IT'S SUPER EXCITING TO SEE THAT ALL OF THIS WORK THAT WE PUT IN HAS AN IMPACT.
YOU1000000122_S0000087	YOU CAN SAY TO YOURSELF, YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING I SAW.
YOU1000000122_S0000088	AND I'M THE FIRST HUMAN BEING IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF MANKIND TO SEE IT. IT'S A GREAT FEELING.
YOU1000000122_S0000090	THANK YOU TO LEXUS FOR THEIR SUPPORT. BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE NEW LEXUS IS BY GOING TO LEXUS.COM SLASH IS.
YOU1000000122_S0000091	THEIR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT GOING ALL IN ON YOUR PASSION AND GETTING A GREATER REWARD, WHICH IS WHY THEY SPONSORED THIS SERIES ON RESEARCHERS AND INNOVATORS.
YOU1000000122_S0000092	THEY DON'T INFLUENCE OUR EDITORIAL, BUT THEY DO HELP MAKE VIDEOS LIKE THIS VIABLE. SO THANKS AGAIN TO THEM, AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
YOU1000000123_S0000000	SO, HOW SHALL I BEGIN? THIS IS THE BLURB FOR THE COURSE.
YOU1000000123_S0000001	THAT'S BEEN IN THE YALE CATALOG FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS A COURSE ON FINANCE.
YOU1000000123_S0000002	IT HAS THE WORD MARKETS IN THE NAME, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IT'S ABOUT TRADING.
YOU1000000123_S0000004	UM...
YOU1000000123_S0000006	BUT I THINK IT'S A BROAD COURSE IN FINANCE.
YOU1000000123_S0000007	SO THE BLURB SAYS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE A PILLAR OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY.
YOU1000000123_S0000008	DIRECTING RESOURCES ACROSS SPACE AND TIME TO THEIR BEST USES. SO THIS SOUNDS BROADER. I GUESS THE COURSE IS BROADER.
YOU1000000123_S0000009	I WROTE THE TITLE OF THE COURSE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I CREATED THIS COURSE.
YOU1000000123_S0000010	AND IT'S BEEN A TITLE FOR IT.
YOU1000000123_S0000012	SO WHAT REALLY, TO ME, THIS COURSE IS ABOUT IS HOW WE GET THINGS DONE IN OUR SOCIETY.
YOU1000000123_S0000013	THAT'S HOW WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS. NOW, MOST OF US ARE IN OUR LIVES THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES.
YOU1000000123_S0000014	THAT'S HUMAN NATURE. AND ABOUT OUR PARTICULAR...
YOU1000000123_S0000016	PLACE IN THE LIFE CYCLE. SO YOU MAY BE A YOUNG PERSON WHO'S THINKING ABOUT GETTING STARTED IN LIFE.
YOU1000000123_S0000017	BUT WHEN YOU JOIN AN ENTERPRISE OR AN ORGANIZATION, YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS FOR THE ORGANIZATION.
YOU1000000123_S0000018	AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.
YOU1000000123_S0000020	YOU HAVE TO HELP MANAGE A PRODUCTIVE VENTURE THAT INVOLVES MANY PEOPLE. SO THERE AREN'T THAT MANY THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL.
YOU1000000123_S0000021	THAT ARE USEFUL. YOU HAVE TO JOIN AN ORGANIZATION. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN LIFE.
YOU1000000123_S0000023	SO THIS IS A COURSE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE INSTITUTIONS WORK AND HOW WE CAN PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
YOU1000000123_S0000025	AND THINGS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING IN THE INFORMATION AGE THAT WE LIVE IN NOW.
YOU1000000123_S0000027	SO THAT'S WHAT THIS COURSE IS ABOUT. I DON'T CONSIDER THIS A VOCATIONAL COURSE.
YOU1000000123_S0000028	BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO ANYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED IN HOW THINGS WORK.
YOU1000000123_S0000030	ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS COURSE...
YOU1000000123_S0000032	COMES ACROSS AS MORE VOCATIONAL THAN MOST YALE COURSES. AND AT SOME EXTENT, I PRIDE MYSELF ON THAT.
YOU1000000123_S0000033	ALTHOUGH I CONSIDER MYSELF AN INTELLECTUAL. BUT THIS IS A RELEVANT COURSE. IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE MONEY.
YOU1000000123_S0000034	YOU MIGHT SAY IT IS, I SUPPOSE, BUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING THINGS WORK.
YOU1000000123_S0000036	THESE ARE THE TOPICS IN THIS COURSE. RISK INSURANCE, DIVERSIFICATION, HISTORY OF FINANCE, INNOVATION, EFFICIENT MARKETS, BEHAVIORAL FINANCE.
YOU1000000123_S0000037	ACTUALLY, BEHAVIORAL FINANCE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PROMINENT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK FROM ITS APPEARANCE AS NUMBER SEVEN ON THIS LIST.
YOU1000000123_S0000038	BEHAVIORAL FINANCE IS THE APPLICATION OF PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES TO UNDERSTANDING FINANCIAL EVENTS.
YOU1000000123_S0000040	IT'S A REVOLUTION IN FINANCE THAT I HAVE WATCHED OVER THE WHOLE COURSE OF IT, BECAUSE I HAVE ORGANIZED CONFERENCES ON BEHAVIORAL FINANCE.
YOU1000000123_S0000041	STARTING IN 1991, WORKING WITH RICHARD THALER AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.
YOU1000000123_S0000042	WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR 25 YEARS, BUT WE JUST BEQUEATHED IT. THERE ARE REGULAR SEMINARS OF PROFESSORS.
YOU1000000123_S0000043	TO NICK BARBERIS HERE AT THE YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT.
YOU1000000123_S0000045	BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I KIND OF BELIEVE IN A UNITY OF KNOWLEDGE.
YOU1000000123_S0000046	SO THIS COURSE WILL DIFFER FROM MANY OTHER FINANCE COURSES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AND HOW THINGS REALLY WORK.
YOU1000000123_S0000048	UH...
YOU1000000123_S0000050	THEN WE TALK ABOUT DEBT, THE STOCK MARKET, THE REAL ESTATE MARKET, REGULATION. OH, BY THE WAY, REGULATION IS AN INTEREST OF MINE TOO.
YOU1000000123_S0000051	MORE SO THAN MOST PEOPLE WHO TEACH FINANCE, BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE MARKETS NEED TO BE REGULATED.
YOU1000000123_S0000052	HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE MANIPULATIVE AND TRICKY, AND FINANCE IS USED TO TRICK PEOPLE.
YOU1000000123_S0000053	THAT'S WHY WE NEED REGULATORS. SO YOU SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT I WANT TO SEND YOU OFF TO WALL STREET.
YOU1000000123_S0000054	I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT GO TO BE A MEMBER OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR SOMETHING ELSE AS A JOB.
YOU1000000123_S0000055	AND BE PROUD OF IT, OKAY? IT'S IMPORTANT.
YOU1000000123_S0000057	AND THEN BANKING, FUTURES, FUTURES MARKET, THAT HAS A SPECIAL MEANING IN FINANCE.
YOU1000000123_S0000058	MONETARY POLICY, ENDOWMENT MANAGEMENT, INVESTMENT BANKING, OPTIONS, MONEY MANAGERS, EXCHANGES, PUBLIC FINANCE.
YOU1000000123_S0000059	NON PROFITS. AND FINALLY, THAT LAST LECTURE WILL BE ON THE PURPOSE OF ALL THIS.
YOU1000000123_S0000060	SO THAT'S THIS COURSE.
YOU1000000123_S0000062	SO I WANTED ALSO TO JUST REFLECT ON THE RELATIVE, I SAID THIS COURSE LOOKS MORE VOCATIONAL.
YOU1000000123_S0000063	IN A WAY, BUT I DON'T CONSIDER THIS VOCATIONAL SCHOOL.
YOU1000000123_S0000065	I'D LIKE TO SAY USEFUL.
YOU1000000123_S0000067	ONE THOUGHT, PERSPECTIVE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU WAS HOW IMPORTANT IS FINANCE ANYWAY? UNLESS YOU GO INTO ACADEMIA.
YOU1000000123_S0000068	YOU WILL GET A JOB SOMEWHERE IN THE REAL WORLD. SO WHERE ARE THE JOBS?
YOU1000000123_S0000069	WELL, I LOOKED UP ON THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, IT WAS A PUBLICATION OF THE US GOVERNMENT, ON THEIR WEBSITE.
YOU1000000123_S0000070	THEY HAVE DATA ON JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000123_S0000071	AND THEY ALSO HAVE A FORECAST. SO WHAT I'M SHOWING, THE LATEST DATA, IS FOR THE YEAR 2014.
YOU1000000123_S0000072	AND IT HAS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THOUSANDS. AND THEN ALSO ON THERE WE HAVE THE PROJECTION FOR 2024.
YOU1000000123_S0000073	SO YOU NOTE THAT AT THE TOP, I'VE GOT FINANCE. THESE ARE SPECIFIC FINANCE PROFESSIONS, NOT ALL FINANCE PROFESSIONS.
YOU1000000123_S0000074	FINANCIAL ANALYSTS, FINANCIAL MANAGERS, PERSONAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS.
YOU1000000123_S0000075	THEY ALL HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. BUT I WANTED YOU TO NOTE, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MAJORS THAT YOU HAVE HERE? I'M NOT DIMINISHING THEM.
YOU1000000123_S0000076	BUT ECONOMICS, ECONOMISTS, NOT SO MANY.
YOU1000000123_S0000078	BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN ASTRONOMY. I ACTUALLY LOVE ASTRONOMY. WHEN I WAS A KID, I THOUGHT I'D BE AN ASTRONOMER.
YOU1000000123_S0000079	BUT I HAD TO REACH REALITY. THERE'S LOTS OF EXCITING FIELDS.
YOU1000000123_S0000080	WHERE THERE ARE ALMOST NO JOBS. SO THERE'S, HOW MANY ASTRONOMERS ARE THERE?
YOU1000000123_S0000082	SOCIOLOGISTS, POLITICAL SCIENTISTS, OR MATHEMATICIANS. THIS IS NOT TO DIMINISH YOUR MAJORING IN THOSE FIELDS.
YOU1000000123_S0000083	BUT YOU JUST DON'T EXPECT TO GET A JOB IN THOSE FIELDS.
YOU1000000123_S0000084	I ALSO PUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM, MASSAGE THERAPIST. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS A PROFESSION.
YOU1000000123_S0000085	BUT THERE'S PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT 200,000 MASSAGE THERAPISTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2024.
YOU1000000123_S0000086	SO WE DON'T HAVE A MASSAGE THERAPY MAJOR HERE.
YOU1000000123_S0000087	BUT THAT'S A SIGN OF.
YOU1000000123_S0000089	HOW THE MARKET MAKES THINGS IMPORTANT.
YOU1000000123_S0000090	NOW RANA FARAHAR MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAVING SO MANY FINANCE PEOPLE. MAYBE WE NEED MORE MASSAGE THERAPISTS.
YOU1000000123_S0000091	FINANCE PEOPLE.
YOU1000000123_S0000092	BUT THERE'S A SENSE OF REALITY THAT I THINK THAT...
YOU1000000123_S0000093	PART OF THE REASON THAT THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM IS THAT THEY DEAL WITH IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT CAN'T BE QUICKLY
YOU1000000123_S0000094	IT CAN'T BE MORE EASILY SOLVED. WE NEED ALL THESE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY I TAKE SOME PRIDE IN THIS COURSE IN BEING CONNECTED TO THE REAL WORLD.
YOU1000000123_S0000095	THERE ARE REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN FINANCE. AND THERE ARE ALSO, I THINK, IN THE NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION PERIOD,
YOU1000000123_S0000096	THEY WILL STILL BE. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FIELDS THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE
YOU1000000123_S0000098	TOTALLY REPLACED BY A COMPUTER. THE PROBLEM WITH FINANCE IS THAT THERE IS A HIGH INEQUALITY IN THIS FIELD.
YOU1000000123_S0000099	SOME PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY. THIS IS ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS COURSE.
YOU1000000123_S0000100	IF YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IN FINANCE, IT'S A GAME, YOU ENJOYED IT, NOW GIVE MOST OF IT AWAY. THAT'S GOING TO BE A THEME.
YOU1000000124_S0000000	SO I'M ON A LONG AND CIRCUITOUS ROUTE AND I'LL ONLY ARRIVE AT THAT AGAIN AT THE END.
YOU1000000124_S0000002	SO, THERE'S BEEN A BATTLE GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE NATURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND WHAT ITS NATURE SHOULD BE.
YOU1000000124_S0000003	THERE'S TWO VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES. THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES. ONE IS INSPIRED BY LOGIC.
YOU1000000124_S0000004	AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE ESSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE IS USING SYMBOLIC RULES TO MANIPULATE SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS.
YOU1000000124_S0000005	AND THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED THIS, OR THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IT, DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS EMPIRICAL. THEY THOUGHT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HAVE INTELLIGENCE. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A SORT OF NECESSARY TRUTH THAT THAT'S WHAT INTELLIGENCE WAS GOING TO BE.
YOU1000000124_S0000007	THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EQUALLY IDEOLOGICAL WHO BELIEVED THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM YOU SHOULD LOOK TO BIOLOGY.
YOU1000000124_S0000008	AND IN PARTICULAR, SHOOT. TRY AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN WAS DOING IT.
YOU1000000124_S0000010	AND IT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF THE BRAINS OF ANIMALS ARE DOING IT BY LOGIC. OF COURSE, THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER ANIMALS ARE INTELLIGENT, BUT...
YOU1000000124_S0000012	THE BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE ESSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE WAS LEARNING THE CONNECTION STRENGTHS OF THE NEURAL NETWORK.
YOU1000000124_S0000013	AND YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD VIEWS. THEY KIND OF MISS EACH OTHER.
YOU1000000124_S0000015	SO, THERE'S A BATTLE THAT WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME. IN THE 1960S, WE HAD VERY SIMPLE NEURAL NETS AND WE HAD A SIMPLE LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR THEM.
YOU1000000124_S0000017	THEY ONLY HAVE ONE LAYER OF FEATURES, AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT BY SIMULACRA.
YOU1000000124_S0000019	SO WHEN I STARTED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THE 1970S, IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT NEURAL NETWORKS WERE NONSENSE, THEY WERE THE PAST, THEY WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING AND IT HAD BEEN PROVED THAT THEY WERE USELESS.
YOU1000000124_S0000021	THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD. AND THAT'S WHAT ALMOST EVERYBODY NOW BELIEVES.
YOU1000000124_S0000023	THEN IN THE 1980S...
YOU1000000124_S0000025	VARIOUS GROUPS CAME UP WITH THE BACK PROPAGATION PROCEDURE AND THAT ALLOWED NEURAL NETWORKS TO LEARN MULTIPLE LAYERS OF FEATURES.
YOU1000000124_S0000027	SO WE GOT OVER THIS PROBLEM THAT UNTIL THEN NEURAL NETWORKS JUST HAD HAND DESIGNED FEATURES, THEY WAITED THOSE FEATURES TO MAKE A DECISION, AND THEN THEY MADE A DECISION.
YOU1000000124_S0000028	THEY DIDN'T LEARN THEIR OWN FEATURES. WITH BACKPROPAGATION WE COULD LEARN LESSER FEATURES, AND THERE'S A LOT OF HYPE ABOUT HOW THIS WAS GOING TO SOLVE EVERYTHING. AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVED.
YOU1000000124_S0000029	THAT IS, I BELIEVED IN THE 80S THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THEN, AND IT DIDN'T.
YOU1000000124_S0000031	IN THE 1990S
YOU1000000124_S0000033	PEOPLE SHOWED THERE WERE OTHER MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT WORKED BETTER THAN BACKPROPAGATION ON MODEST SIZED PROBLEMS. THINGS CALLED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES.
YOU1000000124_S0000034	THEY HAD FANCIER MATH, AND THEY WORKED A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON WHAT WE NOW THINK OF AS VERY SMALL PROBLEMS, THINGS WITH A FEW THOUSAND TRAINING EXAMPLES.
YOU1000000124_S0000036	SO YOUR LAB WILL WIPE THAT AGAIN.
YOU1000000124_S0000038	THEN, IN ABOUT 2006, WE CAME UP WITH SOME TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO NEURAL NETWORKS THAT MADE THEM A BIT EASIER TO LEARN.
YOU1000000124_S0000039	AND THAT WASN'T THE MAIN POINT. AT THAT TIME, WE GOT MORE COMPUTATION AND MORE DATA. AND SUDDENLY, NEURAL NETWORKS WITH LOTS OF LAYERS OF FEATURES WORKED AMAZINGLY WELL.
YOU1000000124_S0000040	AND NOW GOOGLE, AND FACEBOOK, AND MICROSOFT, AND APPLE, AND AMAZON, AND ALL THE OTHER HIGH TECH COMPANIES YOU CAN THINK OF, NVIDIA FOR ONE, ARE ALL BETTING THE FARM ON NEURAL NETWORKS.
YOU1000000124_S0000041	THEY BELIEVE THAT'S SUDDENLY TO BE THE FUTURE. AND THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND FOR STUDENTS WHO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NEURAL NETWORKS.
YOU1000000124_S0000043	SO, THE OLD WAY TO MAKE A COMPUTER DO WHAT YOU WANTED WAS TO WRITE A PROGRAM.
YOU1000000124_S0000044	WHERE YOU FIGURED OUT HOW YOU WOULD DO IT YOURSELF, AND THEN YOU EXPLAIN TO THE COMPUTER IN EXQUISITE DETAIL HOW TO DO WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE YOURSELF, BUT A WHOLE LOT FASTER.
YOU1000000124_S0000046	SO IF I WANTED TO SORT A LIST, FOR EXAMPLE, I WOULD FIGURE OUT, WELL, I'M NOT A COMPUTER SCIENTIST, WHICH WE'LL QUICKLY REALIZE.
YOU1000000124_S0000047	I WOULD FIGURE OUT, WELL, I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST AND FIND THE BIGGEST THING AND THEN PUT THAT AT THE TOP. AND THEN I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST AGAIN AND FIND THE NEXT BIGGEST THING AND PUT THAT UNDERNEATH THOSE THINGS.
YOU1000000124_S0000048	IT'S NOT A GOOD ALGORITHM, BUT I MIGHT DECIDE TO DO IT LIKE THAT. AND THEN I COULD TELL THE COMPUTER TO DO THAT, AND THEN THE COMPUTER WOULD SORT OF LIST FASTER THAN I COULD.
YOU1000000124_S0000050	THE NEW WAY TO DO IT IS TO, YOU FIRST TELL THE COMPUTER TO PRETEND TO BE A NEURAL NETWORK.
YOU1000000124_S0000052	AND THEN YOU JUST SHOW IT EXAMPLES. SO YOU'VE SHOWN AN EXAMPLE OF AN UNSORTED LIST AND A SORTED LIST. AND YOU SHOW LOTS OF EXAMPLES, AND YOU SAY, I WANT YOU TO TAKE THESE THINGS AND PRODUCE THOSE THINGS.
YOU1000000124_S0000053	AND AFTER A WHILE HE GETS THE IDEA. THAT IS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THE PROGRAM.
YOU1000000124_S0000055	SORTING LISTS IS SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THIS WAY. RECOGNIZING OBJECTS AND IMAGES IS SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO THIS WAY.
YOU1000000124_S0000057	SO HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WE'D LIKE COMPUTERS TO DO. AND PEOPLE IN CLASSICAL AI TRIED TO DO THIS FOR 50 YEARS, AND THEY DIDN'T MAKE MUCH PROGRESS.
YOU1000000124_S0000058	SO THE IDEA IS YOU'RE GIVEN THE RGB VALUES OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PIXELS, AND YOU HAVE TO CONVERT THOSE TO A CAPTION THAT DESCRIBES WHAT'S IN THE IMAGE.
YOU1000000124_S0000059	SO YOU GET ALL THESE NUMBERS COMING IN, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STRING OF WORDS COMING OUT.
YOU1000000124_S0000061	AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW YOU MIGHT GO ABOUT WRITING A PROGRAM TO DO THAT, BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.
YOU1000000124_S0000062	YOU FIRST OF ALL WOULD MAYBE WRITE A PROGRAM TO FIND LITTLE PIECES OF EDGE IN THE IMAGE, OR MAYBE COLOR CONTRAST.
YOU1000000124_S0000063	AND JUST DOING REVISION WOULD BE MORE THAN YOU COULD DO.
YOU1000000124_S0000065	AND THEN RELATING THIS VISION TO THE LANGUAGE WOULD BE COMPLICATED. NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM JUST BY USING MACHINE LEARNING.
YOU1000000124_S0000067	WITH HARDLY ANY HAND PROBLEMS.
YOU1000000124_S0000069	AND BY THE END OF THE LECTURE, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND HOW WE DO THAT.
YOU1000000124_S0000071	OKAY, IS THAT LOUDER? GOOD. OKAY. I THINK THE MIC WAS TURNED OFF.
YOU1000000124_S0000073	SO, I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN, MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY, BUT I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN WHAT LARGE MEASURING NEURON IS. IT'S A LITTLE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICE.
YOU1000000124_S0000074	IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A REAL NEURON, BUT NOT VERY. IT TAKES SOME INPUTS, COMING TYPICALLY FROM OTHER NEURONS. IT HAS WEIGHTS ON THE CONNECTIONS.
YOU1000000124_S0000075	HE TAKES THE INPUTS TIMES THE WEIGHTS, ADDS IT UP, THAT'S HIS TOTAL INPUT, AND THEN HE PUTS IT THROUGH A NONLINEAR FUNCTION.
YOU1000000124_S0000076	THAT NONLINEAR FUNCTION ON THE RIGHT THERE IS WHAT WE MOSTLY USE NOW, AND THAT'S ITS OUTPUT.
YOU1000000124_S0000077	SO BASICALLY THAT NONLINEAR FUNCTION SIMPLY SAYS, IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF INPUT, GIVE A LOT OF OUTPUT, AND IF YOUR INPUT'S BELOW THE THRESHOLD, DON'T GIVE ANY OUTPUT.
YOU1000000124_S0000078	SO IT'S CALLED A RECTIFIED LEADING EDGE.
YOU1000000124_S0000080	AND THE QUESTION IS, IF YOU HOOK TOGETHER A BUNCH OF THOSE GUYS, AND YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THOSE WEIGHTS ON THE CONNECTIONS ADAPT, WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?
YOU1000000124_S0000082	SO WE TYPICALLY HOOK THEM TOGETHER BY MAKING MULTIPLE LAYERS. THIS AGAIN IS SORT OF NEURALLY INSPIRED. AND IF YOU LOOK AT A MULTI LAYER NEURAL NETWORK LIKE THAT,
YOU1000000124_S0000084	THE LAYERS IN THE MIDDLE, IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WEIGHTS SHOULD BE. WHEN YOU ADAPT THOSE WEIGHTS, IN EFFECT YOU'RE DECIDING WHAT FEATURES
YOU1000000124_S0000085	THE NEURONS IN THE MIDDLE EDGE SHOULD DETECT. SO THE PROBLEM OF ADAPTING THOSE WEIGHTS IS THE PROBLEM OF DECIDING WHAT INTERMEDIATE FEATURES DO YOU WANT. THEY'RE THE SAME PROBLEM.
YOU1000000124_S0000087	NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A WAY OF LEARNING THOSE FEATURES THAT'S REALLY STUPID.
YOU1000000124_S0000088	BUT WE'LL DEFINITELY WORK. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT INPUTS, AND WE'RE GOING TO TELL IT WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS.
YOU1000000124_S0000089	AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ADAPT THE WEIGHTS ONE AT A TIME.
YOU1000000124_S0000091	SO SUPPOSE WE WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PICTURES OF CATS AND PICTURES OF DOGS. WE GIVE IT TWO OUT, THAT'S ONE FOR CAT AND ONE FOR DOG.
YOU1000000124_S0000092	AND IF YOU SHOW A CAT, AND THE APPLE FOR DOG IS HIGHER THAN THE APPLE FOR CAT, THAT'S BAD. SO WE CAN SHOW A BUNCH OF PICTURES AND MEASURE HOW WELL IT'S DOING.
YOU1000000124_S0000094	AND THEN WE CAN PICK ONE OF THE WEIGHTS IN THE NETWORK, AND WE CAN CHANGE THE VALUE OF THAT WEIGHT.
YOU1000000124_S0000096	AND WE CAN SEE IF THE NETWORK IS DOING BETTER OR WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE. TO SEE THAT, YOU NEED TO SHOW A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES.
YOU1000000124_S0000097	IF THE CHANGE WORKED, WE KEEP IT. AND THEN WE DO IT AGAIN, BUT ANOTHER WAY.
YOU1000000124_S0000099	NOW, I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT ALGORITHM IS GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES FOR EACH WEIGHT. AND IF YOU'VE GOT A MILLION WEIGHTS, IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY SLOW.
YOU1000000124_S0000101	BUT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO. WE WANT TO CHANGE WEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION THAT MAKES THEM HELP. THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO THAT EFFICIENTLY.
YOU1000000124_S0000102	AND BACK PROPAGATION, WHICH MANY OF YOU KNOW, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT.
YOU1000000124_S0000103	IT'S JUST AN EFFICIENT WAY OF COMPUTING HOW TO CHANGE THE WEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION THAT WILL HELP REDUCE THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT THE NETWORK OUTPUTS AND WHAT YOU'D LIKE IT TO OUTPUT.
YOU1000000124_S0000105	AND THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU PERTURB THE WEIGHTS, YOU MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE OF WEIGHT ON THE OUTPUT.
YOU1000000124_S0000106	AND WITH BACKPROPAGATION YOU COMPUTE THE EFFECTS. SO IF YOU KNOW ALL THE WEIGHTS IN THE NETWORK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE, YOU COMPUTE.
YOU1000000124_S0000107	AND WHEN YOU COMPUTE, YOU CAN COMPUTE FOR ALL THE WEIGHTS AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT DIRECTION YOU SHOULD CHANGE THEM TO HAVE.
YOU1000000124_S0000108	YOU CAN'T DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE ONE AT A TIME.
YOU1000000124_S0000110	SO COMPUTING IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN MEASURING. EVOLUTION CAN'T DO THE SAME MEASURING, CAN'T DO THE SAME COMPUTING. IN EVOLUTION YOU CHANGE A GENE.
YOU1000000124_S0000111	AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, AND YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THAT, SO YOU CAN'T BACK UP AGAIN.
YOU1000000124_S0000113	SO WHAT EVOLUTION DID WAS IT CAME UP WITH A BRAIN SO THAT IT COULD USE THAT COGNITION. THAT'S MY THEORY.
YOU1000000124_S0000114	SO IN BACKPROPAGATION, YOU GO FORWARDS THROUGH THESE LAYERS, YOU COMPARE WITH THE CORRECT ANSWER, YOU BACKPROPAGATE SIGNALS, THAT ALLOWS YOU TO COMPUTE FOR EACH WEIGHT WHAT DIRECTION TO CHANGE IT IN, TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER.
YOU1000000124_S0000116	AND WE THOUGHT IN THE 80S THAT WAS PROBLEM SOLVED. WE HAD COME OUT AND DONE LOTS OF THOSE. AND IT DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL.
YOU1000000124_S0000118	AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T WORK. MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE THIS IS A STUPID IDEA. THAT IS, THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A NETWORK WITH RANDOM WEIGHTS,
YOU1000000124_S0000119	AND YOU JUST SHOW THE WORLD DATA. AS A RESULT OF SEEING THIS DATA, IT WILL BE ABLE TO DESIGN ALL ITS OWN FEATURE DETECTORS.
YOU1000000124_S0000120	AND DO VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE OF THINGS LIKE MACHINE TRANSLATION OR RECOGNIZING OBJECTS IN IMAGES OR RECOGNIZING SPEECH.
YOU1000000124_S0000122	ALMOST EVERYBODY IN AI THOUGHT THAT IDEA WAS COMPLETELY CRAZY. A FEW OF US DIDN'T. A FEW OF US JUST THOUGHT, WE DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT WORKING.
YOU1000000124_S0000123	IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND WE DISCOVERED LATER, THE REASON IT WASN'T WORKING WAS BECAUSE COMPUTERS WERE TOO SLOW AND DATA SETS WEREN'T BIG ENOUGH.
YOU1000000124_S0000124	IF YOU'D SAID THAT IN THE 80S, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID, OH YEAH, SURE, IF YOU HAD A BIGGER COMPUTER AND MORE DATA IT WOULD WORK. BUT LOOK, IT DOESN'T WORK. IT TURNED OUT I WAS RIGHT.
YOU1000000124_S0000125	AND WHEN WE GOT A BIGGER COMPUTER AND MORE DATA, IT WORKED. NOW THERE WERE SOME TECHNICAL THINGS TOO, BUT IT WAS MAINLY THE INCREASING COMPUTER SPEED AND DATA SIZE THAT MATTERED.
YOU1000000124_S0000128	SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES BEFORE I GET BACK TO THE ISSUE OF WATER FORTRESS.
YOU1000000124_S0000130	THE EXAMPLE THAT PROBABLY HAD THE MOST IMPACT WAS IN 2012. THERE WAS A BIG PUBLIC COMPETITION WHERE YOU HAVE A THOUSAND DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBJECTS AND A MILLION TRAINING IMAGES.
YOU1000000124_S0000131	AND YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBJECTS. AND THERE'S A SECRET TEST SET, SO YOU CAN'T TUNE ON THE TEST SET.
YOU1000000124_S0000132	AND IT'S COUNTED AS RIGHT IF YOU GET THE CORRECT CLASS IN YOUR TOP FIVE BETS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE RIGHT BET IS FOR SOME OF THEM.
YOU1000000124_S0000133	FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE AN IMAGE WHICH HAS A DALMATIAN IN A BOWL OF CHERRIES. SAME DALMATIAN, SAME CHERRIES. ONE OF THOSE IS RIGHT, AND IF YOU SAY BOTH, YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT.
YOU1000000124_S0000136	SO A LOT OF THE BEST EXISTING COMPUTER VISION METHODS WERE USED, AND THE RESULTS LOOK LIKE THIS.
YOU1000000124_S0000138	THE RESULTS AT THE TOP ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW. THE RESULTS BELOW...
YOU1000000124_S0000140	TWO OF MY GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MANAGED TO GET 16% ERROR.
YOU1000000124_S0000141	AND THEN THE BEST COMPUTER VISION GROUPS WERE GETTING MORE THAN 25%.
YOU1000000124_S0000142	SO WE ALMOST HALVED THE ERROR RATE. AND THAT HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON COMPUTER VISION. ALMOST EVERY NIGHT, THAT IS WITHIN A YEAR.
YOU1000000124_S0000143	ALL THE LIVING PEOPLE CHANGED FROM DOING HAND TUNED THINGS, DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING BEFORE, TO DOING NEURAL NETS.
YOU1000000124_S0000144	AND SO IN 2011, IF YOU SENT A PAPER USING NEURAL NETS TO A COMPUTER VISION CONFERENCE, IT WOULD BE REJECTED BECAUSE IT WAS USING NEURAL NETS.
YOU1000000124_S0000145	AND BY 2015, IF YOU SENT A PAPER TO A COMPUTER VISION CONFERENCE, IT WOULD BE REJECTED IF IT WASN'T USING THE INTERNET. IT WAS REALLY A BIG CHANGE.
YOU1000000124_S0000147	OK. IT WAS OBVIOUS IF TWO GRAD STUDENTS CAN BEAT THE BEST COMPUTER VISION RESEARCHERS WHO'VE BEEN DOING THIS STUFF FOR 30 YEARS, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A LOT FURTHER.
YOU1000000124_S0000148	AND THINGS DID. BY 2015, THE ERROR RATE ON INJURED ERROR STOOD AT 5%, WHICH IS ABOUT THE HUMAN ERROR RATE, AND NOW STANDS AT 3%. IT'S INCREDIBLY GOOD.
YOU1000000124_S0000150	SO I'LL JUST SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT KIND OF OBJECT RECOGNITION.
YOU1000000124_S0000152	SO THERE'S AN IMAGE AND THE RIGHT ANSWER IS CHEETAH. AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE NEURAL NET SAYS, IT'S VERY CONFIDENT THAT CHEETAH'S THE RIGHT ANSWER.
YOU1000000124_S0000153	AND IT HAS A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT THINGS AREN'T TOTALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION, LIKE LEOPARD AND SNOW LEOPARD AND EGYPTIAN CAT. SO ALL ITS BACKUP ANSWERS ARE VERY SENSIBLE ANSWERS.
YOU1000000124_S0000154	AND NOTICE THAT'S NOT A SORT OF TYPICAL IMAGE OF A CHEETAH. HALF THE HEAD'S MISSING, AND IT'S A CHEETAH CLOSE UP, RIGHT?
YOU1000000124_S0000155	IT'S NOT A SORT OF CLASSIC, IT'S NOT THE DIAGRAM OF THE MAKE OF A CHEETAH, JUST TO SHOW SOMEBODY WHAT A CHEETAH IS.
YOU1000000124_S0000157	HERE'S A BULLET TRAIN. AND YOU'LL NOTICE THE BULLET TRAIN PROBABLY OCCUPIES LESS THAN 10% OF THE PIXELS. THE BUILDING IN THE BACKGROUND IS MUCH BIGGER.
YOU1000000124_S0000158	THERE'S A PLATFORM, THERE'S A PERSONAL PLATFORM. BUT IT SORT OF KNOWS WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS LIKELY TO BE BECAUSE IT'S UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE FOCUS OF IMAGES.
YOU1000000124_S0000159	YOU PUT THE THING YOU WANT TO ATTEND TO IN THE MIDDLE. AND ALL ITS ALTERNATIVE ANSWERS ARE QUITE REASONABLE.
YOU1000000124_S0000161	HERE'S WHAT MARGARET SAID WRONGLY.
YOU1000000124_S0000163	SO, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS HAND GLASS.
YOU1000000124_S0000165	IT THINKS THE BEST ANSWER IS SCISSORS. AND YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHY I'M NOT THINKING SCISSORS. YOU CAN SEE BETTER WHY I'M NOT THINKING FRYING PAN.
YOU1000000124_S0000166	IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THING THAT I THINK MUST BE A CHAIN ISN'T THE HANDLE OF A FRAME. BASICALLY IT NEEDS GLASSES.
YOU1000000124_S0000167	YOU CAN SEE WHY IT SAYS STETHOSCOPE. THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT ALL THE WRONG ANSWERS ARE VISUALLY PLAUSIBLE WRONG ANSWERS.
YOU1000000124_S0000168	TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, THAT UNDERSTANDS A LOT ABOUT WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE.
YOU1000000124_S0000170	OKAY, SO THAT ISSUE SHOULD BACK TO COMPUTER VISION. AND THEN A FEW YEARS LATER,
YOU1000000124_S0000171	SOME VERY GREAT PEOPLE, INCLUDING ENYA SATSUKAWA, WHO WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE 2012 IMAGENET SYSTEM.
YOU1000000124_S0000173	DECIDED THEY'D TRY NEURAL NETS ON MACHINE TRANSLATION. AND MACHINE TRANSLATION OUGHT TO BE THE PERFECT PROBLEM FOR SYMBOLIC AI.
YOU1000000124_S0000174	SO PEOPLE IN SYMBOLIC AR, I MEAN, WE ALL AGREE THAT SYMBOLS COME IN AND SYMBOLS COME OUT. OKAY?
YOU1000000124_S0000175	THE QUESTION IS, WHAT'S IN BETWEEN? IS IT JUST MORE SYMBOLS?
YOU1000000124_S0000176	SO THE CLASSIC AI VIEW IS SYMBOLS COME IN, WHAT'S INSIDE IS SORT OF LIKE SYMBOLS, IT'S SORT OF CLEANED UP SYMBOLS.
YOU1000000124_S0000177	IT'S SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS. AND YOU DO MANIPULATIONS ON SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS, AND THEN ANOTHER SYMBOL STRING COMES OUT. SO IT'S CALLED SYMBOLS.
YOU1000000124_S0000179	THE BIOLOGICAL VIEW WOULD BE SYMBOLS COME IN. THEY'RE THE WAY WE CODE THINGS TO GO OVER A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL.
YOU1000000124_S0000180	THEY RESIST NOISE NICELY. ONCE THE SYMBOLS HAVE COME IN, THEY GET CONVERTED INTO THINGS THAT ARE NOTHING LIKE THOSE SYMBOLS.
YOU1000000124_S0000182	SO THE POINT ABOUT A SYMBOL IS IT ONLY HAS BASICALLY ONE PROPERTY. A SYMBOL EITHER IS OR IS NOT IDENTICAL TO ANOTHER SYMBOL.
YOU1000000124_S0000184	IF YOU TAKE TWO DIFFERENT SYMBOLS, THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT MATTERS IS, ARE THEY THE SAME SYMBOL?
YOU1000000124_S0000186	OK? ALL THE OTHER PROPERTIES ARE JUST...
YOU1000000124_S0000188	WELL, IT'S A PROPERTY OF THE SYMBOL THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO THE PROCESS.
YOU1000000124_S0000190	IN NEURAL NETS, WHAT HAPPENS IS A SYMBOL COMES IN, AND IT GETS CONVERTED INTO A GREAT BIG VECTOR THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF FEATURES.
YOU1000000124_S0000191	THAT CAPTURE LOTS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MEANING OF THAT WORD.
YOU1000000124_S0000193	AND WORDS THAT MEAN SIMILAR THINGS BUT DON'T LOOK SIMILAR, LIKE FRIDAY AND WEDNESDAY.
YOU1000000124_S0000195	THEY MEAN PRETTY SIMILAR THINGS. THEY'RE DISTINCT SYMBOLS.
YOU1000000124_S0000197	THERE'S NOTHING, WELL, THERE'S THE MORPHEMING STRUCTURE OF DANE, SO THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE, BUT BASICALLY,
YOU1000000124_S0000199	THEY'RE DISTINCT SYMBOLS, AND THAT'S ALL A SYMBOL PROCESSING SYSTEM LEARNS. IN A NEURAL NET, IT LEARNS THAT WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY ARE VERY, VERY SIMILAR THINGS. AND WE'LL SEE THAT LATER.
YOU1000000124_S0000201	SO THE SYMBOLIC AI CRITICAL MACHINE TRANSLATION IS TO SAY, OK, A SIMPLE STRING COMES IN IN ENGLISH.
YOU1000000124_S0000202	WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME MANIPULATIONS USING RULES, AND WE'RE CLEARLY GOING TO USE RULES OF GRAMMAR. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE SEMANTIC RULES THAT SOMEHOW DO COMPOSITIONAL SEMANTICS.
YOU1000000124_S0000203	THAT IS, GIVEN WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES MEAN, THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT A GROUP OF PIECES MUST MEAN. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE SYMBOLS COMING IN.
YOU1000000124_S0000205	AND WE'RE GOING TO USE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT LINGUISTS HAVE ABOUT HOW LANGUAGE WORKS.
YOU1000000124_S0000207	THE NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH. NOW, EVEN I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BIT CRAZY, A BIT AMBITIOUS.
YOU1000000124_S0000208	IS TO SAY, LET'S JUST TAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF TRANSLATIONS, PAIRS OF AN ENGLISH SENTENCE AND A FRENCH SENTENCE.
YOU1000000124_S0000210	AND WE'LL STICK IN THE ENGLISH SENTENCE ONE WORD AT A TIME. AND THEN WE'LL GO INTO A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK, WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN A MINUTE, WHERE THINGS CYCLE AROUND INSIDE.
YOU1000000124_S0000212	AND AFTER WE FINISH STICKING THE ENGLISH SENTENCE, THAT RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WILL HAVE SOME PARTICULAR STATE OF ACTIVITY. AND WE'LL CALL THAT A THOUGHT VECTOR.
YOU1000000124_S0000214	THAT'S WHAT A THOUGHT IS. IT'S THE STATE OF ACTIVITY OF THE NEURAL NET AFTER IT'S READ THE ENGLISH SENTENCE.
YOU1000000124_S0000216	AND YOU'LL NOTICE IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE WORD THOUGHT WORKS IN ENGLISH, I CAN SAY
YOU1000000125_S0000000	WELL, I'LL TELL YOU A COUPLE OF STRANGE THINGS THAT THINGS THAT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE FIRST IS WHEN WE'VE DONE THE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROGRAM
YOU1000000125_S0000001	IT HAS HAD A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000002	AND IT'S HAD A PARTICULARLY DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON WHAT I WOULD CALL EXCLUDED MEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000003	SO THAT WOULD BE NON WESTERN ETHNIC MINORITY MEN OR OR WHAT
YOU1000000125_S0000004	MAJORITY MEN WHO AREN'T DOING VERY WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE AT MOHAWK COLLEGE
YOU1000000125_S0000005	THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROGRAM HAD A PARTICULARLY ROBUST EFFECT ON MOHAWK COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WERE MEN WHO HADN'T DONE VERY WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WHO HADN'T PICKED A MAJOR
YOU1000000125_S0000006	THAT HAD A CAREER DESTINATION AT ITS END.
YOU1000000125_S0000007	SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THOSE PEOPLE ARE THEY HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IDEA OF EDUCATION
YOU1000000125_S0000008	AND THEY'RE NOT ORIENTED SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS A GOAL. THEY'RE NOT VERY MOTIVATED.
YOU1000000125_S0000010	NOW, WHY DID IT HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT ON MEN? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
YOU1000000125_S0000012	WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE WOMEN ARE DOING BETTER.
YOU1000000125_S0000013	SO IT MIGHT JUST BE A MATTER OF THE FACT THAT IT DOES BETTER FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DOING AS WELL AND AT THE MOMENT MOST OF THEM ARE MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000014	I DON'T BELIEVE... I THINK THAT MIGHT BE PART OF IT, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S ALL OF IT.
YOU1000000125_S0000015	I THINK THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT WOMEN ARE DOING BETTER IS BECAUSE THEY'RE AGREEABLE. AND SO IF A SYSTEM SETS OUT A STRUCTURE AND SAYS, HERE'S A PATHWAY TO ATTAINMENT,
YOU1000000125_S0000016	THE WOMEN WON'T REBEL AGAINST THAT, THEY'LL GO ALONG WITH IT, AND THAT'S WORKING VERY WELL FOR THEM AT THE MOMENT.
YOU1000000125_S0000017	THE MEN, ESPECIALLY THE MEN ON THE DISAGREEABLE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION, AND THERE'S WAY MORE MEN ON THE DISAGREEABLE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION THAN THERE ARE WOMEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000018	RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FROM, IF YOU LOOK AT OVERLAPPING NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS. SO, THERE'S THE MALE DISTRIBUTION, FEMALE DISTRIBUTION FOR AGREEABLENESS.
YOU1000000125_S0000019	MALE DISTRIBUTION FOR AGREEABLENESS. TREMENDOUS OVERLAP.
YOU1000000125_S0000021	OKAY, WOMEN ARE HIGHER. ALL THE REALLY AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WOMEN. ALL THE REALLY DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE MEN. AND MAYBE THE REAL DIFFERENCES OCCUR AT THE EXTREMES, RIGHT? SO...
YOU1000000125_S0000022	SO, AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SIDE EFFECT OF OVERLAPPING DISTRIBUTIONS. SO PEOPLE CAN BE MOSTLY THE SAME, BUT THAT CAN STILL PRODUCE RADICAL DIFFERENCES.
YOU1000000125_S0000024	DISAGREEABLE MEN WON'T DO ANYTHING THEY DON'T WANNA DO.
YOU1000000125_S0000026	THEY JUST SAY, UP YOURS. I'LL GO HOME AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES. I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOUR STUPID CLASSES. AND WHY SHOULD I WORK FOR YOU? I'LL JUST GO HAVE FUN.
YOU1000000125_S0000027	I'LL DO MY OWN THING. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MOTIVATED AND SO THEN IF YOU TAKE THE MEN WHO ARE LIKE THAT AND YOU SAY OKAY? WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOU1000000125_S0000029	YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. SO THEN THEY WRITE DOWN WHAT THEY WANT, AND THEY THINK, OH, HEY, WELL, THAT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING, SO MAYBE I'LL PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT.
YOU1000000125_S0000030	THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME. NOW, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WEAK EVIDENCE, AND THIS IS A WEAK ARGUMENT, BUT I'M TRYING TO STRETCH OUT MY UNDERSTANDING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS, BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.
YOU1000000125_S0000031	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS EITHER.
YOU1000000125_S0000033	MORE THAN 90% OF THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH MY VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ARE MEN. NOW THAT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE ABOUT 80% OF PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS ARE WOMEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000034	SO THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT, RIGHT? YOU'D EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD BE WOMEN. AND YOU MIGHT SAY, WELL, IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL STANCE I'VE TAKEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000035	AND I THOUGHT, WELL, THAT'S POSSIBLE. SO I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, BECAUSE I HAVE THAT. WELL, BEFORE I DID ANY OF THE POLITICAL VIDEOS, 85% OF MY VIEWERS WERE MEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000036	SO IT'S ACTUALLY INCREASED A BIT, IT'S INCREASED BY 6%, AND THAT'S NOT TRIVIAL, BUT IT WAS STILL OVERWHELMINGLY MEN
YOU1000000125_S0000037	SO THAT WAS INTERESTING, I THOUGHT, WHAT THE HELL, WHY IS THAT EXACTLY? AND THEN NOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING CROWDS WHEN I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM AND THE CROWDS THAT HAVE COME TO SEE ME IN PERSON
YOU1000000125_S0000038	THIS HAPPENED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO FREE SPEECH DEBATE, AND I ACTUALLY NOTICED IT AND COMMENTED ON IT BEFORE THE DEBATE TOOK PLACE, BECAUSE I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000039	AND I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND I THOUGHT, HMM, HEY, 80% OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE MEN SO I HAD ALL THE MEN STAND UP, WOMEN STAND UP, AND THEN ALL THE MEN STAND UP, I SAID, LOOK, LIKE
YOU1000000125_S0000040	HERE'S A NATURAL EXPERIMENT. FOR SOME REASON, 80% OF THE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP TO THIS ARE MEN. NOW, EVERYBODY THOUGHT I WAS KIND OF CRACKED TO DO THAT.
YOU1000000125_S0000041	AND IT WAS A RISK, YOU KNOW, BUT I THOUGHT, NO, THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE. AND THEN, WHAT'S INTERESTING NOW IS THAT EVERY PUBLIC APPEARANCE THAT I'VE MADE
YOU1000000125_S0000042	THAT'S RELATED TO THE SORT OF TOPICS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IS OVERWHELMINGLY MEN. IT'S LIKE 85 TO 90 PERCENT.
YOU1000000125_S0000043	AND SO I THOUGHT, WOW, THAT'S WEIRD, LIKE WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE EXACTLY? AND THEN THE OTHER THING I'VE NOTICED IS THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000044	I'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT TO THE CROWDS THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO NOT ABOUT RIGHTS, BUT ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY, RIGHT?
YOU1000000125_S0000045	BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE BLOODY CONVERSATION, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU CAN'T HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RIGHTS WITHOUT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE
YOU1000000125_S0000046	YOUR RIGHTS ARE MY RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE, TECHNICALLY. SO YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE ONLY HALF OF THAT DISCUSSION.
YOU1000000125_S0000047	AND WE'RE ONLY HAVING HALF THAT DISCUSSION. AND THE QUESTION IS, WELL, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LEAVING OUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE THAT HALF OF THE DISCUSSION?
YOU1000000125_S0000048	AND THE ANSWER IS, WELL, YOU'RE LEAVING OUT RESPONSIBILITY. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU LEAVING OUT IF YOU'RE LEAVING OUT RESPONSIBILITY? AND THE ANSWER MIGHT BE, WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE LEAVING OUT THE MEANING OF LIFE.
YOU1000000125_S0000050	THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME. IT'S LIKE, HERE YOU ARE, SUFFERING AWAY. WHAT MAKES IT WORTHWHILE? RIGHTS?
YOU1000000125_S0000051	YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMPLETELY OUT. YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE YOU IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE HOW BAD AN IDEA THAT IS
YOU1000000125_S0000053	RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU1000000125_S0000055	THAT'S WHAT GIVES LIFE MEANING. IT'S LIKE LIFT A LOAD. THEN YOU CAN TOLERATE YOURSELF, RIGHT? BECAUSE LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE USELESS. EASILY HURT.
YOU1000000125_S0000056	EASILY KILLED WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY SELF RESPECT? THAT'S THE STORY OF THE FALL PICK SOMETHING UP AND CARRY IT PICK MAKE IT HEAVY ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN THINK
YOU1000000125_S0000057	YEAH, WELL, USELESS AS I AM, AT LEAST I COULD MOVE THAT FROM THERE TO THERE. WELL, WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THAT IS THAT WHEN I TALK TO THESE CROWDS ABOUT THIS,
YOU1000000125_S0000058	THE MEN'S EYES LIGHT UP, AND THAT'S VERY... LIKE, I'VE SEEN THAT PHENOMENON, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MYTHOLOGICAL MATERIAL FOR A LONG TIME, AND I CAN SEE, WHEN I'M WATCHING CROWDS, PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THEIR EYEBROWS LIFT
YOU1000000125_S0000059	THEIR EYES LIGHT UP, BECAUSE I PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER FOR THEM. THAT'S WHAT MYTHOLOGICAL STORIES DO. SO I'M NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. THAT'S WHAT THE STORIES DO.
YOU1000000125_S0000060	SO I SAY THIS STORY, AND PEOPLE GO, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, YOU KNOW, AND THEIR EYES LIGHT UP. BUT THIS RESPONSIBILITY THING, THAT'S A WHOLE NEW ORDER OF THIS, IS THAT YOUNG MEN ARE SO HUNGRY FOR THAT.
YOU1000000125_S0000061	IT IS UNBELIEVABLE AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP IN CANADA, AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM ABOUT
YOU1000000125_S0000062	WELL, THE DIFFICULTIES THEY HAVE COMMUNICATING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE, BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES, WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY GONNA SELL TO YOUNG PEOPLE, RIGHT? BECAUSE BEING CONSERVATIVE IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE OLDER, THEY CAN SELL RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000064	NO ONE'S SELLING IT, AND THE THING IS, FOR MAN, THERE'S NOTHING BUT RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW, I WAS WATCHING THE SIMPSONS THE OTHER DAY, I WATCHED THE FIRST SIMPSONS EPISODE
YOU1000000125_S0000065	AND I DECONSTRUCTED IT.
YOU1000000125_S0000067	AND SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING, SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST SIMPSON EPISODE IS THAT IT'S CHRISTMAS, AND HOMER AND MARGE ARE GOING TO BUY SOME CHRISTMAS PRESENTS, BUT HOMER DOESN'T GET HIS CHRISTMAS BONUS
YOU1000000125_S0000068	AND SO HE'S ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED BY THAT, AND THAT ACTUALLY IS A RECURRING THEME IN THE SIMPSONS WHERE HOMER LOSES HIS JOB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OR CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY
YOU1000000125_S0000069	HE'S COMPLETELY CRUSHED, EVEN THOUGH HE'S KIND OF USELESS, BUMBLING, LAUGHING FOOL OF A GUY, YOU KNOW
YOU1000000125_S0000070	THE THING THAT GIVES THAT SHOW ITS SOUL IS THAT HE'S STILL ORIENTED TOWARDS HIS FAMILY, THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM HONORABLE, IS THAT FOOLISH AS HE IS,
YOU1000000125_S0000071	HE'S DECIDED TO ADOPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS FAMILY AND TO TRY TO BEAR THAT. AND SO HE'S NOT... HE'S A HOLY FOOL. HE'S NOT A COMPLETE FOOL.
YOU1000000125_S0000072	AND IT'S SO INTERESTING WATCHING THE STORY BECAUSE HE SUFFERS DREADFULLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FULFILL HIS RESPONSIBILITY. WELL, THAT'S FOR MEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000073	WOMEN HAVE THEIR SETS OF RESPONSIBILITIES. THEY'RE NOT THE SAME, RIGHT? BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPLICATED, BECAUSE WOMEN, OF COURSE, HAVE TO TAKE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000074	FOR HAVING INFANTS AT LEAST, BUT THEN ALSO FOR CARING FOR THEM. THEY'RE STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY THAN MEN.
YOU1000000125_S0000076	FOR BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY, EVEN IF IT'S NOT A PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE, AND IT'S ALSO PARTLY A PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE WOMEN KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO MEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO
YOU1000000125_S0000077	AND IF THEY HAVE NOTHING WORTH LIVING FOR, THEN THEY STAY PETER PAN.
YOU1000000125_S0000079	AND WHY THE HELL NOT?
YOU1000000125_S0000081	BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO VALUED RESPONSIBILITY IS
YOU1000000125_S0000083	IMPULSIVE, LOW CLASS PLEASURE. AND YOU SAW THAT IN THE PINOCCHIO STORY, RIGHT? THAT'S PLEASURE ISLAND. IT'S LIKE, WELL, WHY LIFT A LOAD IF THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR YOU?
YOU1000000125_S0000085	THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING TO MEN THAT'S A VERY BAD IDEA. AND TO BOYS.
YOU1000000125_S0000087	YOU'RE PATHOLOGICAL AND OPPRESSIVE, IT'S LIKE, FINE THEN, WHY THE HELL AM I GONNA PLAY? IF THAT'S THE SITUATION, IF I GET NO CREDIT FOR BEARING RESPONSIBILITY
YOU1000000125_S0000088	COULD BLOODY WELL BE SURE I'M NOT GOING TO BEAR ANY. BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, YOUR LIFE IS USELESS AND MEANINGLESS AND YOU'RE FULL OF SELF CONTEMPT AND NIHILISM AND...
YOU1000000125_S0000089	AND THAT'S NOT GOOD, AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK'S GOING ON AT A DEEPER LEVEL WITH REGARDS TO MEN NEEDING THIS DIRECTION
YOU1000000125_S0000090	A MAN HAS TO DECIDE THAT HE'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING. HE HAS TO DECIDE THAT.
YOU1000000125_S0000091	YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, PARTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE FUTURE AUTHORING PROCESS IS SAY, OKAY, WELL, WHAT'S YOUR HIGHEST VALUE? RIGHT, IT'S THE STAR. IT'S LIKE, OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU AIMING FOR?
YOU1000000125_S0000092	YOU CAN DECIDE, MAN, BUT YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME CRITERIA, IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU, IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES YOUR MOVING FORWARD
YOU1000000125_S0000093	MAYBE IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THE FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY, IT SHOULD COVER THE DOMAIN OF LIFE
YOU1000000125_S0000094	I MEAN, THERE'S CONSTRAINTS ON WHAT YOU SHOULD REGARD AS A VALUE, BUT WITHIN THOSE CONSTRAINTS YOU HAVE THE...
YOU1000000125_S0000096	CHOICE. YOU HAVE CHOICE. WELL, THE THING IS, IS THAT PEOPLE WILL CARRY A HEAVY LOAD IF THEY GET TO PICK THE GODDAMN LOAD.
YOU1000000125_S0000098	SO, AND THEY THINK, WELL, I WON'T CARRY ANY LOAD. IT'S LIKE, OKAY, FINE, BUT THEN YOU'RE LIKE THE SLED DOG THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SLED TO PULL. YOU'RE JUST GONNA...
YOU1000000125_S0000099	YOU'RE GONNA TEAR PIECES OUT OF YOUR OWN LEGS, BECAUSE YOU'RE BORED YOU KNOW, YOU NEED... PEOPLE ARE PACK ANIMALS, THEY NEED TO PULL AGAINST A WEIGHT
YOU1000000125_S0000100	AND THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERYONE, IT'S NOT TRUE PARTICULARLY, SAY, FOR LOW CONSCIENTIOUS PEOPLE I MEAN, MAYBE THEY'RE OPEN AND CREATIVE OR EXTROVERTED AND SOME OTHER THINGS
YOU1000000125_S0000101	BUT FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON.
YOU1000000125_S0000103	THEY'LL EAT THEMSELVES UP UNLESS THEY HAVE A LOAD. THIS IS WHY THERE'S SUCH AN OPIATE EPIDEMIC AMONG DISPOSSESSED WHITE MIDDLE AGED GUYS.
YOU1000000125_S0000104	WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED IN THE US. IT'S LIKE, THEY LOSE THEIR JOB, THEY'RE DONE.
YOU1000000125_S0000106	RIGHT? THEY DESPISE THEMSELVES. THEY DEVELOP CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROMES AND DEPRESSION. AND THE CHRONIC PAIN IS TREATED WITH OPIATES. IT'S LIKE, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. SO...
YOU1000000125_S0000107	YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME IS YOU YOU HAVE TO AND IT'S SO INTERESTING TO WATCH THE YOUNG MEN WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY THERE'S A GODDAMN THRILLED ABOUT IT
YOU1000000125_S0000108	IT JUST BLOWS ME AWAY. IT'S LIKE, REALLY?
YOU1000000125_S0000110	THAT'S THE COUNTERCULTURE.
YOU1000000125_S0000112	GROW THE HELL UP AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL. REALLY? I COULD DO THAT? OH, I'M SO EXCITED BY THAT IDEA. NO ONE EVER MENTIONED THAT BEFORE.
YOU1000000125_S0000113	IT'S LIKE, RIGHTS, RIGHTS, RIGHTS, RIGHTS, JESUS, IT'S APPALLING, AND I FEEL THAT THAT'S DEEPLY FELT BY THE PEOPLE
YOU1000000125_S0000114	WHO ARE COMING OUT TO LISTEN TO THESE SORTS OF THINGS TOO, THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT
YOU1000000125_S0000116	SO, AND THEY BETTER HAVE, BECAUSE IT'S A NON PRODUCTIVE MODE OF BEING. RESPONSIBILITY, MAN. THAT'S WHERE THE MEANING IN LIFE IS. SO...
YOU1000000126_S0000000	NOW IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE ANDREW NG, CO FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF COURSERA.
YOU1000000126_S0000001	HE'S AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR IN THE COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
YOU1000000126_S0000002	AND AS I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS IN 2011 HE LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANFORD'S MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSE PLATFORM, A MOOC.
YOU1000000126_S0000003	AND TAUGHT AN ONLINE MACHINE LEARNING CLASS THAT WAS OFFERED TO OVER 100,000 STUDENTS. THAT WAS THE INITIATIVE THAT LED TO THE CO FOUNDING OF COURSERA.
YOU1000000126_S0000004	HE WAS ALSO THE FOUNDING LEAD OF THE GOOGLE BRAIN TEAM, WHICH HELPED GOOGLE BECOME A LEADING AI COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE FORMER CHIEF SCIENTIST AT BEIDOU.
YOU1000000126_S0000006	WHERE HE LED THE COMPANY'S AI STRATEGY AND EXECUTION. HE'S AUTHORED OR CO AUTHORED 200 RESEARCH PAPERS IN MACHINE LEARNING, ROBOTICS AND RELATED FIELDS.
YOU1000000126_S0000007	IN 2013, HE WAS NAMED TO THE TIME 100 LIST OF MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE. HE HOLDS DEGREES FROM CARNEGIE MELLON, UNIVERSITY OF
YOU1000000126_S0000008	CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY, SORRY FOLKS, MIT AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY.
YOU1000000126_S0000009	AND PERHAPS WHAT'S THE MOST INTERESTING TO ME PERSONALLY ABOUT ANDREW IS THAT HE TEACHES 11 COURSERA COURSES.
YOU1000000126_S0000010	AND HE HAS TAUGHT OVER 3.4 MILLION LEARNERS. THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.
YOU1000000126_S0000011	WELCOME, ANDREW.
YOU1000000126_S0000013	THANKS A LOT, BETTY. AND THANKS, EVERYONE, FOR JOINING US AND FOR STICKING WITH US THROUGH THE END OF THIS CONFERENCE.
YOU1000000126_S0000014	I WAS BROWSING THROUGH THE ATTENDEES NAMES AND REGRETFUL THAT WE CAN'T BE HANGING OUT IN PERSON TOGETHER.
YOU1000000126_S0000015	BUT OF ALL THE, I'VE ATTENDED EVERY COURSERA POND THIS CONFERENCE SINCE THE FIRST ONE, AND THIS IS THE LARGEST ONE WE'VE EVER HELD. SO THAT'S A SILVER LINING.
YOU1000000126_S0000016	THAT. LET ME SHARE MY SLIDES.
YOU1000000126_S0000018	SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THIS.
YOU1000000126_S0000020	UM,
YOU1000000126_S0000022	LISTENING TO ALL OF THE PRESENTATIONS FROM EARLIER TODAY, I FEEL THAT
YOU1000000126_S0000024	BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF COVID,
YOU1000000126_S0000026	THERE IS NOT A FORK IN THE ROAD FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.
YOU1000000126_S0000028	SOCIETY IS TRYING OUT TO US TO HELP AND WE AS A COMMUNITY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE, MAYBE NOT EVERYONE, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE.
YOU1000000126_S0000030	AND THE CHOICES WE MAKE IN THIS COMMUNITY, IN HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY, THE CHOICES WE MAKE OVER THE NEXT YEAR WILL STAY WITH US FOR DECADES TO COME.
YOU1000000126_S0000032	THE ONLINE EDUCATION MOVEMENT HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR A DECADE OR MAYBE MANY DECADES.
YOU1000000126_S0000033	SOME OF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE STARTING OF COURSERA, WHERE WE HAD STARTED WITH TWO COURSES OUT OF STANFORD, THE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSES I TAUGHT AND THE DATABASES CLASS.
YOU1000000126_S0000034	TAUGHT BY MY FRIEND JENNIFER WIDOM.
YOU1000000126_S0000035	AND IN THE NOT QUITE DECADES SINCE THEN, THE NUMBER OF CAUSES HAS GROWN FROM TWO TO OVER 4000 ON COURSERA AND AN EVEN LARGER NUMBER WORLDWIDE.
YOU1000000126_S0000037	SO THIS HAS BEEN GROWING FOR A LONG TIME AND ALL OF YOU, OUR COMMUNITY, HAS BEEN LEARNING AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO TEACH ONLINE.
YOU1000000126_S0000039	UM,
YOU1000000126_S0000041	AND COVID IS ACCELERATING EVERYTHING.
YOU1000000126_S0000043	WE'RE SEEING HOW MANY WORKERS ARE HIT BY COVID, ESPECIALLY THE ONES WITHOUT A DEGREE.
YOU1000000126_S0000045	WE HAVE SEEN HOW MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING ONLINE COURSES TO HELP DEAL WITH SELF ISOLATION AND ALSO LEARN ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH.
YOU1000000126_S0000047	COVID IS ALSO CREATING UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. WASHINGTON POST, NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED COLLEGE STUDENTS REBELLING AGAINST FULL TUITION AFTER CLASSES MOVE ONLINE.
YOU1000000126_S0000048	I WAS GRATIFIED WHEN I HEARD MATTHEW IN THE PANEL JUST NOW TALK ABOUT ANNOUNCING LOWER PRICING FOR THIS SUMMER SESSION.
YOU1000000126_S0000049	SO MANY OF THE TRENDS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY ARE ACCELERATED BY COVID. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT SOCIETY IS HURTING.
YOU1000000126_S0000050	THE IMF ESTIMATES THAT THE WORLD WILL EXPERIENCE THE WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
YOU1000000126_S0000051	MOST OF US, MANY OF US THAT LIVE THROUGH THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2009, WHERE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SHRUNK BY 0.1%.
YOU1000000126_S0000052	THIS TIME AROUND, IT WILL SHRINK MUCH MORE BY IMF ESTIMATES. AND JUST IN THE US ALONE, 22 MILLION UNEMPLOYED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS.
YOU1000000126_S0000053	AND PEOPLE, PEOPLE ARE HURTING.
YOU1000000126_S0000055	WE HAVE A BIG ROLE TO PLAY TO HELP MANY OF THESE PEOPLE.
YOU1000000126_S0000057	DONE
YOU1000000126_S0000059	COMPOUNDING TREND ON TREND, TRUST IN EXPERTISE AND TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS HAS ALSO BEEN GOING DOWN, NOT JUST FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS, BUT FOR MANY YEARS NOW.
YOU1000000126_S0000060	EDELMAN CARRIES OUT A LARGE ANNUAL, VERY LARGE MULTI CITY SURVEY CALLED THE EDELMAN TRUST BAROMETER.
YOU1000000126_S0000061	AND IN ONE OF THE RECENT STUDIES, THEY PLOT
YOU1000000126_S0000064	DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS ACCORDING TO HOW COMPETENT THEY ARE VIEWED AND HOW ETHICAL THEY ARE VIEWED.
YOU1000000126_S0000065	SO THE HORIZONTAL AXIS IS HOW COMPETENT IS AN INSTITUTION, VERTICAL AXIS IS HOW ETHICAL IS AN INSTITUTION.
YOU1000000126_S0000066	AND BUSINESSES ARE VIEWED AS QUITE COMPETENT, BUT NOT ALWAYS THE MOST ETHICAL ON AVERAGE.
YOU1000000126_S0000067	NGOS, NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS, A VIEW THAT'S RELATIVELY ETHICAL BUT NOT AS COMPETENT.
YOU1000000126_S0000068	AND GOVERNMENT MEDIA ARE PERCEIVED BY CITIZENS ALL AROUND THE WORLD AS NEITHER NECESSARILY COMPETENT NOR ETHICAL.
YOU1000000126_S0000069	I'M NOT SAYING THAT ANY OF THESE PERCEPTIONS ARE FAIR. I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF HIGHLY COMPETENT AND HIGHLY ETHICAL INDIVIDUALS IN ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS.
YOU1000000126_S0000070	BUT THERE'S A PERCEPTION OF A LARGE SWATH OF SOCIETY AND WE HAVE A LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED
YOU1000000126_S0000071	FAIRLY OR UNFAIRLY, BUT LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BROADLY PERCEIVED AS BOTH HIGHLY COMPETENT AND HIGHLY ETHICAL.
YOU1000000126_S0000072	I WOULD QUITE LIKE FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS OF EDUCATION, OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THAT ROLE.
YOU1000000126_S0000073	THIS TRUST PARAMETER DID NOT HAVE A NOTE SPECIFICALLY ON HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT WE'VE ALL SEEN THE TRENDS AS EDUCATORS FOR MANY YEARS NOW.
YOU1000000126_S0000075	AND SO MAYBE IT'S NO SURPRISE, THEREFORE, THAT WITH THE RISE OF COVID, WITH ALL OF THESE IMPACTS, HIGHER EDUCATION IS IN CRISIS.
YOU1000000126_S0000076	YOU'VE SEEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW RECENT PERIOD OF TIME, ARTICLES WITH TITLES LIKE CRISIS IN HIGHER EDUCATION OR IN MY HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA, CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION CRISIS.
YOU1000000126_S0000077	OR PRESIDENT OF HIGHER AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION AND SO ON, ON AND ON AND ON. WE'RE SEEING ARTICLES LIKE THESE.
YOU1000000126_S0000078	OH, AND DID I SAY THAT THIS WAS CREATED BY THE COVID CRISIS? ACTUALLY, THESE ARTICLES THAT WERE PUBLISHED ARE WELL BEFORE THE COVID CRISIS.
YOU1000000126_S0000079	SO IT'S STRANGE AND INTERESTING THAT THE FIELD OF HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN IN CRISIS FOR ABOUT A DECADE NOW.
YOU1000000126_S0000080	I THINK COVID IS ACCELERATING THIS CRISIS, BUT IF WE WERE ALREADY IN THIS STATE, EVEN BEFORE THE RECENT PANDEMIC,
YOU1000000126_S0000081	I THINK THIS IS EVEN MORE TRUE NOW. YOU KNOW, THERE IS, I'M PROUD TO BE AN EDUCATOR, EXCITED ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE, VERY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION.
YOU1000000126_S0000082	BUT I WOULD QUITE LIKE TO DO SOMETHING SO THAT MAYBE BY THE YEAR 2025, MAYBE WE CAN ALL WORK REALLY HARD FOR A FEW YEARS AND NOT BE IN CRISIS.
YOU1000000126_S0000083	OR ANY MORE A FEW YEARS FROM NOW. IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE HEALTHIEST DAY FOR OUR INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO HAPPEN IN CRISIS FOR SO LONG.
YOU1000000126_S0000084	BUT TO ME I THINK THIS POPULAR REFLECTION OF OF THE STATE OF CRISIS IS IS MAYBE A SIGN THAT
YOU1000000126_S0000085	DESPITE ALL THE VERY POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE HAVE AND WE'RE STRIVING TO MAKE, THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR US TO DO EVEN BETTER.
YOU1000000126_S0000087	ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT MOVED ME THE MOST IS THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
YOU1000000126_S0000088	I FIRST READ THIS DOCUMENT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT STANFORD AND IT REALLY MOVED ME THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS.
YOU1000000126_S0000089	BUT QUOTING FROM ARTICLE 26, IT SAYS, WE AS A SOCIETY DECLARED IN 1948
YOU1000000126_S0000090	THAT WAS THE YEAR MY FATHER WAS BORN, 72 YEARS AGO.
YOU1000000126_S0000091	WHERE SOCIETY DECIDED THAT EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION.
YOU1000000126_S0000092	EDUCATION SHOULD BE FREE AT THIS ELEMENTARY AND FUNDAMENTAL STAGES, TECH AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE,
YOU1000000126_S0000093	AND HIGHER EDUCATION SHALL BE EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL ON THE BASIS OF MERIT.
YOU1000000126_S0000094	SADLY, DESPITE THIS PROUD DECLARATION, THIS BEAUTIFUL DECLARATION THAT WE MADE AS A SOCIETY 72 YEARS AGO,
YOU1000000126_S0000095	THIS STILL ISN'T THE REALITY WE LIVE IN TODAY.
YOU1000000126_S0000096	EDUCATION IS LIMITED BY GEOGRAPHY, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LIMITATIONS, AND POLITICAL RESTRICTIONS.
YOU1000000126_S0000097	THESE RESTRICTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MAKING IT HARD FOR STUDENTS TO GET AN EDUCATION AND IT'S BECOME EVEN HARDER JUST IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.
YOU1000000126_S0000098	JUST LAST NIGHT, THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT TWEETED OUT ABOUT SUSPENDING IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000126_S0000099	AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WILL AFFECT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OR ARE COUNTING ON MAYBE COMING TO THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000126_S0000100	FOR THEIR STUDIES.
YOU1000000126_S0000101	AND EVEN SIMONE, OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, SIMONE FROM IMPERIAL, ON THE PANEL MENTIONED JUST NOW, PEOPLE ARE FINALLY ON BOARD TO GET TO LONDON.
YOU1000000126_S0000102	THIS IS TRUE NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE UK, BUT ALL AROUND THE WORLD. AND COVID IS ACCELERATING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS LIKE CRAZY.
YOU1000000126_S0000103	I THINK IT'S UP TO ALL OF US TO USE THE DIGITAL REALM TO MAKE SURE THAT EDUCATION BECOMES MORE RATHER THAN LESS ACCESSIBLE.
YOU1000000126_S0000105	NOW, AMIDST ALL OF THIS DOOM AND GLOOM, AMIDST ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES WE FACE, THERE IS A MASSIVE SILVER LINING.
YOU1000000126_S0000106	I THINK SILVER LINING IS THAT THIS GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF THE VIRTUAL WORLD OF ONLINE EDUCATION.
YOU1000000126_S0000107	AND WE'RE ALSO REALLY LUCKY THAT WE WORK IN AN INDUSTRY SECTOR THAT IN EDUCATION, A LOT OF OUR WORK CAN MOVE ONLINE.
YOU1000000126_S0000108	NOT ALL OF IT, NOT EASILY, BUT A LOT OF OUR WORK CAN MOVE ONLINE.
YOU1000000126_S0000109	SO AS AN EDUCATOR, I FEEL A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR US TO LEAD THIS CHANGE AND TO PLAY THE ROLE THAT ALL OF US
YOU1000000126_S0000111	THAT ALL OF YOU CAN PLAY TO HELP THE REST OF SOCIETY.
YOU1000000126_S0000113	AND PART OF THE SILVER LINING IS THAT EVEN WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD,
YOU1000000126_S0000114	I SEE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL EMPOWERED, DESPITE THE UNEMPLOYMENT, DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU1000000126_S0000115	PEOPLE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WANTING TO HAVE PRODUCTIVE QUARANTINE MORNINGS AND AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS.
YOU1000000126_S0000117	JEFF SHOWED THIS PICTURE OF A RAPID RISE IN NEW USER ENROLLMENTS. AND THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM TREND THAT WILL BE OVER WHEN COVID DIES DOWN.
YOU1000000126_S0000118	THIS GROWTH IN ONLINE EDUCATION HAS BEEN A LONG TERM TREND, BUT ONLY ACCELERATED BY COVID.
YOU1000000126_S0000119	AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WITH THESE MILLIONS OF LEARNERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD LEARNING NEW HABITS, THEY'RE TEACHING THEMSELVES HOW TO LEARN ONLINE.
YOU1000000126_S0000120	I FEEL LIKE AS AN INSTRUCTOR, I'VE BEEN TEACHING MY STANFORD CLASSES ONLINE VIA ZOOM.
YOU1000000126_S0000121	AND JUST AS I HAD TO LEARN NEW SKILLS, OUR STUDENTS, OUR LEARNERS, ARE HAVING TO LEARN NEW SKILLS TO SUCCEED IN LEARNING ONLINE.
YOU1000000126_S0000122	AND HOPEFULLY MORE COUNTRIES WILL EMERGE FROM LOCKDOWN SOON, BUT EVEN WHEN WE ALL REOPEN OUR CAMPUSES,
YOU1000000126_S0000123	WHEN SOCIAL DISTANCING CAN BE RELAXED.
YOU1000000126_S0000124	THE SKILLS THAT THESE MILLIONS OR TENS OF MILLIONS, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ONLINE LEARNERS ARE LEARNING RIGHT NOW, THEY WON'T FORGET THESE SKILLS.
YOU1000000126_S0000125	AND THIS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO KEEP ON USING THE DIGITAL MEDIUM TO KEEP ON SERVING THEM EVEN AFTER COVID IS OVER.
YOU1000000126_S0000127	I LIKE THIS QUOTE BY ONE OF THE PARTNERS AT IDEO WHO SAID THAT THE VIRUS SEEMS LIKE AN ACCELERATOR FOR DIGITAL CHANGE THAT WAS ALREADY UNDERWAY.
YOU1000000126_S0000128	AND THAT THIS DIGITAL MINDSET WILL PERSIST AND IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT COMPANIES OR UNIVERSITIES OR STUDENTS WILL TRY TO RETURN TO WHAT WORKED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC.
YOU1000000126_S0000129	PATRICK BROTHERS DURING THE PANEL ALSO SAID THAT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN, WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS,
YOU1000000126_S0000130	WILL NOW MAYBE HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.
YOU1000000126_S0000131	AND WITH ALL THIS CHANGE, I FEEL LIKE DIGITAL PEDAGOGY IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY.
YOU1000000126_S0000132	I HAVE BEEN TEACHING ONLINE FOR A LONG TIME, RUNNING LITTLE EXPERIMENTS, MANY OF WHICH WENT NOWHERE.
YOU1000000126_S0000133	EVEN TODAY, I FEEL THAT ONLINE PEDAGOGY, THE WAY WE TEACH ONLINE INTERACTIVE LEARNERS, IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY.
YOU1000000126_S0000134	I'VE BEEN TEACHING MY ON CAMPUS, I GUESS MY STANFORD CLASS USING FLIP CLASSROOM FOR MANY YEARS NOW.
YOU1000000126_S0000135	WITH ONLINE DIGITAL CONTENT, AUTO GRADING, AND RECENTLY, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, HAD TO MOVE THE LIVE PORTION OF THAT CLASS TO ZOOM.
YOU1000000126_S0000136	AND I'VE REALLY ENJOYED AND ON ONE HAND, I MISSED THE DEEPER, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH LEARNERS.
YOU1000000126_S0000137	AND SEEING PEOPLE IN 3D AND GETTING TO SHAKE THEIR HANDS OFF THE GLASS.
YOU1000000126_S0000138	ON THE FLIP SIDE, I REALLY ENJOY INTERACTING WITH MY STUDENTS IN REAL TIME VIA CHAT.
YOU1000000126_S0000139	PREVIOUSLY WHEN I ASKED A QUESTION IN CLASS, ONE PERSON WOULD GET TO ANSWER.
YOU1000000126_S0000140	NOW I ROUTINELY ASK QUESTIONS IN ZOOM CHAT AND ASK EVERY SINGLE STUDENT IN THE CLASS TO ANSWER.
YOU1000000126_S0000141	AND I REALLY LIKE THAT EVERYONE IN MY CLASSROOM, DIGITAL CLASSROOM, NOW GETS TO PARTICIPATE.
YOU1000000126_S0000143	AND EVEN THOUGH THE WORLD'S BEEN DOING BEEN PARTICIPATING IN ONLINE EDUCATION FOR A LONG TIME, YOU KNOW,
YOU1000000126_S0000144	EIGHT YEARS, OF COURSE THERE ARE MAYBE MANY DECADES AS A SOCIETY, THERE IS STILL SO MUCH MORE WE CAN DO.
YOU1000000126_S0000145	YOU HEARD KEN TALK ABOUT PEER GRADING USING MACHINE LEARNING.
YOU1000000126_S0000146	I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE COURSERA LABS FOR PROJECT GUIDED PROJECT WORK FEATURES THAT NAMIT TALKED ABOUT, SHAVIN AND TALKED ABOUT MANY NEW PRODUCT FEATURES.
YOU1000000126_S0000147	AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHERE ONLINE EDUCATION IS NOW AND HOW MUCH BETTER WE CAN MAKE THE EXPERIENCE STILL IN THE FUTURE,
YOU1000000126_S0000148	I THINK THERE IS STILL SO MUCH TO DO AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL LOOK BACK AT THIS INCREDIBLY RUDIMENTARY THINGS WE'RE DOING BACK IN 2020 AND SAY,
YOU1000000126_S0000149	WOW, THOSE THINGS WE THOUGHT WERE SO ADVANCED IN 2020, BOY, THAT WAS SO ANCIENT AND SO ARCHAIC.
YOU1000000126_S0000150	AND WE CAN DELIVER SUCH A BETTER EXPERIENCE TO OUR LEARNER RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000126_S0000152	AND, YOU KNOW, I SAW, WE SAW A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ABOUT THE SHORTAGE OF JIGSAW PUZZLES, RIGHT.
YOU1000000126_S0000153	BECAUSE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING, THE WORLD DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH JIGSAW PUZZLES. MAKING NEW JIGSAW PUZZLES IS REALLY HARD.
YOU1000000126_S0000154	BUT THE NICE THING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TEACHING ONLINE IS
YOU1000000126_S0000155	IF WE HAD DIGITAL PUZZLES, THE SOFTWARE APPS, THE DIGITAL PUZZLES, THAT CAN BE REPLICATED AT SCALE VERY QUICKLY.
YOU1000000126_S0000156	DIGITAL INNOVATION IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AS WE INNOVATE, AS WE COME UP WITH NEW FORMS OF PEDAGOGY, OUR COMMUNITY, ALL OF YOU, THE TEACHERS REPRESENTED HERE,
YOU1000000126_S0000157	WE CAN QUICKLY TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND REPLICATE THAT TO LEARNERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE THE DIGITAL MEDIUM IS EASY TO SCALE UP.
YOU1000000126_S0000159	SO WITH ALL OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND WITH ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES,
YOU1000000126_S0000161	I THINK WE COME BACK TO THIS FORK IN THE ROAD.
YOU1000000126_S0000163	WE DO FACE SIGNIFICANT, THE WORLD FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES.
YOU1000000126_S0000164	TED TALKED ABOUT UNIVERSITIES MAYBE AT A HIGHER RISK OF CLOSURE.
YOU1000000126_S0000165	THE CHALLENGES THAT SOCIETY FACED AND THE CHALLENGES THAT ALL OF US IN HIGHER EDUCATION FACE IS CREATING A FORK IN THE ROAD.
YOU1000000126_S0000166	WHERE ON ONE HAND, WE COULD KEEP ON DOING BUSINESSES AS USUAL.
YOU1000000126_S0000167	AND MAYBE SOME INSTITUTIONS WILL BE OKAY. WE DO HAVE VERY ROBUST, SOME VERY ROBUST INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION.
YOU1000000126_S0000168	AND AND MAYBE WE COULD HAVE INSTRUCTORS TEACH ON ZOOM BUT KEEP A LOT OF THINGS THE SAME AND MAYBE IT MAYBE SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS WILL DO OKAY
YOU1000000126_S0000170	BUT I HOPE THAT ALL OF US WILL STEP UP AND RETHINK HOW WE CAN BEST BE HOPEFUL TO THE WORLD BECAUSE
YOU1000000126_S0000172	WITH SOCIETY IN CRISIS, WITH SOCIETY REACHING OUT TO US FOR HELP, WITH UNEMPLOYED LEARNERS, WITH PEOPLE NEEDING HELP.
YOU1000000126_S0000173	I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT
YOU1000000126_S0000174	AS LEADERS IN EDUCATION TO STEP UP AND RETHINK HOW WE CAN HELP THE WORLD.
YOU1000000126_S0000176	I THINK THIS MAY BE A MOMENT THAT IF WE AS A COMMUNITY, NO ONE OF US ALONE CAN DO THIS,
YOU1000000126_S0000177	BUT THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY CAN RETHINK HOW WE CAN USE DIGITAL TOOLS TO SERVE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE NEWLY WILLING TO ACCEPT DIGITAL LEARNING.
YOU1000000126_S0000178	THEN THE OPPORTUNITY IS GREATER THAN EVER. AND I HOPE WE CAN BUILD A WORLD, BRIDGE A WORLD ACROSS TIME ZONES.
YOU1000000126_S0000179	AND BUILD A WORLD WHERE YOUR EDUCATION DOESN'T NEED A PASSPORT.
YOU1000000126_S0000181	LIKE MOST WORTHWHILE ENDEAVORS, THIS WILL BE HARD WORK, BUT EVERY DAY I REMAIN GRATEFUL TO ALL OF YOU
YOU1000000126_S0000182	TO COURSERA'S PARTNERS, STUDENTS, ON MOVING FORWARD TO BUILD THIS WORLD.
YOU1000000126_S0000183	WHERE ANYONE IN THE WORLD CAN GET ACCESS TO A GREAT EDUCATION.
YOU1000000126_S0000184	AND I'D LIKE TO CLOSE JUST BY THANKING ALL OF YOU AGAIN.
YOU1000000126_S0000185	WHEN WE STARTED COURSERA, WE HAD NO IDEA THAT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IT WOULD BLOSSOM TO SUCH A LARGE MOVEMENT.
YOU1000000126_S0000186	AND I AM UNDER NO ILLUSIONS THAT THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE BUT FOR THE HARD WORK OF ALL OF YOU, OF ALL OF OUR UNIVERSITY PARTNERS.
YOU1000000126_S0000187	AND EVERY YEAR, EDUCATION HAS BEEN IN CRISIS.
YOU1000000126_S0000188	BUT IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME, THE WORLD NEEDS ALL OF US. THE WORLD NEEDS ALL OF YOU MORE THAN EVER. AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF US WILL KEEP ON WORKING HARD.
YOU1000000126_S0000189	AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THESE DIGITAL TOOLS TO SERVE LEARNERS WORLDWIDE WHEN THEY NEED US MORE THAN EVER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU1000000126_S0000191	THANK YOU, ANDREW.
YOU1000000127_S0000001	HEAT AND DROUGHT.
YOU1000000127_S0000003	RAINFALL THAT'S GROWN UNPREDICTABLE.
YOU1000000127_S0000005	STORMS OF CATASTROPHIC POWER.
YOU1000000127_S0000007	AND RISING SEA LEVELS.
YOU1000000127_S0000009	THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON HUMANITY.
YOU1000000127_S0000011	THE AGREEMENT EMPHASIZES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE REPRESENTS AN URGENT AND POTENTIALLY IRREVERSIBLE THREAT TO HUMAN SOCIETIES AND THE PLANET.
YOU1000000127_S0000013	AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE, AFRICA IS THE CONTINENT THAT WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU1000000127_S0000014	YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE DATA WE HAVE 8.9 MILLION IDPS.
YOU1000000127_S0000015	AND 3.9 MILLION REFUGEES IN 2019 WITHOUT FULLY COUNTING 2020, WHICH IS A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR.
YOU1000000127_S0000016	THAT WE HAVE CHALLENGED AS HUMANITY THAT DEFINITELY THE IMPACT OF COVID HAVE IN ALL POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND IN OUR SOCIAL ASPECTS.
YOU1000000127_S0000017	CLIMATE CHANGE IS HITTING AFRICA HARDEST OF ALL, ALTHOUGH THE CONTINENT HAS CONTRIBUTED LEAST TO THE CRISIS.
YOU1000000127_S0000019	CROPS ARE ROTTING IN FIELDS.
YOU1000000127_S0000021	HERDERS CAN NO LONGER FIND WATER FOR THEIR ANIMALS.
YOU1000000127_S0000023	AND THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC COULD SOON DRIVE ANOTHER 40 MILLION PEOPLE IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA INTO EXTREME POVERTY.
YOU1000000127_S0000025	SO PEOPLE'S BECOMING HOMELESS FROM THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND THE CONFLICT AMONG THE COMMUNITIES IS TOUGH. SO THAT'S THE ONE WHO LEAD TO THE MIGRATIONS.
YOU1000000127_S0000026	WE ARE TALKING MAYBE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MIGRATIONS, WHERE THERE ARE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLES KILLING THEMSELVES INTO MEDITERRANEAN STUDENTS IN THE YEAR.
YOU1000000127_S0000027	BUT THERE ARE HUGE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLES WHO ARE INTERNALLY DISPLACED, WHO HAVE TO MOVE FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER ONE.
YOU1000000127_S0000028	AND THAT CREATES THE CONFLICT AMONG THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE TO SHARE THE RESOURCES.
YOU1000000127_S0000029	HOW CAN WE PROTECT AND SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE DISPLACED?
YOU1000000127_S0000031	NOW WHAT THE MODEL DOES IS THAT IT HAS NOW MUCH MORE GRANULAR DATA ON POPULATION EXPOSURE, WHICH GIVES A CLEARER SENSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE DISPLACED BY FUTURE RIVERINE FLOODS.
YOU1000000127_S0000032	AND IT ESTIMATES THAT ON AVERAGE, WE CAN EXPECT 2.8 MILLION PEOPLE TO BE DISPLACED BY SUCH FLOODS IN AFRICA DURING ANY GIVEN YEAR IN THE FUTURE.
YOU1000000127_S0000033	THE ARCTIC TEMPERATURE IS MORE THAN 7 DEGREES HIGHER THAN IT WAS 100 YEARS AGO.
YOU1000000127_S0000034	THIS HAS VAST IMPLICATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, FLOODS, TROPICAL STORMS, DROUGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU1000000127_S0000035	THIS SHOWS CLIMATE CHANGE IS FAR MORE THAN AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE.
YOU1000000127_S0000036	IT HAS CRUCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY, FOR PEACE AND STABILITY, FOR SECURITY AND MIGRATION POLICY.
YOU1000000127_S0000037	IT HAS THEREFORE BECOME ONE OF THE DETERMINING FACTORS OF FOREIGN POLICY AT LARGE.
YOU1000000127_S0000038	THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, NOT LOST IN AFRICA.
YOU1000000127_S0000039	WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE APARTHEID RIGHT NOW. SO IN THE SENSE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING THE FIRST AND MOST BRUTAL PRICE
YOU1000000127_S0000040	LOOK IN A PARTICULAR COLOUR AND THOSE THAT HISTORICALLY CARRY THE BIGGEST WEIGHT OF THE... SO
YOU1000000127_S0000041	WE OFTEN WONDER WHETHER IN FACT THE URGENCY WOULD BE MUCH MORE IF THERE WERE MORE URGENT
YOU1000000127_S0000042	IMMEDIATE IMPACTS HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND SO ON.
YOU1000000127_S0000043	NOW THAT'S A VERY NEGATIVE STATEMENT TO START WITH, BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU WHY I'M...
YOU1000000127_S0000044	BASICALLY, THIS IS NO TIME FOR US TO BE BEING.
YOU1000000127_S0000045	PALLY PALLY WITH EACH OTHER AND NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST AND NOT ACTUALLY GETTING
YOU1000000127_S0000046	ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER. WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
YOU1000000127_S0000047	DEVELOPMENT IS BEING UNDERMINED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE CANNOT IGNORE IT AND WE MUST ADDRESS IT AND WE MUST ADDRESS IT UP FRONT.
YOU1000000127_S0000048	I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE ALSO TO STOP SEEING MIGRATION JUST NEGATIVELY.
YOU1000000127_S0000049	AND THIS IS A KEY MESSAGE FROM MY SIDE. I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK ALSO AT MIGRATION AS A PART OF THE SOLUTION.
YOU1000000127_S0000050	MOST OF THE TIME WE TALK BASICALLY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES, THE CAUSE FOR MIGRATION, AND WE FRAME IT AS A PROBLEM.
YOU1000000127_S0000051	AND WE RARELY LOOK AT THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY, AS AN ADAPTATION STRATEGY.
YOU1000000127_S0000052	THE EUROPEAN IN AFRICA IS AN EXPAT AND THE AFRICAN IN EUROPE IS A MIGRANT. IT CAN CONTINUE LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000127_S0000054	AUTHORITIES IN FREETOWN HAVE NOW DETERMINED TO PLANT A MILLION TREES BY 2022.
YOU1000000127_S0000056	AND INCREASE VEGETATION IN THE CITY BY 50%.
YOU1000000127_S0000058	THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP PROTECT RESIDENTS IN THE FUTURE, BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU1000000127_S0000060	IN ADDITION TO THESE COMMITMENTS AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AFRICA, THERE IS NEED
YOU1000000127_S0000062	TO FOCUS ON BUILDING RESILIENT SOCIETIES IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN ADAPT IN PLACE AND PROSPER.
YOU1000000127_S0000063	SO THAT THERE ISN'T NEED FOR CONTINUOUS MIGRATION IN THIS REGARD.
YOU1000000127_S0000064	ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU1000000127_S0000065	YOU CANNOT HAVE CLIMATE RESILIENCE WITHOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH, WEALTH CREATION AND MASSIVE JOB EXPANSION.
YOU1000000127_S0000066	AND ENERGY, OF COURSE, IS TIED TO EVERYTHING. YOU NEED ENERGY FOR THE CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION IN THE CITY.
YOU1000000127_S0000067	YOU NEED ENERGY FOR THE LIGHTING TO DRIVE THE INDUSTRIES THAT WILL CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND GROWTH.
YOU1000000127_S0000069	SO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THAT NEXUS BETWEEN ENERGY, WATER AND SANITATION, ENERGY AND HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY.
YOU1000000127_S0000070	THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR URBAN PLANNING, URBAN POLICY, WHICH IS ALIGNED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT.
YOU1000000127_S0000071	AND HOUSING STOCK, RECOGNIZING THIS PHENOMENON OF URBANIZATION IS HERE TO STAY.
YOU1000000127_S0000072	IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE, YOU NEED TO PLAN TO RECEIVE THEM. YOU NEED TO PLAN TO DELIVER SERVICES.
YOU1000000127_S0000073	I THINK THE CONTINENT NEEDS TO CLARIFY, TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ON WHERE IT WANTS TO GO, WHAT IT NEEDS AND HOW TO DO IT.
YOU1000000127_S0000074	IT HAS TO BE NOT ONLY A TOP DOWN APPROACH BUT ALSO A BOTTOM UP APPROACH FULLY INFORMED BY THOSE NEEDS.
YOU1000000127_S0000075	SHOULD EUROPE TURN INTO EVEN MORE OF A FORTRESS?
YOU1000000127_S0000077	OR SHOULD IT INSTEAD LOOK FOR MORE WAYS TO MAKE LEGAL MIGRATION FROM AFRICA POSSIBLE?
YOU1000000127_S0000079	CLIMATE CHANGE IS A COMMON THREAT TO ALL OF US. NO COUNTRY CAN WITHDRAW FROM THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING.
YOU1000000127_S0000080	PEOPLE LOSE THEIR ENTIRE EXISTENCE BECAUSE OF DISASTERS. THE POLITICAL STABILITY OF WHOLE REGIONS IS AT STAKE.
YOU1000000127_S0000081	TO WORK TOGETHER TO EASE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS THEREFORE A QUESTION OF HUMANITY, BUT ALSO OF POLITICAL RATIONALITY.
YOU1000000127_S0000082	THIS STRATEGY IS ABOUT THE EU AND AFRICA JOINING FORCES IN A SOLID, EQUAL PARTNERSHIP
YOU1000000127_S0000083	TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE GREEN AND THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION.
YOU1000000127_S0000085	TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE DECENT JOBS, GOOD LIVELIHOODS, WHILE ALSO TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU1000000127_S0000086	HOW CAN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COME TOGETHER TO FACE THE IMMENSE CHALLENGES AHEAD?
YOU1000000127_S0000088	FOR
YOU1000000127_S0000089	ACTUALLY REFLECT THE REALITIES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR, BUT IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE REALITY OF TODAY.
YOU1000000127_S0000090	WE HAVE TO WORK NOT EUROCENTRIC, BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH LIKE MINDED COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE TO SEE TO IT
YOU1000000127_S0000091	THAT THE RULES BASED INTERNATIONAL ORDER IS OBSERVED. THIS CANNOT BE JUST DONE BY ONE COUNTRY, BY ONE PERSON.
YOU1000000127_S0000092	NEVER LET A CRISIS GO TO WASTE. THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON WHERE WE CAN SEE HOW TO INDEED BETWEEN EUROPE AND AFRICA WORK TOGETHER
YOU1000000127_S0000093	TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY SHARING BEST PRACTICES, BY SHARING EXPERIENCES AND BY LOOKING AT POTENTIAL PROSPECTS.
YOU1000000127_S0000094	I THINK THAT GERMANY HAS TO DO MORE. THIS IS EXACTLY MY EXPECTATION.
YOU1000000127_S0000095	AND I'M CONVINCED THAT CLIMATE INDUCED MIGRATION IS AN ISSUE THAT URGENTLY NEEDS OPEN DIALOGUE.
YOU1000000127_S0000096	BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND MULTILATERAL PLATFORMS TO CREATE SAFE PATHWAYS FOR MIGRATION
YOU1000000127_S0000097	TO CREATE A STATUS THAT PROTECTS THOSE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BECOME STATELESS.
YOU1000000127_S0000098	THE ONLY FAILURE IS TO GIVE UP. IT'S DOABLE. WE CAN DO IT. IT WAS DONE BEFORE.
YOU1000000127_S0000099	THE KEY HERE IS TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY, TO DO IT WITH CREATIVITY AND TO ENSURE THE NEEDED COMMITMENT.
YOU1000000127_S0000100	IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD PUT BACK PEOPLE AT THE HEART OF THE CLIMATE ACTION.
YOU1000000127_S0000101	WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONTINENT, A MOBILE CONTINENT IS A HEALTHY CONTINENT.
YOU1000000127_S0000102	WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILITY, A MOBILE CONTINENT IS A RESOURCEFUL CONTINENT.
YOU1000000127_S0000103	WE ALWAYS SAY NATURE IS EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE NATURE IS THE ONE WHO ARE GIVING US FOOD, GIVING US MEDICINE, EVEN THE MEDICINE IN THE PHARMACY.
YOU1000000127_S0000104	70% OF IT COMING FROM THE NATURE AND THEN MAYBE 30% FROM THE CHEMICAL.
YOU1000000127_S0000105	THINGS THAT THEY ARE ADDING ON IT, BUT THE EXPRESSIONS AND ALL THE SUBSTANCE ARE COMING FROM NATURE.
YOU1000000127_S0000107	AND FOOD ARE COMING FROM NATURE. WE HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FROM NOW TO THE NEXT NINE YEARS OR 10 YEARS.
YOU1000000127_S0000108	TO INCREASE ALL THE AMBITIONS AND ACT NOW. IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT, WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS, NOT A TURN POINT.
YOU1000000127_S0000110	IT'S TIME TO ACT.
YOU1000000128_S0000003	GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. IT IS LOVELY TO BE BACK. MY NAME IS MABEL VAN ORANJE AND AS YOU MIGHT KNOW, I'M A FORMER CO CHAIR OF ECFR AND I AM CURRENTLY A CHAIR EMERITUS.
YOU1000000128_S0000004	AND I'M REALLY, REALLY EXCITED TO FACILITATE THIS CONVERSATION WITH GEORGE SOROS, WHO, AS YOU ALL KNOW, IS THE MAN WHO PLAYED AN ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE CREATION OF ECFR.
YOU1000000128_S0000005	AND BEFORE I HAND THE FLOOR TO HIM, I WANTED TO JUST MAYBE DRAW ATTENTION TO ONE OR TWO OF THE FEATURES THAT I FIND SO AMAZING OF GEORGE.
YOU1000000128_S0000006	BECAUSE GEORGE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS ALWAYS AHEAD OF THE CURVE. HE OFTEN SEES THINGS LONG BEFORE THE GENERAL PUBLIC ACTUALLY REALIZES THAT THEY'RE HAPPENING.
YOU1000000128_S0000007	AND I AM THINKING FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 2008. HE SAW IT COMING BEFORE IT EVEN HIT.
YOU1000000128_S0000008	BUT ALSO I'M THINKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT HAS REALLY BEEN CLOSE TO HIS HEART FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS NOW, I THINK, WHICH IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000128_S0000009	AND HE'S BEEN WORKING FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS ON THIS. AND IT IS REALLY GOOD TO SEE THAT THAT IS FINALLY GETTING MUCH MORE ATTENTION AS IT REALLY DESERVES.
YOU1000000128_S0000011	LET US GET US CLOSER TO HOME, LET US GET US TO EUROPE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN GEORGE DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN EUROPE IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO REALLY CORRECTS AND THAT IS STANDING UP FOR THE UNDERDOG.
YOU1000000128_S0000012	AND I SAW HIM FIRST DO THAT IN THE EARLY 90S WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE WAR IN THE BALKANS. BUT I'VE SEEN HIM DO THAT ALSO, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF THE ROMA.
YOU1000000128_S0000013	AND OTHER MINORITIES ALL OVER EUROPE, REFUGEES, ETC. SO WITH A MAN WHO IS ALWAYS WILLING TO PICK A GOOD FIGHT, TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, AND TO SEE AHEAD.
YOU1000000128_S0000014	AHEAD, SOONER THAN MANY OF US CAN SEE. I'M REALLY KEEN TO HEAR FROM HIM WHAT IS ON HIS MIND AND WHERE HE THINKS
YOU1000000128_S0000015	WE SHOULD ALL BE GOING. GEORGE, LET ME GIVE YOU THE FLOOR. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
YOU1000000128_S0000017	THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.
YOU1000000128_S0000019	WE LIVE IN A REVOLUTIONARY HISTORY. AT TIMES LIKE THESE, THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES IS FAR GREATER THAN IN NORMAL TIMES.
YOU1000000128_S0000021	EVENTS THAT ARE INCONCEIVABLE IN NORMAL TIMES NOT ONLY BECOME POSSIBLE BUT ACTUALLY HAPPEN.
YOU1000000128_S0000023	I HAVE DEVELOPED AN ENTIRE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE THIN PILLARS OF FALLIBILITY AND REFLEXIVITY.
YOU1000000128_S0000024	TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THE PRESENT.
YOU1000000128_S0000026	THAT'S WHAT HAS ALLOWED ME TO MAKE A FORTUNE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.
YOU1000000128_S0000028	IN THE VERY FIRST DAYS OF JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, I REALIZED THAT WE HAD ENTERED A GLOBAL CRISIS THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF HISTORY.
YOU1000000128_S0000030	THAT'S WHEN IRANIAN GENERAL SOLEIMANI WAS ASSASSINATED IN IRAQ.
YOU1000000128_S0000032	THAT TOLD ME.
YOU1000000128_S0000033	THAT COUNTRIES WERE MORE INTERESTED IN FIGHTING EACH OTHER THAN IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU1000000128_S0000035	AS YOU KNOW, CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND IT REQUIRES GLOBAL COOPERATION TO MAKE IT UNDER CONTROL.
YOU1000000128_S0000037	THEN CAME THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS THAT THOROUGHLY DISRUPTED PEOPLE'S LIVES AND ENDED YET ANOTHER GLOBAL PROBLEM.
YOU1000000128_S0000039	WHAT DIRECTION WILL HISTORY TAKE?
YOU1000000128_S0000041	THAT'S A QUESTION NOBODY CAN ANSWER BECAUSE THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON DECISIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN TAKEN.
YOU1000000128_S0000043	NEVERTHELESS, I BELIEVE MY OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS ARE WELL SITUATED TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
YOU1000000128_S0000045	I PERSONALLY HAVE FOCUSED ON AREAS WHERE I HAVE EXPERIENCE AND A HISTORICAL BACKGROUND.
YOU1000000128_S0000047	THAT LED ME TO TWO PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT ARE OF GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE.
YOU1000000128_S0000049	ONE IS THE PLAN.
YOU1000000128_S0000051	FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO ISSUE A NEW ROUND OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS.
YOU1000000128_S0000053	AND TO PERSUADE RICH COUNTRIES TO DONATE THEIR ALLOCATIONS WHICH THEY DON'T NEED TO POOR COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR THEM.
YOU1000000128_S0000055	TO EXPLAIN THE IDEA BETTER.
YOU1000000128_S0000057	THE SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS ARE SYNTHETIC MONEY CREATED BY THE IMF.
YOU1000000128_S0000059	SDRS ARE ALLOCATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEMBER COUNTRIES' SHAREHOLDING IN THE IMF.
YOU1000000128_S0000061	RICH COUNTRIES DON'T NEED THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN RAISE ISSUE MONEY IN THEIR OWN NAME IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.
YOU1000000128_S0000063	THE CAPACITY OF FOUR COUNTRIES TO DO SO IS EXTREMELY LIMITED.
YOU1000000128_S0000064	THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR RICH COUNTRIES TO DONATE THEIR ALLOCATIONS TO POOR ONES.
YOU1000000128_S0000066	AS REGARDS HISTORICALLY.
YOU1000000128_S0000068	I AM NOT SURE IF WE HAVE A TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY, WHETHER WE HAVE LOST GEORGE.
YOU1000000128_S0000070	THE CONNECTION WITH GEORGE.
YOU1000000128_S0000072	I'M AFRAID WE HAVE LOST THE CONNECTION WITH GEORGE, SO HOPEFULLY HE WILL SOON COME BACK IN AND RECONNECT.
YOU1000000128_S0000074	SO PLEASE BE PATIENT.
YOU1000000128_S0000076	AND I'M SORRY, AS I'M USING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY.
YOU1000000128_S0000079	THERE YOU ARE, GEORGE. GEORGE, YOU'RE BACK. WE ARE RECONNECTED.
YOU1000000128_S0000080	VERY GOOD.
YOU1000000128_S0000082	SO NEVERTHELESS.
YOU1000000128_S0000084	ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSED THE IDEA AND ARGUED THAT THE BEST AND PERHAPS ONLY WAY TO RAISE ONE OR TWO TRILLION EUROS
YOU1000000128_S0000085	IS BY ISSUING PERPETUAL BONDS.
YOU1000000128_S0000087	THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF PERPETUAL BONDS IS THAT THE PRINCIPAL NEVER HAS TO BE REPAID. ONLY THE ANNUAL INTEREST IS DUE.
YOU1000000128_S0000089	THIS MAKES THEM VERY EFFICIENT.
YOU1000000128_S0000091	THEY HAVE A COST BENEFIT RATIO THAT IS ALMOST 10 TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE LONG TERM BONDS THAT THE COMMISSION IS PROPOSING TO USE.
YOU1000000128_S0000093	THIS SOUNDS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE, BUT IT'S TRUE.
YOU1000000128_S0000095	ASSUMING 0.5% INTEREST.
YOU1000000128_S0000097	WHICH IS QUITE GENEROUS IN THE CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.
YOU1000000128_S0000099	1 TRILLION EUROS WOULD COST ONLY 5 BILLION ANNUALLY.
YOU1000000128_S0000101	THE INTEREST WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID FOREVER, BUT THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS DIMINISHES PROGRESSIVELY
YOU1000000128_S0000102	UNTIL IT APPROACHES BUT DOESN'T QUITE REACH ZERO.
YOU1000000128_S0000104	MOST IMPORTANTLY, PERPETUAL BONDS COULD BE ISSUED AS SOON AS MEMBER STATES AUTHORIZE SUFFICIENT OWNED RESOURCES.
YOU1000000128_S0000105	TO MAINTAIN THE TRIPLE A RATING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
YOU1000000128_S0000107	OWN RESOURCES WOULD COME FROM NEWLY AUTHORIZED TAXES SUCH AS A TAX ON CARBON EMISSIONS.
YOU1000000128_S0000109	THE TAXES WOULD ONLY HAVE TO BE AUTHORIZED, THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BE IMPOSED.
YOU1000000128_S0000110	BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG AND SPEED IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE.
YOU1000000128_S0000112	THE PROFESSIONAL BONDS DON'T NEED TO BE ISSUED IN ONE GO. THEY COULD BE SOLD IN TRANCHES.
YOU1000000128_S0000114	THE FIRST SCIENTISTS WOULD BE SNATCHED UP BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER LONG TERM INVESTORS.
YOU1000000128_S0000115	WHO ARE STRUNG OF ASSETS TO MATCH THEIR LIABILITIES.
YOU1000000128_S0000117	AS THE MARKET FAMILIARIZED THEMSELVES WITH THE NEW INSTRUMENT, OTHER INVESTORS WOULD BE ATTRACTED TO IT.
YOU1000000128_S0000119	AND AS THE BOND MARKET, AS THE BONDS BECAME ACTIVELY TRADED,
YOU1000000128_S0000121	THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO INVEST IN THEM.
YOU1000000128_S0000123	THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN FUNDS RAISED FROM THE EU'S OWN RESOURCES AND THOSE THAT ARE CONTRIBUTED BY MEMBER STATES.
YOU1000000128_S0000125	THE LATTER HAVE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBER STATES ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAREHOLDING IN THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK.
YOU1000000128_S0000127	THE FORMER CAN BE GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION TO THOSE WHO MOST IN NEED.
YOU1000000128_S0000129	THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AID THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN PROVIDE.
YOU1000000128_S0000130	FOR INSTANCE,
YOU1000000128_S0000132	IT COULD ASSIST THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVELIHOOD BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS.
YOU1000000128_S0000133	CURRENTLY, THEY HAVE TO DEPEND ON THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS WHOSE CAPACITIES VARY.
YOU1000000128_S0000134	IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EQUITABLE IF THE SUPPORT CAME FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION.
YOU1000000128_S0000136	HUH.
YOU1000000128_S0000138	WHY DID THE MEMBER STATES IGNORE SO STUDIOUSLY AN INSTRUMENT THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED TO THE CURRENT SITUATION?
YOU1000000128_S0000140	THEY WERE AWARE OF PERPETUAL BONDS BECAUSE SPAIN CHAMPIONED THEM AT A VIRTUAL SUMMIT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON APRIL 23RD.
YOU1000000128_S0000141	AND THEY WERE LISTED AS ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT DESERVED FURTHER CONSIDERATION.
YOU1000000128_S0000143	MY GUESS IS THAT THE PERPETUAL BONDS WERE DISMISSED OUT OF HAND.
YOU1000000128_S0000144	BECAUSE THEY WERE CONFUSED WITH CORONA BOMBS.
YOU1000000128_S0000146	THE LETTERS WERE DECISIVELY REJECTED BY MEMBER STATES BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WERE UNWILLING TO GO THAT FAR.
YOU1000000128_S0000148	IN REALITY, PERPETUAL BONDS ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF CORONA BONDS.
YOU1000000128_S0000150	PERPETUAL BONDS REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN, CORONA BONDS INCREASE IT.
YOU1000000128_S0000152	TO AVOID CONFUSION, I NOW TRY TO AVOID USING THE TERM PERPETUAL BONDS.
YOU1000000128_S0000154	I PREFER TO USE THE WORD CONSOLES.
YOU1000000128_S0000156	THAT'S THE NAME THE UK AND THE US USED FOR CENTURIES TO DESCRIBE PERPETUAL BONDS.
YOU1000000128_S0000158	THE UK STARTED IN 1752 AND THE US IN THE 1870S.
YOU1000000128_S0000160	INTERESTINGLY, THE NETHERLANDS
YOU1000000128_S0000162	PREDATED THE OTHER TWO COUNTRIES.
YOU1000000128_S0000164	A DUTCH WATER BOARD ISSUED PERPETUAL BONDS IN 1648.
YOU1000000128_S0000165	TO REPAIR A DIKE.
YOU1000000128_S0000167	THE BONDS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING.
YOU1000000128_S0000168	BUT THE ANNUAL INTEREST HAS BECOME SO SMALL THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS NOT EVEN AWARE OF THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE.
YOU1000000128_S0000170	AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE DUTCH ACTUALLY INVENTED THE IDEA.
YOU1000000128_S0000171	YET TODAY THEY ARE THE MOST ARDENT OPPONENTS.
YOU1000000128_S0000172	THEY ARE THE LEADERS OF THE SO CALLED FRUGAL FOUR.
YOU1000000128_S0000174	IN 1648, THE NETHERLANDS FACED A SERIOUS THREAT FROM FLOODING.
YOU1000000128_S0000176	TODAY, THE COMBINATION OF THE VIRUS AND CLIMATE CHANGE POSES AN EVEN GREATER DANGER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION.
YOU1000000128_S0000178	IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF EUROPE IN GENERAL AND THE FRUGAL FOUR IN PARTICULAR FAILED TO GIVE CONSULS THE CONSIDERATION THEY DESERVE.
YOU1000000128_S0000180	I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE BOUND TO BE LEGAL OBJECTIONS.
YOU1000000128_S0000181	BASED ON THE TFEU THAT CONTAINS ALL THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE EUROPEAN UNION.
YOU1000000128_S0000183	I BELIEVE THE OBJECTIONS COULD BE OVERCOME.
YOU1000000128_S0000184	BY ARGUING THAT THE AUTHORS OF THE TFEU WERE NOT AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF CONSOLES.
YOU1000000128_S0000185	THEREFORE, ITS REGULATIONS DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM.
YOU1000000128_S0000187	I ALSO ANTICIPATE
YOU1000000128_S0000189	MORAL OBJECTIONS FROM GERMAN SPEAKING PEOPLE.
YOU1000000128_S0000190	THE GERMAN WORD SCHULD HAS A DOUBLE MEANING, DEBT AND GUILT.
YOU1000000128_S0000192	IT FOLLOWS THAT DEBTORS SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
YOU1000000128_S0000194	THAT MAKES PERPETUAL BONDS THAT NEVER HAVE TO BE REPAID MORALLY INADMISSIBLE.
YOU1000000128_S0000196	THERE IS ONE LEGITIMATE OBJECTION THAT MAY BE RAISED.
YOU1000000128_S0000198	ONCE YOU START USING CONSOLES, YOU MAY END UP ABUSING THEM.
YOU1000000128_S0000200	BUT THE FACT THAT THE LARGE SCALE USE OF EUROPE'S AAA CREDIT IS ALREADY DESIGNATED AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE
YOU1000000128_S0000202	THAT SHOULD BE ENSURED.
YOU1000000128_S0000203	THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE USED IN NORMAL TIMES.
YOU1000000128_S0000205	THEY OFFER A FINANCIAL TOOL IDEALLY SUITED TO THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
YOU1000000128_S0000207	AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABUSED IN NORMAL TIMES.
YOU1000000128_S0000209	SO WHY ALL THIS HOSTILITY?
YOU1000000128_S0000211	I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS TO BE FOUND IN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS.
YOU1000000128_S0000213	THE COMMISSION WAS NOT AWARE OF PERPETUAL BONDS WHEN IT PROPOSED A RECOVERY PLAN.
YOU1000000128_S0000215	IT WAS RELYING ON THE ONLY INSTRUMENT OVER WHICH IT HAD SOME CONTROL, NAMELY THE BUDGET.
YOU1000000128_S0000217	THAT FOCUSED THE ATTENTION OF MEMBER STATES AND INTEREST GROUPS.
YOU1000000128_S0000218	ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED, NOT ON HOW THEY WERE GENERATED.
YOU1000000128_S0000220	INTERESTED PARTIES ARE NOW HAGGLING WITH EACH OTHER.
YOU1000000128_S0000221	FOR INSTANCE, THE FRUGAL FOUR WANT TO PROTECT THEIR DISCOUNTS FROM THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BUDGET.
YOU1000000128_S0000223	IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO REALIZE THAT THE BUDGET CAN GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE EUROPEAN UNION NEEDS.
YOU1000000128_S0000225	THAT'S WHEN THE CONSOLES WILL BE RECOGNIZED
YOU1000000128_S0000226	AS AN INDISPENSABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.
YOU1000000128_S0000228	BUT BY THAT TIME, IT MAY BE TOO LATE.
YOU1000000128_S0000230	WE MUST THEREFORE ACCELERATE THE PROCESS.
YOU1000000128_S0000232	THE MONEY IS NEEDED NOW.
YOU1000000128_S0000238	AND SHE HAS FULLY RECOVERED HER POLITICAL INFLUENCE.
YOU1000000128_S0000240	SHE ALSO HAS CAPABLE SUPPORTERS IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE.
YOU1000000128_S0000242	WHO UNDERSTAND THE MERITS OF CONSULS.
YOU1000000128_S0000244	IN ADDITION TO DEALING WITH THE VIRUS.
YOU1000000128_S0000245	CONSULTS SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO ADDRESS GRAMMAR CHANGE.
YOU1000000128_S0000247	RECENTLY A STRONG MOVEMENT HAS DEVELOPED.
YOU1000000128_S0000249	TO RAISE THE 2030 CLIMATE TARGET
YOU1000000128_S0000250	FROM 40% TO 55%.
YOU1000000128_S0000251	A NUMBER OF MAINLY EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE OBJECTING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET THE HIGHER TARGET.
YOU1000000128_S0000253	THAT COULD BE READILY REMEDIED WITH AN ADDITIONAL TRILLION EUROS OF CONSOLES.
YOU1000000128_S0000254	OF COURSE, THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TO CAREFULLY MONITOR THAT THE FUNDS ARE NOT MISDIRECTED AND MISUSED.
YOU1000000128_S0000256	IN THIS WAY, THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD MEET THE TWO GREAT CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME.
YOU1000000128_S0000257	AND FULFILL THE EXPECTATIONS OF ITS CITIZENS. THAT WOULD BE A TRULY GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT. THANK YOU.
YOU1000000129_S0000000	THERE ARE BUT A FEW MEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY WHO HAVE ACCUMULATED FORTUNES LIKE THAT OF ANDREW CARNEGIE, A MAN WHO WAS AS COMPLEX AS HE WAS RICH.
YOU1000000129_S0000001	AFTER SELLING HIS COMPANY, HIS NET WORTH WOULD EQUAL A STAGGERING 2% OF AMERICA'S GDP.
YOU1000000129_S0000002	IN TODAY'S VIDEO, WE'LL EXPLORE HOW ONE SCOTTISH IMMIGRANT ARMED WITH JUST FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING WOULD RISE FROM POVERTY TO THE STATUS OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN.
YOU1000000129_S0000004	THIS VIDEO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF IT WASN'T FOR OUR FRIENDS AT ACORNS, AN INVESTMENT APP WITH OVER 6 MILLION USERS THAT MAKES INVESTING AS EASY AS SPENDING.

YOU1000000129_S0000006	THAT'S FREE MONEY TO HELP YOU GET STARTED WITH INVESTING, SO BE SURE TO CHECK THEM OUT. THE LINK IS IN THE VIDEO DESCRIPTION BELOW.
YOU1000000129_S0000008	CARNEGIE WAS AT ONE POINT THE RICHEST AMERICAN IN HISTORY, BUT HE WASN'T BORN IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000129_S0000009	ANDREW'S STORY BEGINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN DUNFERMLINE, SCOTLAND, WHERE HE GREW UP IN WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ABJECT POVERTY.
YOU1000000129_S0000010	HIS MOTHER WOULD WORK AROUND THE CLOCK, SEWING SHOES. HIS FATHER WOULD MAKE CLOTH AND OTHER MATERIAL, HAND WEAVING LOOMS.
YOU1000000129_S0000011	THAT WAS, OF COURSE, UNTIL THE STEAM POWERED LOOM CAME INTO THE PICTURE. WITH WEAVING TECHNOLOGY RAPIDLY IMPROVING, HIS FATHER'S LOOM BUSINESS WOULD CRUMBLE, FINDING HIMSELF CRUSHED BY THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.
YOU1000000129_S0000012	WATCHING HIS FATHER SUFFER AS HE BEGGED FOR WORK WOULD IMPACT THE YOUNG CARNEGIE PROFOUNDLY. IN 1848, THE CARNEGIES SET OUT IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE OUTSIDE SCOTLAND. AFTER SELLING ALL OF THEIR POSSESSIONS AND BORROWING £20,
YOU1000000129_S0000013	THE FAMILY EMBARKED ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY, AMERICA. THEY WOULD RESTART THEIR LIVES FROM SCRATCH IN PITTSBURGH, THE HUB OF MANUFACTURING, BUT STILL FOUND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO ESCAPE HARDSHIP IN THEIR NEW COUNTRY.
YOU1000000129_S0000014	HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BOTH STRUGGLED TO FIND WORK, LEAVING ANDREW NO CHOICE BUT TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY. HE WOULD FINALLY CATCH A BREAK FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE BOILER ROOMS WHEN HE LANDED A JOB AT A LOCAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE.
YOU1000000129_S0000015	AS A MESSENGER BOY, HE WOULD DELIVER TELEGRAMS BY BIKE ALL OVER PITTSBURGH. HE WOULD MEMORIZE THE FACES OF EVERYONE HE DELIVERED TO SO THAT HE COULD GREET THEM BY NAME IF HE SAW THEM OUTSIDE OF WORK.
YOU1000000129_S0000016	IT WOULD PROVIDE CARNEGIE WITH A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE CITY'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AT 17, HE WOULD PERFECT HIS TELEGRAPH SKILLS. HE WOULD GROW INCREASINGLY SKILLED AT HEARING MORSE CODE.
YOU1000000129_S0000017	IMPRESSIVELY, HE COULD RECITE MESSAGES WITHOUT NEEDING TO WRITE THEM DOWN. THIS CAUGHT THE EYE OF THOMAS SCOTT, A REGIONAL MANAGER FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY, WHO HIRED CARNEGIE TO BE HIS PERSONAL TELEGRAPHER.
YOU1000000129_S0000018	AND PRIVATE SECRETARY FOR THE SUM OF $35 A MONTH. AT THE TIME, THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY WAS THE LARGEST CORPORATION IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000129_S0000019	FOR THE BUSINESS SAVVY CARNEGIE, IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE NONE OTHER. A FRONT ROW SEAT ON HOW TO RUN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
YOU1000000129_S0000020	TOM SCOTT, HIS BOSS, REALIZED CARNEGIE'S POTENTIAL AND DECIDED TO TAKE THE BOY UNDER HIS WING, MENTORING HIM LIKE A SECOND FATHER.
YOU1000000129_S0000021	IT WOULD LATER BE TOM'S ADVICE TO INVEST IN STOCKS THAT PROVIDED CARNEGIE WITH HIS FIRST TASTE OF CAPITALISM. FAST FORWARD TO THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR. CARNEGIE IS DRAFTED INTO THE UNION, BUT INSTEAD OF FIGHTING IN THE WAR,
YOU1000000129_S0000022	CARNEGIE WOULD PROFIT FROM IT. HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE HARM'S WAY AFTER PAYING $850 FOR A SUBSTITUTE TO TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT CARNEGIE NOTICED THAT THE WOODEN BRIDGES WERE EASILY BURNT BY THE TROOPS.
YOU1000000129_S0000023	AND THAT THERE WAS A DESPERATE NEED FOR IRON BRIDGES TO REPLACE THEM. HE CAPITALIZED ON THE OPPORTUNITY, LAUNCHING THE KEYSTONE BRIDGE COMPANY. BUT IT WOULD BE HIS NEXT MOVE THAT WOULD DEFINE HIM AS AN ASTUTE BUSINESSMAN.
YOU1000000129_S0000024	KEYSTONE DIDN'T JUST BUILD BRIDGES. THEY ALSO HAD THEIR VERY OWN IRON MILLS, WHICH PROVIDED THE IRON THAT WAS NEEDED FOR CONSTRUCTING THE BRIDGES.
YOU1000000129_S0000025	OWNING THE IRON SOURCE MEANT THAT CARNEGIE'S BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON MINING OR EXTRACTING COMPANIES FOR IRON, LIKE THEIR COMPETITORS. THIS NOT ONLY GAVE CARNEGIE MORE CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE PROCESS, IT ALSO IMPROVED THEIR MARGINS.
YOU1000000129_S0000026	AFTER THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT, HE WOULD LEVERAGE HIS CONNECTIONS IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY TO MAKE MONEY THERE TOO. ESSENTIALLY, HE WAS OPERATING A TRIAD OF THREE COMPANIES, EACH STRENGTHENING ONE ANOTHER.
YOU1000000129_S0000027	FIRST, A MINING EXTRACTION COMPANY. SECOND, A BRIDGE BUILDING COMPANY, WHICH USED THE IRON PROVIDED FROM HIS MINING COMPANY. AND THEN, ONCE THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT, HIS THIRD BUSINESS WOULD MONETIZE BY SELLING RAIL.
YOU1000000129_S0000028	THE CONCEPT WORKED TO A TEE.
YOU1000000129_S0000029	ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE NEXT BIG OPPORTUNITY, ANDREW SET HIS SIGHTS ON NEW YORK CITY, THE UNDISPUTED BUSINESS CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. IN THE CITY, HE EXPECTED TO FIND A HUSTLING CULTURE AND MINGLE WITH OTHER DISTINGUISHED BUSINESSMEN.
YOU1000000129_S0000030	BUT WHAT HE FOUND INSTEAD WAS DISAPPOINTMENT. HE WOULD DESCRIBE THE WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AROUND HIM AS SCOUNDRELS.
YOU1000000129_S0000031	CARNEGIE WROTE A NOTE TO HIMSELF PROMISING THAT IN TWO YEARS, WHEN HE TURNED 35, HE WOULD RETIRE AND FOCUS ON MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
YOU1000000129_S0000032	BUT THIS NOTE WOULD GO UNFULFILLED. IN 1856, A NEW INVENTION BY HENRY BESSEMER CALLED THE BESSEMER CONVERTER
YOU1000000129_S0000034	A PEAR SHAPED FURNACE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE MASS PRODUCTION OF STEEL, SOMETHING PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, IT WOULD FINALLY BECOME FEASIBLE TO CREATE LARGE STRUCTURES FROM STEEL.
YOU1000000129_S0000035	EVENTUALLY GIVING BIRTH TO THE FIRST SKYSCRAPERS, FOREVER TRANSFORMING A CITY'S SKYLINE. CARNEGIE MOVED WITH LIGHTNING SPEED, SUCCESSFULLY BUILDING AMERICA'S FIRST STEEL PLANTS.
YOU1000000129_S0000036	IN DOING SO, HE HIRED THE BEST ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS THAT MONEY COULD BUY. HE FOCUSED MANIACALLY ON INCREASING EFFICIENCY, ALWAYS USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND PUSHING HIS EMPLOYEES TO THEIR MAXIMUM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CAPABILITIES.
YOU1000000129_S0000037	HE WAS ALSO NOTORIOUS FOR REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO WORK 364 DAYS A YEAR, ONLY ALLOWING FOR REST ON THE 4TH OF JULY.
YOU1000000129_S0000038	AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUED TO ADVANCE, HE WOULD SEEK WAYS TO REPLACE HIS WORKERS WITH MACHINES AT EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY.
YOU1000000129_S0000039	UNLIKE MEN, MACHINES DIDN'T NEED SLEEP, THEY ALSO DIDN'T ASK FOR RAISES, AND THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT TRY TO UNIONIZE.
YOU1000000129_S0000040	CARNEGIE, A MASTER SALESMAN, DECIDED TO NAME THE VENTURE NOT CARNEGIE STEEL, BUT RATHER J. EDGAR THOMPSON STEELWORKS, THE NAME OF ONE OF HIS CUSTOMERS IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY.
YOU1000000129_S0000041	CARNEGIE HOPED A STEEL MILL NAMED AFTER A CUSTOMER WOULD SHOW HIS APPRECIATION FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND MAYBE EVEN SECURE MORE ORDERS FROM THEIR RAILROAD. AND IT DID. THE FIRST ORDER FROM THOMPSON CONSISTED OF 2,000 STEEL RAILS.
YOU1000000129_S0000042	NAMING A MILL AFTER A CUSTOMER WAS MORE THAN A SALES GIMMICK. IT WAS PART OF A LARGER STRATEGY, SHOWING APPRECIATION IN PUBLIC FOR OTHERS.
YOU1000000129_S0000043	ACTS LIKE THIS WOULD CONTINUE TO PAY MASSIVE DIVIDENDS THROUGHOUT THE TITAN'S CAREER. TO HELP RUN CARNEGIE STEEL MILLS, HE WOULD BRING ON BOARD A CUTTHROAT EXECUTIVE KNOWN FOR HIS RUTHLESSNESS AND ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE.
YOU1000000129_S0000044	HENRY CLAY FRICK. AS A TEEN, CARNEGIE AND FRICK WERE A POWERFUL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. AND TO SHOW HOW RUTHLESS THE TWO COULD BE, LOOK NO FARTHER THAN THE STORY ABOUT DUQUESNE WORKS.
YOU1000000129_S0000045	WITH THE HELP OF FRICK, CARNEGIE SPREAD A RUMOR WHICH ALLEGED THAT DUQUESNE'S MILL WAS PRODUCING DEFECTIVE STEEL. IT WASN'T TRUE, BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.
YOU1000000129_S0000046	CARNEGIE CLAIMED TO DUQUESNE'S RAILROAD CUSTOMERS THAT THEIR RAILS LACKED WHAT HE CALLED HOMOGENEITY. FEW, IF ANYONE, ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT THE WORD MEANT, BUT THAT WASN'T IMPORTANT.
YOU1000000129_S0000047	CARNEGIE USED THE WORD BECAUSE IT SOUNDED SCARY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN OFF RAILROADS WHO WERE CONCERNED THAT THEY WEREN'T GETTING GOOD PRODUCTS. IF DUQUESNE'S SALES SLOWED, THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME UNPROFITABLE AND RUN OUT OF MONEY.
YOU1000000129_S0000048	TO EXPEDITE THEIR DEMISE, CARNEGIE AND FRICK WOULD PROCEED TO UNDERCUT DUQUESNE ON PRICE, FURTHER SQUEEZING THE COMPANY.
YOU1000000129_S0000049	WITHIN TWO YEARS, DUQUESNE'S FINANCES WERE IN RUINS, LEAVING IT NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO SELL TO NONE OTHER THAN CARNEGIE AT A BARGAIN PRICE.
YOU1000000129_S0000050	FOR FRICK AND CARNEGIE, THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WERE CLEAR – DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN. BUT THIS RUTHLESSNESS CAME WITH A HEFTY PRICE, AS THEY WOULD SOON DISCOVER AT ONE OF THEIR LARGEST STEEL PLANTS IN HOMESTEAD, PENNSYLVANIA.
YOU1000000129_S0000051	CARNEGIE HAD JUST INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OPTIMIZING THE EFFICIENCY OF HOMESTEAD, ENABLING IT TO PRODUCE MORE STEEL THAN ANY OTHER MILL COMPARABLE TO ITS SIZE.
YOU1000000129_S0000052	BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE PROFIT MACHINE THAT WAS YET TO BE OPTIMIZED. LABOR COSTS. THIS POSED A PROBLEM FOR CARNEGIE, WHO HAD BEEN WORKING ON REBRANDING HIS IMAGE FROM AN OPPRESSIVE STEEL FACTORY BILLIONAIRE TO A CHAMPION OF WORKERS' RIGHTS.
YOU1000000129_S0000053	SO, INSTEAD OF RISKING HIS REPUTATION, HE WOULD HAVE HIS RIGHT HAND LIEUTENANT, HENRY FRICK, EXECUTE THE DIRTY WORK. MEANWHILE, CARNEGIE WOULD DISTANCE HIMSELF, TRAVELING ABROAD TO HIS HOME COUNTRY OF SCOTLAND.
YOU1000000129_S0000054	CARNEGIE KNEW THAT HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE AROUND THE PLANT AFTER CUTTING WAGES FOR 10,000 ALREADY FRUSTRATED LOW PAID WORKERS.
YOU1000000129_S0000055	IN 1892, TENSIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND MILL OWNERS WERE PARTICULARLY HEIGHTENED, AFTER AN EVER WIDENING WEALTH GAP CONTINUED TO GROW. THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA WERE ACCUMULATING FORTUNES FASTER THAN AT ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
YOU1000000129_S0000056	MEANWHILE, WORKERS FELT THAT THEY WERE PROPERTY OF THE RICH AND THAT THEIR SHRINKING VOICE COULD ONLY BE HEARD THROUGH A UNION. TO MAKE THINGS EVEN WORSE,
YOU1000000129_S0000057	FRICK, WHO TOOK HIS ORDERS FROM CARNEGIE, DEMANDED INCREASED FACTORY PRODUCTION, WHICH WOULD MEAN EVEN MORE HOURS SLAVING AWAY. BUT TO TOP IT ALL OFF, FRICK WOULD NOT BE INCREASING THEIR INCOME.
YOU1000000129_S0000058	HE'D BE REDUCING IT. LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY PUT HOMESTEAD AT A BOILING POINT. THE STRIKERS ALSO DEMANDED SAFER WORKING CONDITIONS, AND FOR A GOOD REASON.
YOU1000000129_S0000059	IN 1898, 9% OF ALL STEELWORKERS, INDUSTRY WIDE, WOULD DIE ON THE JOB. WHEN THE WORKERS REFUSED FRICK'S AGGRESSIVE DEMANDS FOR LONGER HOURS AND LESS PAY, HE DECIDED TO LOCK OUT ALL EMPLOYEES.
YOU1000000129_S0000060	AND BRING IN A SUBSTITUTE GROUP OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THEIR DANGEROUS JOBS FOR LESS.
YOU1000000129_S0000061	TO ESCORT THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS AS THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FACTORY, FRICK CALLED ON A 300 PERSON ARMY FOR HIRE CALLED THE PINKERTONS. ARMED WITH RIFLES,
YOU1000000129_S0000062	THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FACTORY, WHERE THEY WERE MET BY 10,000 ANGRY STRIKERS REFUSING TO GIVE UP WHAT THEY CALLED HOME.
YOU1000000129_S0000063	HISTORIANS DON'T KNOW WHO FIRED THE FIRST GUNSHOT, BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE DAY WOULD NO LONGER BE CALLED THE HOMESTEAD STRIKE.
YOU1000000129_S0000064	BUT RATHER THE HOMESTEAD MASSACRE. BY THE END OF THE BATTLE, NINE FACTORY WORKERS AND SEVEN PINKERTONS WOULD BE DEAD.
YOU1000000129_S0000066	HUNDREDS WOULD BE INJURED. THE FIGHTING WAS SO EXTREME THAT THE GOVERNOR ORDERED FOR 8,000 MILITIA TROOPS TO PROVIDE BACKUP. UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE STATE'S TROOPS, THE FACTORY WOULD BE REOPENED.
YOU1000000129_S0000067	AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR CARNEGIE'S WORKERS, THEY WOULD BE RETURNING WITH LOWER PAY, LONGER WORKING HOURS, AND THE SAME SAFETY CONDITIONS.
YOU1000000129_S0000068	ANOTHER COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM HOMESTEAD CAME IN THE FORM OF CARNEGIE'S REPUTATION. PRIOR TO THE TRAGEDIES AT HOMESTEAD, HE WOULD OFTEN ADVOCATE IN PUBLIC FOR BETTER CONDITIONS IN STEEL MILLS AND INCREASED WAGES.
YOU1000000129_S0000069	BUT THESE WORDS WERE FAR FROM ALIGNED WITH HIS ACTIONS. HYPOCRISY WAS INCREDIBLY PREVALENT. WHILE HE PREACHED INCREASED WAGES AND IMPROVED SAFETY CONDITIONS,
YOU1000000129_S0000070	HE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING LABOR COSTS BY SLASHING PAYCHECKS AND DOING LITTLE, IF ANYTHING, TO MAKE HIS FACTORIES A SAFER PLACE TO WORK.
YOU1000000129_S0000071	CARNEGIE WAS WIDELY CALLED A COWARD FOR USING FRICK AS HIS SCAPEGOAT, NOT ONLY FOR THE TRAGEDY, BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER DIRTY WORK THAT HE DIDN'T WANT HIS NAME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH.
YOU1000000129_S0000072	BUT IN SPITE OF THE TENSIONS AND ANIMOSITY, THE STEEL MILLS CONTINUED TO THRIVE. IN FACT, BY 1900, THE COMPANY WOULD PRODUCE MORE STEEL THAN THE ENTIRE NATION OF GREAT BRITAIN.
YOU1000000129_S0000073	BUT IN 1901, CARNEGIE GREW TIRED OF THE GAME AND WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.
YOU1000000129_S0000074	FINANCIER J.P. MORGAN WAS A RISING COMPETITOR IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY, AND CARNEGIE, NOW NEARING 70, BECAME OPEN TO THE IDEA OF SELLING THE COMPANY HE'D SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE BUILDING.
YOU1000000129_S0000075	CARNEGIE WROTE ON A SCRAP OF PAPER WHAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT. CHARLES SCHWAB, THE PRESIDENT OF CARNEGIE STEEL, DELIVERED THE OFFER TO MORGAN.
YOU1000000129_S0000076	AS THE STORY GOES, J.P. MORGAN GLANCED AT THE OFFER AND WITHOUT HESITATION ACCEPTED IT. MORGAN WOULD BUY CARNEGIE STEEL FOR $480 MILLION, MAKING CARNEGIE THE SINGLE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME.
YOU1000000129_S0000077	CARNEGIE WOULD COMPLETELY CUT TIES WITH HIS BUSINESS LIFE AND DEDICATE 100% OF HIMSELF TO SERVING THE WORLD THROUGH PHILANTHROPY. NOT A SINGLE DOLLAR WOULD BE LEFT TO HIS FAMILY.
YOU1000000129_S0000078	BECAUSE ANDREW HAD ONLY FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING, HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR LIBRARIES, WHICH HE CREDITS FOR HELPING HIM ACHIEVE THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ACQUIRED.
YOU1000000129_S0000079	OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE, HE WOULD DONATE OVER TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND LIBRARIES TO CITIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD. BUT IT WASN'T ALL SELF PROMOTION. HE WAS GENEROUS FOR GENEROSITY'S SAKE. HIS NAME WAS ONLY DISPLAYED ON LESS THAN 500 OF THOSE LIBRARIES.
YOU1000000129_S0000080	ONE EXAMPLE OF HIS GENEROSITY IS CARNEGIE HALL, ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARKS. BUILT IN 1891, CARNEGIE BUILT AND DONATED THE BUILDING AS THE MUSIC HALL.
YOU1000000129_S0000081	BUT ITS ORIGINAL NAME OF THE MUSIC HALL WAS ONLY CHANGED TO THE CURRENT VERSION AFTER HIS DEATH, AND NOT BY HIS REQUEST BUT THROUGH THE MUSIC HALL'S BOARD MEMBERS. AND FROM 1901 UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1919 IN LENOX, MASSACHUSETTS,
YOU1000000129_S0000082	CARNEGIE'S FULL TIME JOB WAS GIVING AWAY THE VAST WEALTH HE HAD BUILT UP FOR HIMSELF. AS WE MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS STORY, CARNEGIE WAS A MAN WHO WAS AS COMPLEX AS HE WAS RICH.
YOU1000000129_S0000083	DID HE EMPLOY ABUSIVE LABOR TECHNIQUES TO KEEP HIS FACTORIES PRODUCING MAXIMUM PROFIT? YES. WAS HE HYPOCRITICAL? OF COURSE. DID HE MAKE UP SLANDER TO PUT HIS COMPETITORS OUT OF BUSINESS? ABSOLUTELY.
YOU1000000129_S0000084	WHILE THESE THINGS ARE ALL TRUE, CARNEGIE'S PHILANTHROPIC IMPACT IS ALSO EQUALLY GREAT. PERPLEXING TO SAY THE LEAST, HOW CAN A MAN COMMIT SUCH SINS AND THEN BECOME A SAINT?
YOU1000000129_S0000085	PERHAPS HE VIEWED DONATING HIS MONEY AS A WAY TO ATONE FOR HIS BUSINESS SINS. MAKING MONEY IS A GREAT FEELING, BUT AN EVEN BETTER FEELING IS GIVING IT AWAY. IF YOU WANT TO GROW WEALTH AND PERHAPS DONATE TO NOBLE CAUSES LIKE CARNEGIE DID,

YOU1000000130_S0000000	HENRY FORD, ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AMERICAN INDUSTRIALISTS. THROUGH HIS COMPANY, HENRY TRANSFORMED AMERICAN LIFE AND IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GONNA LEARN HOW HE DID IT, STARTING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
YOU1000000130_S0000002	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY AUDIBLE, AND A BIG PART OF IT IS BASED ON HENRY FORD'S BIOGRAPHY, WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE ON AUDIBLE IF YOU REGISTER FOR A FREE TRIAL WITH THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION.
YOU1000000130_S0000003	YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK OUT REAL ENGINEERING'S VIDEO ON THE MANUFACTURING INNOVATIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY LINE, WHICH HE EXPLAINS MASTERFULLY ON HIS CHANNEL.
YOU1000000130_S0000005	BY ALL ACCOUNTS, HENRY FORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FARMER. BORN IN MICHIGAN BARELY TWENTY YEARS AFTER IT HAD BECOME A STATE,
YOU1000000130_S0000006	HENRY GREW UP AT A TIME WHEN FARMING WAS SLOW, EXHAUSTING, AND MANUAL, WHICH IS WHY UNSURPRISINGLY HE CAME TO HATE IT WITH A PASSION. BUT WHEREAS MOST PEOPLE AT THE TIME DIDN'T HAVE THE FORTUNE TO ESCAPE WHAT THEY WERE BORN INTO,
YOU1000000130_S0000007	HENRY WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY. YOU SEE, THE VILLAGE HE WAS BORN INTO WAS JUST 8 MILES WEST OF DETROIT, WHICH WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING AN INDUSTRIAL CENTER THANKS TO THE STEAM ENGINE.
YOU1000000130_S0000008	EARLY ON IN HIS CHILDHOOD HENRY ENCOUNTERED TECHNOLOGY WHICH FEW CHILDREN HIS AGE COULD PLAY AROUND WITH.
YOU1000000130_S0000009	HE'D TINKER WITH THE WATCHES OF HIS BETTER OFF NEIGHBORS AND BY THE TIME HE WAS 12 HE COULD NOT JUST TAKE THEM APART, BUT ALSO PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER AND REPAIR THEM.
YOU1000000130_S0000010	HIS INTEREST GREW INTO AN OBSESSION WHEN HE GOT TO OBSERVE A WORKING STEAM ENGINE FIRST HAND WHILE ON A SCHOOL TRIP TO ONE OF THE RAIL COMPANIES IN DETROIT.
YOU1000000130_S0000011	BY THE TIME HENRY HAD BECOME A TEENAGER, THE STEAM ENGINE WAS ALREADY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE FARMING COMMUNITY. COAL POWERED THRESHING MACHINES AND SAWMILLS WERE BECOMING COMMON SIGHT AND HENRY WAS LEARNING HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW TO FIX THEM.
YOU1000000130_S0000012	AT THE AGE OF 16 HE MADE A BIG LEAP FORWARD WHEN AGAINST HIS FATHER'S WISHES HE LEFT HIS VILLAGE TO GO WORK IN DETROIT, WHERE ANY YOUNG MECHANIC COULD EASILY FIND VERY LUCRATIVE EMPLOYMENT.
YOU1000000130_S0000013	INDUSTRY IN DETROIT WAS BOOMING AND IT HAD BEEN DOING SO FOR CLOSE TO FIVE DECADES. IN 1825 A CANAL HAD BEEN DUG, CONNECTING THE HUDSON RIVER TO THE GREAT LAKES, WHICH AT THE TIME WERE EFFECTIVELY THEIR WESTERN FRONTIER.
YOU1000000130_S0000014	ALL THE UNTAPPED RESOURCES THAT HAD NO WAY OF GETTING OUT COULD SUDDENLY BE MOVED BY STEAMBOAT TO NEW YORK AND IN THE SPAN OF JUST 50 YEARS DETROIT'S POPULATION INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF 10.
YOU1000000130_S0000015	WITH VAST MINES IN THE NORTH PRODUCING COPPER AND IRON AND LUMBER MILLS OPENING UP VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE.
YOU1000000130_S0000016	ALL THIS METAL AND WOOD SUSTAINED CLOSE TO A THOUSAND COMPANIES IN DETROIT ALONE, INCLUDING THE ONES IN WHICH HENRY WOULD WORK AT OVER THE COURSE OF THE 1880S.
YOU1000000130_S0000017	IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT HENRY BY CHANCE LEARNED ABOUT THE GAS ENGINE FROM A BRITISH MAGAZINE. IT WAS BEING PRODUCED IN SMALL NUMBERS BY A GERMAN ENGINEER, NICHOLAS OTTO.
YOU1000000130_S0000018	AND IT WAS GAINING SOME TRACTION IN EUROPE, BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN AMERICA. HENRY WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON SUCH AN ENGINE HIMSELF IN 1889 AND HE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD.
YOU1000000130_S0000019	BECAUSE IT DID NOT USE STEAM, THE ENGINE WAS MUCH LIGHTER AND GOT RID OF THE HEAVY BOILER AND ALL THE WATER IN IT BECAUSE IT DID ALL THE COMBUSTION INTERNALLY, A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS.
YOU1000000130_S0000020	THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE GAS ENGINE TO START QUICKLY, WHEREAS STEAM ENGINES OF THE TIME NEEDED AS MUCH AS 30 MINUTES TO HEAT UP THE WATER AND GENERATE ENOUGH STEAM TO START WORKING. THE GAS ENGINE WAS AN INNOVATION HENRY FELL IN LOVE WITH.
YOU1000000130_S0000021	BUT IT WAS ALSO ONE HE DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND. AFTER ALL, HE HAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH STEAM AND METAL, BUT ALMOST NONE WITH ELECTRICITY, AND THE GAS ENGINE WAS FIRED BY AN ELECTRIC SPARK.
YOU1000000130_S0000022	TO OBTAIN THIS MISSING KNOWLEDGE, HENRY WENT TO WORK FOR THE LOCAL BRANCH OF THE EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANY.
YOU1000000130_S0000023	IT WAS GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR OVER A THOUSAND HOMES IN DETROIT AND IT WAS DOING SO BY USING STEAM ENGINES, SO HENRY WAS A NATURAL HIRE FOR THEM. WHENEVER THE ENGINES BROKE, HENRY HAD TO FIX THEM, BUT WHENEVER THEY WERE WORKING,
YOU1000000130_S0000024	HE WAS FREE TO DO AS HE WISHED. IT WAS THE PERFECT JOB THAT ALLOWED HIM TO SPEND HIS DAYS EXPERIMENTING WITH GAS ENGINES. IN 1893, WHEN HENRY HAD ALREADY BEEN PROMOTED TO CHIEF ENGINEER AT EDISON,
YOU1000000130_S0000025	HE CREATED HIS FIRST WORKING GAS ENGINE. THE IDEA OF USING THE GAS ENGINE TO CREATE A HORSELESS CARRIAGE HAD BEEN AROUND IN HENRY'S MIND SINCE HE FIRST LAID EYES ON ONE, BUT ACTUALLY MAKING THAT IDEA A REALITY WOULD TAKE YEARS OF WORK.
YOU1000000130_S0000026	BUILDING A CAR IN A WORLD WITH NO CAR PARTS WASN'T EASY, AND HENRY HAD TO FIGURE OUT EVERY DETAIL THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR. IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS OF CONSTANT EFFORT TO PRODUCE THIS, THE QUADRICYCLE.
YOU1000000130_S0000027	A SIMPLE FRAME WITH AN ENGINE POWERED BY ETHANOL AND FOUR BICYCLE WHEELS MOUNTED ONTO IT. IT HAD ONLY TWO GEARS, AND NEITHER ONE WAS FOR GOING IN REVERSE, BUT WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT IT HAD NO COOLING SYSTEM TO SPEAK OF.
YOU1000000130_S0000028	THUS MAKING OVERHEATING A CONSTANT ISSUE. IN ITS FIRST YEAR, HENRY MADE NUMEROUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE QUADRICYCLE, MOST NOTABLY ADDING A COOLING SYSTEM AND BY THE TIME HE SOLD IT IN 1897 FOR $200,
YOU1000000130_S0000029	HE HAD DRIVEN A THOUSAND MILES IN IT. HENRY BUILT A SECOND QUADRICYCLE AND THEN A THIRD ONE, ALWAYS IMPROVING THE DESIGN, BEFORE FINALLY FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN 1899 TO START HIS OWN COMPANY.
YOU1000000130_S0000031	CAPITALIZED AT $150,000, THE DETROIT AUTOMOBILE COMPANY WAS A VERY AMBITIOUS VENTURE. MANY OF THE DETROIT ELITE INVESTED IN IT, INCLUDING HENRY'S FRIENDS FROM THE EDISON COMPANY,
YOU1000000130_S0000032	AND EVERYONE WAS EAGER TO SEE WHAT HENRY COULD CREATE WITH PROPER CAPITAL. HENRY'S PLAN WAS VERY CLEVER, SINCE HE PERSONALLY KNEW MANY OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN DETROIT BY THAT POINT, HE'D TRY TO BUILD AN AUTOMOBILE THEY COULD USE IN THEIR BUSINESSES.
YOU1000000130_S0000033	HE LEASED A FACTORY AND PLANNED TO HIRE A HUNDRED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS NEW DELIVERY WAGON, AS HE CALLED IT. BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT BUILDING SUCH COMPLEX MACHINES IN HIGH NUMBERS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN HENRY IMAGINED.
YOU1000000130_S0000034	THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PARTS USED IN THE MAKING OF THE DELIVERY WAGON WERE PRODUCED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND EVERY TIME A SINGLE DELIVERY WAS LATE, THE ENTIRE FACTORY WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO STOP WORKING.
YOU1000000130_S0000035	THE FIRST DELIVERY WAGON TOOK SIX MONTHS TO PRODUCE, AND NO MORE THAN 20 WERE MADE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTENCE. BY THE END OF 1902, THE OTHER SHAREHOLDERS WERE SICK OF HENRY'S LACK OF PROGRESS,
YOU1000000130_S0000036	AND ACTUALLY VOTED TO GET RID OF HIM. NOW, BECAUSE HENRY HELD ONLY 15% OF THE COMPANY, HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO COMPLY.
YOU1000000130_S0000037	AND, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE MAN WHO TOOK OVER THE DETROIT AUTOMOBILE COMPANY WOULD EVENTUALLY TRANSFORM IT INTO CADILLAC. BUT THAT'S A STORY FOR A DIFFERENT TIME. WHAT MATTERS IS THAT HENRY WAS PUSHED OUT OF HIS OWN COMPANY.
YOU1000000130_S0000038	AND HAD ONLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HIS NAME. IT WAS BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND THIS TIME HENRY WOULD TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH. INSTEAD OF TARGETING BUSINESSES WITH EXPENSIVE MACHINES, HENRY WOULD DESIGN A VEHICLE TO BE USED BY THE AVERAGE MAN.
YOU1000000130_S0000039	YOU SEE, AT THE TIME VIRTUALLY ALL CARS WERE HIGH TICKET ITEMS. THEY WERE MOSTLY MADE BY SKILLED CRAFTSMEN, ONE AT A TIME, AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WERE DESIGNED FOR RACING, WHICH WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING A FAVORITE AMERICAN ACTIVITY.
YOU1000000130_S0000040	HENRY ENVISIONED TURNING THE CAR FROM A STATUS SYMBOL INTO A COMMODITY, BUT DOING THAT WOULD NOT BE EASY AND IN FACT IT TOOK HENRY 20 DIFFERENT DESIGN ITERATIONS BEFORE HE FINALLY GOT ONE THAT WORKED.
YOU1000000130_S0000041	HENRY LABELED HIS FIRST DESIGN AS THE MODEL A AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ALPHABET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, SUSTAINED BY CAPITAL FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
YOU1000000130_S0000042	BUT WHAT CHANGED THE MOST DURING THIS TIME IS NOT THE CAR ITSELF, BUT THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. HENRY LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A RELIABLE SUPPLY CHAIN WHEN HIS FIRST COMPANY FAILED, WHICH IS WHY THIS TIME AROUND
YOU1000000130_S0000043	HE TRIED GETTING AS MANY PARTS AS POSSIBLE FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER. THE ONE HE CHOSE WILL PROBABLY SOUND FAMILIAR, THE DODGE BROTHERS COMPANY, A MACHINE SHOP IN DETROIT THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY EVOLVE INTO THE EPONYMOUS AMERICAN BRAND.
YOU1000000130_S0000044	THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER OF ALL, HOWEVER, WAS HENRY'S CHANCE VISIT TO A SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN CHICAGO. HE SAW THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING, A DISASSEMBLY LINE, SO TO SPEAK, WHERE MULTIPLE WORKERS WOULD PROCESS CARCASSES MOVING DOWN A LINE.
YOU1000000130_S0000045	HENRY FIGURED HE COULD USE THE SAME PROCESS BUT IN REVERSE, AN ASSEMBLY LINE. USING THE MONEY HE HAD SAVED FROM SOME OF HIS EARLIER MODELS, WHICH WERE ALSO ASSEMBLED BY THE DODGE BROTHERS,
YOU1000000130_S0000046	HENRY WAS ABLE TO BUILD A FACTORY OF HIS OWN IN 1904 WHERE HE COULD EXPERIMENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS. BY 1905, THE FORD FACTORY EMPLOYED OVER 300 PEOPLE THAT BUILT 25 CARS A DAY
YOU1000000130_S0000047	BUT HENRY STILL HADN'T FIGURED EVERYTHING OUT. HE WAS PRODUCING MULTIPLE DIFFERENT MODELS AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM PROPERLY USING AN ASSEMBLY LINE.
YOU1000000130_S0000048	NEVERTHELESS, THERE WAS A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME. THE AFFORDABLE MODEL N, CREATED IN 1906, BECAME THE BEST SELLING CAR IN THE US AND FORD BECAME THE BIGGEST CAR PRODUCER IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000130_S0000049	IT IS ACTUALLY DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MODEL THAT HENRY WOULD FIRST USE THE ASSEMBLY LINE PROCESS TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ASSEMBLE SOME OF HIS CARS.
YOU1000000130_S0000050	IT WASN'T A FULL MOVING ASSEMBLY LINE, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THIS EXPERIMENT INCREASED PRODUCTION BY A FACTOR OF 5 IN THE SAME FACTORY. LOGISTICS, OF COURSE, WAS ANOTHER BIG PART OF HENRY'S SUCCESS.
YOU1000000130_S0000051	IN 1905 HE CREATED THE FORD MANUFACTURING COMPANY, COMPLETE WITH ITS OWN FACTORY, TO START MAKING THE ENGINES AND TRANSMISSIONS OF HENRY'S CARS TO FURTHER ELIMINATE ANY POSSIBILITY OF DELAYS.
YOU1000000130_S0000052	BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN HENRY'S SUCCESS CAME FROM PERHAPS THE MOST UNEXPECTED PLACE. PERU. NOW THIS IS A STORY YOU'RE NOT GONNA HEAR ANYWHERE ELSE, SO LISTEN CAREFULLY.
YOU1000000130_S0000053	IN 1907 HENRY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A HEAT TREATMENT PLANT TO PRODUCE VANADIUM STEEL.
YOU1000000130_S0000054	THIS ALLOY WAS NEW TO AMERICA. IN FACT, FEW FURNACES IN THE US COULD EVEN REACH THE TEMPERATURE NEEDED TO MANUFACTURE IT. THE DIFFICULTY IN PRODUCING IT, HOWEVER, WAS WORTH IT.
YOU1000000130_S0000055	BECAUSE VANADIUM STEEL WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS STRONG AS REGULAR STEEL WHILE ACTUALLY BEING LIGHTER. NOW, AT THE TIME, VANADIUM METALLURGY WAS CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH.
YOU1000000130_S0000056	BUT HENRY HAD AN EXTREMELY LUCKY CONNECTION. HE WAS FRIENDS WITH THE TWO BROTHERS WHO OWNED THE 1 VANADIUM MINE IN PERU, PRODUCING 92% OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY.
YOU1000000130_S0000057	JOSEPH AND JAMES FLANNERY HAD COMMERCIALIZED VANADIUM STEEL IN EUROPE AND IN THE US BY SELLING IT TO RAIL COMPANIES, BUT THEIR PERUVIAN MINE WAS PRODUCING SO MUCH VANADIUM THAT THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT.
YOU1000000130_S0000059	THEY SOLD VANADIUM STEEL TO THE US GOVERNMENT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PANAMA CANAL, BUT EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, SO WHEN THEY MET HENRY IN 1906, THEY IMMEDIATELY MADE HIM AN OFFER.
YOU1000000130_S0000060	THEY WOULD HELP HIM TRANSITION HIS ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO USE VANADIUM STEEL. IT WAS THEIR CHIEF ENGINEER THAT BUILT THE HEAT TREATMENT PLANT FOR HENRY IN 1907,
YOU1000000130_S0000061	AND IT WAS THEIR COMPANY THAT SUPPLIED FORD WITH ALL THE VANADIUM IT NEEDED FOR ITS CARS. THE FIRST FORD CAR DESIGNED WITH VANADIUM STEEL WAS THE MODEL T IN 1908 AND IT WAS THIS ALLOY THAT ACTUALLY MADE IT SUCCESSFUL.
YOU1000000130_S0000062	IT WASN'T THE CHEAPEST CAR HENRY HAD MADE, THE MODEL N AND ITS UPSCALE VERSIONS WERE ACTUALLY CHEAPER, BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE, BECAUSE IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST CAR BUILT AT THE TIME, MUCH STRONGER THAN ANY COMPETITOR.
YOU1000000130_S0000063	THE SHEER DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY WAS THE ONLY MARKETING HENRY NEEDED AND WITHIN WEEKS OF THE MODEL T'S RELEASE, FORD RECEIVED 25,000 ORDERS FOR IT.
YOU1000000130_S0000064	EVEN THOUGH IT MANAGED TO PRODUCE ONLY 17,000 UNITS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF 1909. HENRY REALIZED JUST HOW BIG OF A DEAL THE MODEL T WAS, WHICH IS WHY HE BUILT A SECOND FACTORY IN 1910.
YOU1000000130_S0000065	AND IT IS THERE THAT HE WOULD PERFECT THE MOVING ASSEMBLY LINE IN 1913. DURING THIS PERIOD PRODUCTION WOULD DOUBLE EVERY YEAR. IN 1910 HE BUILT 20,000 MODEL TS
YOU1000000130_S0000066	AND JUST SIX YEARS LATER HE WAS BUILDING OVER HALF A MILLION. AT THE SAME TIME, HENRY ADOPTED ANOTHER BRILLIANT STRATEGY, HE WAS CONSTANTLY REDUCING THE PRICE OF HIS CARS TO FURTHER INCREASE HIS MARKET SHARE.
YOU1000000130_S0000067	IN FACT, DURING THESE SIX YEARS, HE CUT THE MODEL TS PRICE BY MORE THAN HALF. BY 1918, HALF OF ALL CARS IN AMERICA WERE MODEL TS AND THIS TREND WOULD CONTINUE WELL INTO THE 1920S.
YOU1000000130_S0000068	HENRY HAD BEGUN A NEW AGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY, THE AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE, AND IT WAS HIS COMPANY THAT WOULD TOTALLY DOMINATE IT IN ITS FIRST TWO DECADES.
YOU1000000130_S0000069	IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THE 1920S THAT THE REST OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAUGHT UP TO HENRY, BUT AT THAT POINT HE WAS ALREADY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN ALIVE.
YOU1000000130_S0000070	IN 1922 HE ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WHERE PARTS OF THIS VIDEO CAME FROM AND WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE AS PART OF YOUR 30 DAY FREE TRIAL OF AUDIBLE.
YOU1000000130_S0000071	IN HIS BOOK, HENRY NOT ONLY RECOUNTS HIS EXPERIENCES IN A VERY ELOQUENT FASHION, HE ALSO SHARES PLENTY OF BUSINESS ADVICE THAT IS ACTUALLY STILL RELEVANT TODAY.
YOU1000000130_S0000072	YOU SHOULD VISIT AUDIBLE.COM SLASH BUSINESSCASUAL OR YOU CAN TEXT BUSINESSCASUAL TO 500 500 TO GET STARTED WITH AUDIBLE, WHO HAVE THE BIGGEST COLLECTION OF AUDIOBOOKS IN THE WORLD.

YOU1000000131_S0000000	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WEALTHIEST MEN ALIVE TODAY, TOPPING THE CHARTS ARE TECH BILLIONAIRES LIKE JEFF BEZOS AND BILL GATES. BUT ACTUALLY, THE WEALTHIEST BUSINESSMAN TO HAVE EVER LIVED DIED ALMOST A CENTURY AGO.
YOU1000000131_S0000001	IN TODAY'S VIDEO, WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A BUSINESS EMPIRE SO VAST THAT EVEN AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS, NO MAN HAS MANAGED TO OVERTAKE ITS FOUNDER. THIS IS THE HISTORY OF STANDARD OIL.
YOU1000000131_S0000003	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB. VISIT THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION TO LEARN ABOUT THE AWESOME DEAL THEY'RE OFFERING.
YOU1000000131_S0000005	THE ORIGINS OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OIL MONOPOLY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HUMBLE. IT ALL STARTS IN 1839 WITH THE BIRTH OF JOHN ROCKEFELLER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A TRAVELING MERCHANT.
YOU1000000131_S0000006	WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS A BOTANIC PHYSICIAN BUT IN REALITY WAS SELLING THE 19TH CENTURY EQUIVALENT OF HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE.
YOU1000000131_S0000007	HE WOULD SPEND WEEKS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN FACT WOULD HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, WHO HE DECIDED TO BRING BACK HOME TO HIS WIFE
YOU1000000131_S0000008	SO THEY COULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER. IN THIS VERY CONFUSING HOUSEHOLD, JOHN WOULD GROW UP LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE PEOPLE FOR THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY PENNY HE GOT. HIS FAMILY WOULD RARELY STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG,
YOU1000000131_S0000009	AND JOHN WOULD LIVE THIS NOMADIC LIFESTYLE EVER SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD. TO HELP HIS MOTHER, JOHN WOULD EARN ANY MONEY HE COULD BY RAISING TURKEYS OR DOING WORK FOR NEIGHBORS. HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PUT TO GOOD USE
YOU1000000131_S0000010	WHEN THE FAMILY MOVED TO CLEVELAND, OHIO IN 1854, WHERE HE GOT THE CHANCE TO ATTEND A PROPER SCHOOL. BUT LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, JOHN DROPPED OUT IN ORDER TO WORK AS A BOOKKEEPER AT A LOCAL PRODUCE BROKER. HE WOULD EARN 50 CENTS PER DAY.
YOU1000000131_S0000011	WHICH OBVIOUSLY WASN'T MUCH AT THE TIME, SO HE WOULD HELP OTHER COMPANIES ON THE SIDE. BUT AFTER TWO YEARS OF WORKING THERE HIS BOSSES REFUSED TO GIVE HIM A MEANINGFUL RAISE, SO HE DECIDED TO ONE UP THEM BY STARTING HIS OWN PRODUCE BROKERAGE.
YOU1000000131_S0000012	THANKS TO HIS GOOD REPUTATION, HE GOT A LOAN OF $4,000, WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A HUGE SUM. JOHN STARTED TRADING HAY, GRAIN AND VARIOUS MEATS AND IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE RECORDED SALES OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
YOU1000000131_S0000013	OF WHICH HE ONLY GOT A SMALL FRACTION AS COMMISSIONS, BUT STILL IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS. EVERY BANK IN CLEVELAND WAS BEGGING JOHN TO BORROW MONEY, AND HE WAS BARELY 18 YEARS OLD. BUT THEN IN 1859
YOU1000000131_S0000014	SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE FOREVER. JUST A HUNDRED MILES EAST OF CLEVELAND, THE FIRST AMERICAN OIL WELL HAD BEEN DISCOVERED. THIS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA OIL RUSH AND WITHIN A YEAR,
YOU1000000131_S0000015	4,500 BARRELS OF OIL WOULD BE PRODUCED. NOW, BACK THEN OIL WASN'T QUITE AS VALUABLE AS IT IS TODAY. GASOLINE CARS HADN'T BEEN INVENTED YET, BUT OIL COULD STILL BE PROCESSED INTO KEROSENE, WHICH PEOPLE WOULD THEN USE IN LAMPS.
YOU1000000131_S0000016	JOHN REALIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THE BIGGEST PROFITS TO BE HAD WEREN'T IN DRILLING FOR OIL, BUT IN REFINING IT. HE WITNESSED MANY PEOPLE GOING BUST BEFORE STRIKING OIL, SO HE KNEW THAT THE BUSINESS WAS TOO RISKY FOR HIM.
YOU1000000131_S0000017	INSTEAD, HE'D LET OTHERS GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF FINDING THE OIL AND HE WOULD JUST BUY IT OFF OF THEM. JOHN HAD TO WAIT UNTIL 1863 FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD A RAIL LINE CONNECTING THE PENNSYLVANIA OIL FIELDS TO CLEVELAND.
YOU1000000131_S0000018	BUT WHEN THAT LINE WAS BUILT, JOHN WAS READY FOR IT, WITH A LONG LINE OF PARTNERS AND BANKS READY TO BACK HIM UP. HE ALSO ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF SEASONED CHEMISTS AND ENGINEERS, WHO NOT ONLY OPTIMIZED THE REFINING PROCESS, BUT ALSO DISCOVERED VARIOUS USES
YOU1000000131_S0000019	FOR THE BYPRODUCTS OF REFINING PETROLEUM. YOU SEE, THE EARLY REFINERIES IN CLEVELAND COULD ONLY OPERATE AT ABOUT A 60% EFFICIENCY, BUT JOHN NOT ONLY INCREASED THAT PERCENTAGE, HE ALSO STARTED SELLING ALL THE BYPRODUCTS LIKE PARAFFIN WAX
YOU1000000131_S0000020	TAR, AND NAPHTHA. WITHIN TWO YEARS, THE ROCKEFELLER REFINERY WAS WORTH OVER $70,000 AND WAS AMONG THE LARGEST IN CLEVELAND. BUT JOHN WASN'T DONE.
YOU1000000131_S0000021	IN 1865 THERE WERE 26 COMPETING REFINERIES, BUT WITHIN FIVE YEARS JOHN HAD ACQUIRED ALL BUT FOUR OF THEM.
YOU1000000131_S0000023	BY THIS POINT HIS BUSINESS WAS GETTING TOO BIG TO HANDLE AS A PARTNERSHIP, SO IN 1870 HE INCORPORATED AS STANDARD OIL OF OHIO. TO CONVINCE THE FEW REMAINING COMPETITORS IN CLEVELAND, JOHN WOULD SIMPLY INVITE THEM OVER AND SHOW THEM HIS BOOKS.
YOU1000000131_S0000024	REVEALING THAT HE COULD OPERATE AT A LOSS FAR LONGER THAN THEY COULD STAY SOLVENT. IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOOD BUYOUT PRICE, JOHN WOULD OFFER HIS COMPETITORS POSITIONS IN HIS OWN COMPANY, THUS PLACING THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN THE INDUSTRY UNDER HIS CONTROL.
YOU1000000131_S0000025	OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE WOULD GIVE UP IMMEDIATELY, AND OVER TIME, JOHN ERODED THE PRICE OF OIL AND KEROSENE, SOMETIMES BY AS MUCH AS 80% IN ORDER TO STRANGLE COMPETITORS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS STRATEGY WORKED.
YOU1000000131_S0000026	BY 1880 HE HAD ACQUIRED REFINERIES ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN US AND WAS REFINING OVER 90% OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY'S OIL PRODUCTION. AT THIS POINT JOHN WAS SO POWERFUL THAT HE COULD INVITE THE OWNERS OF THE BIG RAIL COMPANIES
YOU1000000131_S0000027	AND PERSONALLY NEGOTIATE REBATES FOR USING THEIR TRAINS. BUT THIS PRACTICE OF NEGOTIATING BACKROOM DEALS REALLY GOT THE BUSINESS WORLD RILED UP. AT THE TIME, AND STILL KIND OF TODAY, MOST INDUSTRIAL GOODS WERE TRANSPORTED BY RAIL.
YOU1000000131_S0000028	AND MANY BIG INDUSTRIALISTS GOT WORRIED
YOU1000000131_S0000030	THAT JOHN'S ABUSE OF TRANSPORTATION REBATES COULD RESULT IN SIMILAR MONOPOLIZATION IN THEIR INDUSTRIES.
YOU1000000131_S0000031	OVER THE NEXT DECADE, BUSINESSMEN, POLITICIANS, AND THE MEDIA WOULD ATTACK STANDARD OIL WITH INCREASING FEROCITY. LEGISLATORS IN OHIO BEGAN DRAFTING ANTITRUST REGULATIONS TO BRING DOWN ROCKEFELLER, BUT HE WAS ONE STEP AHEAD.
YOU1000000131_S0000032	IN 1882 HE REINCORPORATED IN NEW JERSEY, THIS TIME CREATING THE STANDARD OIL TRUST, WHICH IN TURN HELD STAKES IN OVER 40 LOCAL COMPANIES.
YOU1000000131_S0000033	THEN, TO SHOWCASE HIS SUCCESS, JOHN BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE HEADQUARTERS FOR HIS COMPANY ON BROADWAY. THIS MOMENT WAS THE HIGH POINT OF ROCKEFELLER STANDARD OIL.
YOU1000000131_S0000034	HE OWNED 20,000 OIL WELLS, 4,000 MILES OF PIPELINE AND EMPLOYED OVER 100,000 PEOPLE. BUT HIS GRIP ON THE OIL INDUSTRY WAS LOOSENING, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD.
YOU1000000131_S0000035	MASSIVE OIL DEPOSITS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN RUSSIA AND IN ASIA AND WERE BEING DEVELOPED BY THE ROTHSCHILD FAMILY, WHICH SPARED NO EFFORT IN GETTING THAT OIL TO AMERICA.
YOU1000000131_S0000036	WORSE YET, IN 1890 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT, WHICH OFFICIALLY GAVE POLITICIANS THE TEETH TO GO AFTER THE STANDARD OIL TRUST ITSELF.
YOU1000000131_S0000037	OF COURSE, THE COMPLEX LEGAL STRUCTURE BEHIND ALL THE COMPANIES WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO INVESTIGATE, WHICH IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T ACTUALLY BREAK UP STANDARD OIL UNTIL 1911.
YOU1000000131_S0000038	BY THAT POINT, HOWEVER, JOHN ROCKEFELLER HAD ALREADY CASHED IN AND WAS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MANAGING THE COMPANY. IN THE FINAL 20 YEARS OF HIS COMPANY'S EXISTENCE, IT HAD PAID OUT OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN DIVIDENDS.
YOU1000000131_S0000039	BY SOME ESTIMATES, THE TRUE WORTH OF STANDARD OIL AT ITS PEAK WAS $1 TRILLION, SO THE BREAKUP DIDN'T REALLY COME AS A SURPRISE TO MOST PEOPLE. IN 1911, THE SUPREME COURT FOUND STANDARD OIL GUILTY OF ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES.
YOU1000000131_S0000040	AND BROKE THE COMPANY UP INTO 34 SEPARATE ENTITIES. OF COURSE, JOHN ROCKEFELLER KEPT HIS STAKE IN THOSE COMPANIES UNTIL HIS DEATH AND IN FACT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BREAKUP WAS THE MOST PROFITABLE EVENT IN HIS LIFE.
YOU1000000131_S0000041	YOU'LL SEE OVER TIME MANY OF THOSE COMPANIES MERGED BACK WITH ONE ANOTHER. TODAY, MOST OF THE STANDARD REMNANTS ARE PART OF EITHER EXXONMOBIL, CHEVRON OR BP, WHICH HAVE SINCE BECOME INCREDIBLY LARGE COMPANIES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.
YOU1000000131_S0000042	JOHN ROCKEFELLER'S OWNERSHIP OF THESE SUCCESSOR COMPANIES MADE HIM THE RICHEST BUSINESSMAN TO HAVE EVER LIVED WITH AN ESTIMATED NET WORTH OF $400 BILLION. EVEN TODAY NO ONE HAS BEATEN ROCKEFELLER IN THE LEADERBOARD.
YOU1000000131_S0000043	NOT EVEN JEFF BEZOS HIMSELF SEEMS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THAT. BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT JEFF BEZOS DOES HAVE THAT JOHN ROCKEFELLER NEVER DID, DESPITE ALL HIS MONEY, AND THAT IS ACCESS TO DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB.
YOU1000000131_S0000044	I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM, IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS MAN CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT LOOKING AND FEELING AT HIS VERY BEST. BUT GUESS WHAT? YOU TOO CAN EXPERIENCE THE SPLENDOR OF DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB'S DAILY ESSENTIALS STARTER SET.
YOU1000000131_S0000045	WHICH, BY THE WAY, NEW MEMBERS CAN GET FOR JUST $5. THAT SET INCLUDES SHAVE BUTTER, BODY WASH AND ONE WIPE CHARLIE'S BUTT WIPES TO REALLY MAKE YOU FEEL SPECIAL. AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, YOU ALSO GET THEIR EXECUTIVE RAZOR.
YOU1000000131_S0000046	SO REALLY YOU'RE GETTING A HECK OF A DEAL. VISIT DOLLARSHAVECLUB.COM SLASH BUSINESS CASUAL TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A CLUB SO PRESTIGIOUS THAT NOT EVEN JOHN ROCKEFELLER COULD GET IN.

YOU1000000131_S0000048	ANYHOW, WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS, AND UNTIL THEN, STAY SMART.
YOU1000000132_S0000000	THE ROTHSCHILD BANKING DYNASTY. EASILY ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST FAMILIES IN HISTORY, BUT ALSO THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES.
YOU1000000132_S0000001	THE VAST AND SHROUDED WEALTH OF THE WRATHSHIELDS HAS ENDURED FOR GENERATIONS AND HAS UNSURPRISINGLY MADE IT HARD TO TELL WHAT IS FACT AND WHAT IS FICTION.
YOU1000000132_S0000002	IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THIS FAMOUS JEWISH FAMILY TO SEE HOW THEY MANAGED TO BUILD ONE OF THE GREATEST FORTUNES IN HISTORY AT A TIME OF RAMPANT ANTI SEMITISM.
YOU1000000132_S0000003	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY SKILLSHARE, WITH WHOM I'VE PARTNERED TO MAKE A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS ON THE STOCK MARKET, WHICH YOU CAN WATCH FOR FREE BY USING THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION. OUR STORY BEGINS IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE.
YOU1000000132_S0000004	BY THE 10TH CENTURY MOST OF EUROPE WAS UNDER THE DOMAIN OF CHRISTIANITY. POLITICAL POWER WAS INVARIABLY TIED TO RELIGION, WHICH MADE BEING A NON CHRISTIAN VERY UNFAVORABLE. PERHAPS THE BIGGEST VICTIMS OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE JEWS.
YOU1000000132_S0000005	HAVING NO HOME STATE OF THEIR OWN TO FALL BACK TO, THE JEWS WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EUROPE, AND MANY OF THEM SETTLED IN THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE.
YOU1000000132_S0000006	THIS VAST MULTI ETHNIC STATE CONTAINED MODERN DAY GERMANY, AND LIKE THE REST OF EUROPE, IT TOO WASN'T HAPPY TO HARBOR THE JEWS.
YOU1000000132_S0000007	IN MANY CITIES THE JEWS WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOODS, IN WHAT WE NOW CALL GHETTOS, AND THE CITY OF FRANKFURT WAS NO EXCEPTION.
YOU1000000132_S0000008	FROM 1462 ONWARDS IT CONFINED ALL THE JEWS IN THE CITY TO A SINGLE NARROW STREET OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS. THAT STREET CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE JUDENGASSE, OR THE JEWISH ALLEY, AND IT WAS MADE UP OF NUMEROUS TIGHTLY PACKED HOUSES.
YOU1000000132_S0000009	BACK THEN, THE BUILDINGS WEREN'T DISTINGUISHED BY NUMBERS, BUT BY SIGNS. ONE BUILDING COULD BE THE HOUSE OF THE SHIP, FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE ANOTHER COULD BE THE HOUSE OF THE GOLDEN STONE. THE SIGN ON ONE OF THOSE HOUSES WAS A RED SHIELD.
YOU1000000132_S0000010	OR RATHSCHILD IN GERMAN, AND THE FAMILY LIVING IN THE HOUSE HAD GONE BY THE SAME NAME SINCE AT LEAST 1528. LIKE MOST JEWISH FAMILIES AT THE TIME, THE RATHSCHILDS WERE INVOLVED IN FINANCE.
YOU1000000132_S0000011	YOU SEE, IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE, CHRISTIANITY FORBADE ANYONE FROM LENDING MONEY WITH INTEREST, LEAVING THIS OTHERWISE PROFITABLE BUSINESS INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS. EXPERIENCE WITH MONEY LENDING, AND BY EXTENSION ANYTHING RELATING TO FINANCE, WAS PASSED DOWN GENERATIONS.
YOU1000000132_S0000012	AND ROTHSCHILDS WERE NO EXCEPTION. THEY SPECIALIZED IN EXCHANGING CURRENCIES AND TRADING COLLECTIBLE COINS, AND THE BEST ONE OF THEM ALL WAS MEYER ROTHSCHILD. HE TOOK UP THE FAMILY BUSINESS IN 1763 AND HIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF COINS
YOU1000000132_S0000013	ATTRACTED THE WEALTHIEST ARISTOCRATS IN THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. AMONG THEM WAS CROWN PRINCE WILHELM OF HESSE. THE PRINCE MET MEYER IN 1769 AND QUICKLY LEARNED TO TRUST HIM WITH ALL MATTERS RELATING NOT JUST TO COLLECTIBLE COINS,
YOU1000000132_S0000014	BUT ANYTHING FINANCIAL. WHEN WILHELM CAME INTO POWER AS WILHELM IX OF HESSE IN 1785, HE HIRED MEYER TO MANAGE HIS FINANCES AS HIS HOFJUDE, OR COURT JEW. NOW KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS A COMMON ARRANGEMENT IN CENTRAL EUROPE.
YOU1000000132_S0000015	THE NOBILITY WOULD OUTSOURCE THEIR FINANCES TO JEWS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROTECTION, MONEY, AND SOMETIMES EVEN ACTUAL NOBLE TITLES. MEYER OVERSAW THE TAXES COLLECTED IN WILHELM'S LANDS AND HAD TO KEEP HIS MONEY SAFE.
YOU1000000132_S0000016	A TASK THAT BECAME VERY DIFFICULT IN 1806. THAT IS THE YEAR WHEN NAPOLEON INVADED HESSE, DRIVING WILHELM INTO EXILE AND PUTTING HIS FORTUNE AT RISK. BUT MEYER WAS SMART AND HE WAS READY FOR NAPOLEON.
YOU1000000132_S0000017	IN 1798 HE HAD SENT ONE OF HIS FIVE SONS, NATHAN ROTHSCHILD, TO LONDON TO START A CURRENCY BUSINESS SIMILAR TO HIS FATHER'S. WITH THIS FOUNDATION IN PLACE, MEYER HAD NO TROUBLE MOVING WILHELM'S FORTUNE TO LONDON
YOU1000000132_S0000018	WHERE HE THEN LOANED IT OUT TO THE BRITISH CROWN. IN ESSENCE, WILHELM WAS FUNDING THE BRITISH TO FIGHT NAPOLEON IN ORDER TO RESTORE HIS POWER. NOW MEYER DIED IN 1812, LEAVING WILHELM'S FORTUNE AND THE ROTHSCHILD LEGACY IN THE HANDS OF NATHAN.
YOU1000000132_S0000019	HE REMAINED IN LONDON, WHILE HIS ELDEST BROTHER TOOK OVER THE ORIGINAL FRANKFURT BUSINESS. MEANWHILE, THE THREE REMAINING BROTHERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EUROPE, ESTABLISHING BRANCHES IN IMPORTANT EUROPEAN CAPITALS.
YOU1000000132_S0000020	DESPITE THE DISTANCE, THE BROTHERS APPLIED A UNIFIED STRATEGY. THEY WOULD LOAN OUT THEIR MONEY TO THE ARISTOCRACY AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE BROTHER IN FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, BECAME THE BANKER OF LEOPOLD I OF BELGIUM.
YOU1000000132_S0000021	WHILE THE ONE IN VIENNA WOULD LEND MONEY TO THE LAST HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR, FRANCIS II. IN 1818 HE WOULD GRANT ALL FIVE BROTHERS THE NOBLE TITLE OF BARON, FINALLY ELEVATING THE ROTHSCHILDS TO NOBILITY.
YOU1000000132_S0000022	THROUGHOUT THE NEXT DECADES, WHENEVER A EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSED AND WAS REPLACED, IT WAS THE ROTHSCHILDS WHO WERE FIRST IN LINE TO PROVIDE LOANS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1830 OR AFTER THE FALL OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE.
YOU1000000132_S0000023	THE LOANING BUSINESS WAS IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL. THE PARIS BRANCH, FOR EXAMPLE, GREW FROM THE EQUIVALENT OF $5 MILLION IN 1820 TO OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN 1850.
YOU1000000132_S0000024	IN ESSENCE, THE FIVE ROTHSCHILD BANKING FAMILIES BACK THEN PROVIDED THE SAME SERVICE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND PROVIDES TODAY. THEY STABILIZED MAJOR CURRENCIES AND PROVIDED LOANS TO GOVERNMENTS, DOING BOTH AT A GREAT PROFIT.
YOU1000000132_S0000026	OF COURSE, THROUGHOUT THE 19TH CENTURY, THE FIVE BRANCHES ALSO MADE MANY PRIVATE INVESTMENTS BEYOND THEIR GOVERNMENT LOANS. IN 1868 THEY PURCHASED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE WINE ESTATES IN FRANCE.
YOU1000000132_S0000027	IN 1875 THEY ACQUIRED A MINORITY STAKE IN THE SUEZ CANAL FROM EGYPT, WHILE IN 1883 THEY FUNDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIRST MAJOR OIL WELL IN THE OLD WORLD, CHALLENGING THE ROCKEFELLER MONOPOLY IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000132_S0000028	THEY ALSO BECAME MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS IN THE DIAMOND MONOPOLY OF DE BEERS AND IN RIO TINTO, ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST MINING COMPANIES. BUT DURING THE 20TH CENTURY, THE NEWER GENERATIONS OF THE FIVE ROTHSCHILD FAMILIES MADE FEWER AND FEWER SUCCESSFUL MOVES.
YOU1000000132_S0000029	IN 1900, THE BRANCH IN NAPLES ACTUALLY BECAME EXTINCT WHEN THE LAST MALE HEIR DIED WITHOUT CHILDREN, LEAVING HIS FORTUNE TO THE BRANCH IN PARIS. A SOMEWHAT AMUSING FATE BEFELL THE BRANCH IN GERMANY.
YOU1000000132_S0000030	THERE, THE TWO ROTHSCHILD HEIRS HAD ELEVEN GIRLS AND NOT A SINGLE BOY, SPLITTING UP THE FORTUNE AND DISINTEGRATING ITS POWER. THE ROTHSCHILD BRANCH IN AUSTRIA WAS DOING WELL, UNTIL HITLER CAME TO POWER OF COURSE.
YOU1000000132_S0000031	WHEN NAZI GERMANY ANNEXED AUSTRIA IN 1938, THE ROTHSCHILDS HAD TO SELL THEIR BANKING OPERATION FOR A FRACTION OF ITS TRUE WORTH. MOST OF THEM ESCAPED WITH WHATEVER LIQUID ASSETS THEY HAD, BUT AT LEAST ONE WAS CAPTURED ON HIS WAY OUT.
YOU1000000132_S0000032	AND IN FACT HE WAS ONLY RELEASED AFTER PAYING THE LARGEST RANSOM IN HISTORY AT THE TIME, 21 MILLION DOLLARS. THE RANSOM EFFECTIVELY BANKRUPTED THE AUSTRIAN ROTHSCHILDS, WHILE THE NAZIS SEIZED ALL THEIR MANSIONS, BUSINESSES AND ART.
YOU1000000132_S0000033	A FEW YEARS LATER, EXACTLY THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE BRANCH IN PARIS. IN FACT, THE COLLECTIONS THEY HAD WERE SO EXQUISITE THAT HITLER AND HERMANN GÖRING PERSONALLY WENT THERE TO OBSERVE THEM AND TO PICK OUT WHAT THEY LIKED.
YOU1000000132_S0000034	THROUGH THE DETAILED INVENTORIES COMPILED BY THE NAZIS, WE KNOW THAT THEY SEIZED A TOTAL OF 5003 OBJECTS FROM THE ROTHSCHILD COLLECTIONS, AND A VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WERE NEVER RETURNED.
YOU1000000132_S0000035	THE FRENCH ROTHSCHILDS HAD SOME LUCK IN RESTORING THEIR BUSINESSES AFTER THE WAR, BUT THEN THE FRENCH SOCIALISTS NATIONALIZED THEIR BANK IN 1981. IN THE END, ONLY THE ENGLISH BRANCH SURVIVED THE 20TH CENTURY WITH ITS FORTUNE INTACT.
YOU1000000132_S0000036	ITS PATRIARCH DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY WAS SIR EVELYN ROTHSCHILD, WHO EVEN TODAY IS THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO QUEEN ELIZABETH. HE RETIRED FROM LEADERSHIP IN 2003, PASSING THE MANTLE OF PATRIARCH TO DAVID ROTHSCHILD.
YOU1000000132_S0000037	A MEMBER OF THE BRANCH IN PARIS, WHO THEN MERGED BOTH BRANCHES INTO A SINGLE ENTITY. HE ENSURED THE SECRECY OF THE FAMILY'S FORTUNE BY ESTABLISHING A COMPLEX NETWORK OF SHELL COMPANIES, STARTING OFF IN SWITZERLAND BUT ENDING GOD KNOWS WHERE.
YOU1000000132_S0000038	BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHILE THE 19TH CENTURY BANKING FAMILY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE RICHEST OF ITS DAY, TODAY THE ROTHSCHILDS ARE A SHADOW OF THEIR FORMER GLORY. IN FACT, IF YOU OPEN UP THE FORBES LIST OF BILLIONAIRES,
YOU1000000132_S0000039	THE FIRST ROTHSCHILD APPEARS AT NUMBER 822. THAT'S JEFF ROTHSCHILD, A MAN WHO ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ROTHSCHILD BANKING FAMILY.
YOU1000000132_S0000040	HE HAS NO BLOOD CONNECTION, HE JUST HAPPENS TO SHARE THE NAME, IN THE SAME WAY THAT TWO MEN BEARING THE FAMILY NAME GOLDMAN MIGHT NOT BE RELATED. THE FIRST ACTUAL ROTHSCHILD APPEARING ON THIS LIST IS ONLY AT NUMBER 1,284.
YOU1000000132_S0000041	AND HIS WEALTH IS TIED TO AN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY THAT MANAGES OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. SO IN THE END IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ONCE POWERFUL ROTHSCHILD FAMILY IS REALLY NOTHING MORE BUT A BLIP ON THE RADAR OF GLOBAL WEALTH.
YOU1000000132_S0000042	AND IT HONESTLY MAKES SENSE. STATISTICALLY, 90% OF WEALTHY FAMILIES LOSE THEIR FORTUNES BY THE THIRD GENERATION. IT'S JUST HARD TO BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE BORN INTO WEALTH AND HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MONEY.
YOU1000000132_S0000043	WHY BOTHER LEARNING HOW TO INVEST AND GROW YOUR WEALTH WHEN YOU CAN JUST SPEND WHATEVER GRANDPA LEFT YOU? WELL, IF YOU WANNA ESCAPE THIS VICIOUS CYCLE, OR AT LEAST KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FOR ANOTHER GENERATION,
YOU1000000132_S0000044	YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO LEARN THAT I MADE A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS ON SKILLSHARE ABOUT HOW THE STOCK MARKET WORKS. IN THESE SHORT ANIMATED CLIPS I COVER BASIC TOPICS LIKE WHAT IS A STOCK OR AN ETF OR WHY COMPANIES GO PUBLIC.
YOU1000000132_S0000045	UNLIKE THE ROTHSCHILDS OF THE 19TH CENTURY, THE FIRST 500 OF YOU CAN ACCESS ALL OF THIS INFORMATION RIGHT NOW FOR FREE BY REGISTERING FOR A 2 MONTH FREE TRIAL OF SKILLSHARE USING THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION.
YOU1000000132_S0000046	ONCE YOU'VE REGISTERED, SEARCH FOR INVESTING101 OR FOLLOW THE LINK I'VE CONVENIENTLY LEFT IN THE COMMENTS BELOW. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, SKILLSHARE IS THE BEST ONLINE LEARNING PLATFORM THAT HAS THOUSANDS OF VIDEOS ON REALLY ANY SKILL YOU CAN IMAGINE.
YOU1000000132_S0000047	WHICH NOW ALSO INCLUDES MY OWN SERIES. OF COURSE, WHEN YOU'RE DONE WATCHING, I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NEW SERIES, AND HEY, MAYBE ONE DAY YOU'LL CREATE A WEALTHY DYNASTY OF YOUR OWN, SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS CAN MAKE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000132_S0000048	ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. IF YOU LIKED THIS VIDEO MAKE SURE TO GIVE IT A THUMBS UP AND ALSO CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING. A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL MY PATRONS ON PATREON FOR SUPPORTING ME AND FOR MAKING BUSINESS CASUAL POSSIBLE.
YOU1000000132_S0000049	WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS, AND UNTIL THEN, STAY SMART.
YOU1000000133_S0000000	THE INTERNET HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY WE WATCH TELEVISION. GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN THE WHOLE FAMILY WOULD GATHER IN THE LIVING ROOM TO ENJOY THE EXACT SAME PROGRAM AS EVERYONE ELSE.
YOU1000000133_S0000001	TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED TO THE POINT WHERE WE'VE DUMPED THE OLD IMMOVABLE BOXES IN FAVOR OF OUR PHONES AND COMPUTERS. IN TODAY'S WORLD, YOU CAN WATCH WHATEVER YOU WANT, WHENEVER YOU WANT, ON DEMAND, STRAIGHT FROM THE INTERNET.
YOU1000000133_S0000002	WE ARE NOW IN THE AGE OF VIDEO ON DEMAND, AND SO THIS WEEK ON BEHIND THE BUSINESS WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT THE COMPANY THAT LIES AT THE HEART OF THIS RECENT REVOLUTION, NETFLIX.
YOU1000000133_S0000004	THE YEAR IS 1991 AND REED HASTINGS WAS GETTING READY TO START HIS FIRST COMPANY. HASTINGS WAS A RATHER UNUSUAL TECH ENTREPRENEUR.
YOU1000000133_S0000005	HE CAME FROM MINNESOTA AND AFTER GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE AND SERVING BRIEFLY IN THE MILITARY, HE DECIDED TO TRAVEL TO SWAZILAND WITH THE PEACE CORPS TO TEACH MATH.
YOU1000000133_S0000006	AFTER RETURNING TO THE US AND GETTING A MASTER'S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, HE AND TWO OF HIS FRIENDS STARTED A COMPANY IN 1991 CALLED PURE SOFTWARE. THE COMPANY SOLD A RANGE OF DEBUGGING TOOLS FOR UNIX OPERATING SYSTEMS AT A TIME WHEN THERE WERE FEW GOOD ONES ON THE MARKET.
YOU1000000133_S0000007	AND SO IT RAPIDLY BECAME A BIG PLAYER IN THE IT WORLD. IT DOUBLED ITS REVENUE EVERY YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS IN A ROW, AND IN 1996 IT WAS SOLD TO RATIONAL SOFTWARE FOR 700 MILLION DOLLARS.
YOU1000000133_S0000008	IN THE SPAN OF HALF A DECADE HASTINGS HAD BECOME A MILLIONAIRE.
YOU1000000133_S0000009	LIFE SEEMED GREAT, BUT IN 1997 HE SUFFERED AN INCONVENIENCE THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A WORLD CHANGER. HASTINGS HAD FORGOTTEN TO RETURN HIS VIDEO RENTAL OF APOLLO 13 AND AS A RESULT WAS SLAPPED WITH A $40 LATE FEE.
YOU1000000133_S0000010	HE WAS EMBARRASSED AND DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HIS WIFE, AND THAT GOT HIM THINKING OF A SOLUTION. NOT JUST A SOLUTION TO HIS OWN LATE FEE PROBLEM, BUT A SOLUTION TO EVERYONE'S PROBLEM. AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM OF FILM RENTAL THAT WOULD MAKE LATE FEES OBSOLETE.
YOU1000000133_S0000011	TOGETHER WITH A FRIEND OF HIS, ON AUGUST 29TH, 1997 IN SCOTTS VALLEY, CALIFORNIA, HASTINGS FOUNDED A BRAND NEW MOVIE RENTAL SERVICE CALLED NETFLIX, WITH THE IDEA OF MAILING DVDS TO PAYING CUSTOMERS.
YOU1000000133_S0000012	THE CREATION OF NETFLIX WAS ESSENTIALLY A BET ON THE DVD PLAYER. NOW, THE DVD PLAYER HAD BEEN INVENTED IN TAIWAN IN 1994 BY SONY, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL MARCH 1997 THAT ONE WAS FIRST SOLD IN THE US.
YOU1000000133_S0000013	BACK THEN, A PLAYER COST OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS, AND WHEN NETFLIX WAS FORMED, LESS THAN 1% OF AMERICANS ACTUALLY OWNED ONE.
YOU1000000133_S0000014	IN A MOVE THAT SEEMED INSANE AT THE TIME, HASTINGS GAMBLED EVERYTHING ON THE POTENTIAL OF DVD TECHNOLOGY TO REPLACE THE BULKIER, LOWER RESOLUTION VIDEOTAPE AS THE NATION'S FORMAT OF CHOICE.
YOU1000000133_S0000015	IN 1997 IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO RENT DVDS BECAUSE VERY FEW PLACES HAD ANY.
YOU1000000133_S0000016	AFTER TRYING OVER 200 DIFFERENT MAILING PACKAGES AND TESTING THEM OUT BY MAILING THEM TO HIMSELF, HASTINGS DISCOVERED THAT HE COULD SAFELY SHIP A DVD FOR THE SMALL COST OF A FIRST CLASS MAILSTAMP.
YOU1000000133_S0000017	THIS WAY NETFLIX COULD GUARANTEE THAT MOST TITLES WOULD BE IN STOCK, AND BY ENCLOSING A STAMPED RETURN MAILER, THEY COULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE OF FILM RENTAL AS CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE.
YOU1000000133_S0000018	THIS, ON APRIL 14TH, 1998, WITH 30 EMPLOYEES AND AN ASSORTMENT OF 925 TITLES, NETFLIX OPENED FOR BUSINESS.
YOU1000000133_S0000019	THEIR FIRST OFFER WAS FOR A 7 DAY RENTAL AT THE PRICE OF $4 PLUS A $2 SHIPPING FEE. THEY ALSO INTRODUCED SOMETHING THAT IS NOW ONE OF NETFLIX'S PROUDEST HALLMARKS, SMART SUGGESTION ALGORITHMS.
YOU1000000133_S0000020	ONCE A CUSTOMER HAD RENTED ENOUGH TITLES, NETFLIX COULD AUTOMATICALLY SUGGEST NEW MOVIES THAT WERE LIKELY TO INTEREST THEM. NOWADAYS, WHEN GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US, IT'S EASY TO TAKE SUCH ALGORITHMS FOR GRANTED, BUT IN 1997 THEY WERE PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF.
YOU1000000133_S0000021	NETFLIX STARTED STRONG, AND JUST 48 HOURS AFTER OPENING, THEY HAD TO UPGRADE THEIR WEBSITE'S BANDWIDTH DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE TRAFFIC THEY WERE RECEIVING.
YOU1000000133_S0000022	SOON, NETFLIX SIGNED PROMOTIONAL DEALS WITH TOSHIBA, HEWLETT PACKARD AND SONY, WHEREBY THEY OFFERED FREE RENTALS TO PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT NEW DVD PLAYERS.
YOU1000000133_S0000023	IN JULY 1999, NETFLIX SECURED A $30 MILLION CAPITAL INJECTION FROM GROUP R&O, WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO START A SUBSCRIPTION BASED SERVICE CALLED THE MARQUEE PROGRAM.
YOU1000000133_S0000024	FOR JUST UNDER $16 PER MONTH, CUSTOMERS COULD RENT OUT AS MANY DVDS AS THEY WANTED, AS LONG AS THEY HAD NO MORE THAN 4 DVDS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. NO LATE FEES, NO DUE DATES, IT WAS PERFECT.
YOU1000000133_S0000025	BY THAT POINT NETFLIX WAS ALREADY RECEIVING 10,000 DVD ORDERS EVERY DAY, BUT THEIR TOTAL REVENUE WAS SITTING AT BARELY 5 MILLION DOLLARS. COMPARE THIS TO BLOCKBUSTER'S FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE AND YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE WHY NETFLIX DECIDED TO TRY TO TEAM UP WITH THEM.
YOU1000000133_S0000026	BLOCKBUSTER WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST VIDEO RENTAL COMPANIES AND IT WAS BY FAR THE LARGEST, WITH 60,000 EMPLOYEES AND 8,000 STORES SPREAD ACROSS THE US.
YOU1000000133_S0000027	AS THE POPULARITY OF NETFLIX GREW, EVERYONE THOUGHT BLOCKBUSTER WOULD SOON ENTER THE MARKET, AND WITH THEIR VAST RESOURCES, THEY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY CRUSHED THEIR YOUNG COMPETITOR.
YOU1000000133_S0000028	THAT'S WHY NETFLIX DECIDED TO ACT FIRST, AND SO IN THE EARLY YEAR 2000 THEY INVITED BLOCKBUSTER TO BECOME A STRATEGIC PARTNER AND INVESTOR.
YOU1000000133_S0000029	NETFLIX WOULD BECOME THE INTERNET ARM OF THE BLOCKBUSTER BRAND, DROPPING THE NETFLIX NAME ALTOGETHER IN FAVOR OF BLOCKBUSTER.COM.
YOU1000000133_S0000030	BLOCKBUSTER LAUGHED THEM OUT OF THE BOARDROOM. THEY WERE CERTAIN NETFLIX WOULD CRUMBLE AS IT HAD YET TO TURN A PROFIT THREE YEARS AFTER ITS CREATION. INSTEAD, A FEW MONTHS LATER, BLOCKBUSTER PARTNERED UP WITH ENRON BROADBAND.
YOU1000000133_S0000031	A DIVISION OF THE ENERGY COMPANY YOU PROBABLY KNOW TODAY FOR ITS NOTORIOUSLY FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.
YOU1000000133_S0000033	OF COURSE, AT THE TIME NOBODY KNEW THAT, AND SO INVESTORS PRAISED BLOCKBUSTER'S DECISION. THE SITUATION FOR NETFLIX LOOKED GRIM. THEY WERE LOSING MONEY FAST, AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR THEY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $57 MILLION.
YOU1000000133_S0000034	DESPITE DOUBTS COMING FROM ALL SIDES, HASTINGS WAS CONVINCED THAT DVD TECHNOLOGY WOULD PREVAIL. THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED TO HIM WAS TO SIMPLY SURVIVE UNTIL THAT HAPPENED, AND 2001 WAS THE YEAR WHEN THINGS FINALLY STARTED GOING HIS WAY.
YOU1000000133_S0000035	THE PRICE OF DVD PLAYERS PLUMMETED, WITH SOME GOING AROUND FOR LESS THAN A HUNDRED BUCKS. 2001 ALSO SAW THE 9 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS. FEARFUL AMERICANS TOOK REFUGE IN THEIR HOMES, AND NETFLIX SUBSCRIPTIONS SKYROCKETED.
YOU1000000133_S0000036	DESPITE GROWING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE, NETFLIX STILL HADN'T TURNED A PROFIT, AND SO IN 2002 THEY WENT PUBLIC TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING. IN 2003 THEY CROSSED THE 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBER MARK AND FINALLY HAD THEIR FIRST PROFITABLE YEAR.
YOU1000000133_S0000037	JUST AS THEIR FORTUNES STARTED TO TURN, HOWEVER, IN 2004 BLOCKBUSTER FINALLY RELEASED THEIR OWN ONLINE DVD MAIL SERVICE. BEFORE LONG, WALMART ALSO JOINED THE FRAY, AND A THREE WAY BATTLE TO UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER ENSUED.
YOU1000000133_S0000038	BLOCKBUSTER AND WALMART, HOWEVER, WERE A BIT LATE TO THE PARTY. HASTINGS ADMITTED THAT IF THEY HAD STARTED TWO YEARS EARLIER, THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON. ON AN END OF YEAR CONFERENCE CALL, HASTINGS DECLARED,
YOU1000000133_S0000039	WHEN THE CEO OF BLOCKBUSTER HEARD THAT, HE PROMPTLY HAD A KITCHEN SINK DELIVERED TO THE NETFLIX OFFICE, A FAIRLY CREATIVE WAY OF DECLARING WAR.
YOU1000000133_S0000040	AS THE COMPETITORS UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER, NETFLIX SAW ITS BRIEF PROFITABILITY EVAPORATE AND ITS STOCK FELL BY 75%.
YOU1000000133_S0000041	DESPITE LOSING MONEY, THEY KEPT ON GROWING, AND BY 2005 NETFLIX WAS SHIPPING 1 MILLION DVDS EVERY DAY FROM THEIR ASSORTMENT OF OVER 35,000 TITLES. EVENTUALLY, THIS DRAWN OUT BATTLE OF ATTRITION TOOK ITS TOLL.
YOU1000000133_S0000042	AND IN 2005, WALMART DECIDED TO QUIT. BLOCKBUSTER FOLLOWED SUIT, AND AS THE ERA OF BRICK AND MORTAR VIDEO RENTAL CAME TO AN END, SO DID THEIR SUCCESS. IN 2008, THE SAME CEO THAT HAD REJECTED NETFLIX WAS FIRED.
YOU1000000133_S0000043	AND BY 2010 BLOCKBUSTER HAD FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY. NETFLIX HAD EMERGED VICTORIOUS, AND IN 2007 IT CELEBRATED THE DELIVERY OF ITS BILLIONTH DVD. THEN, IN A SINGLE ANNOUNCEMENT, HASTINGS BEGAN THE JOURNEY OF MAKING THE VERY BEDROCK OF HIS COMPANY OBSOLETE.
YOU1000000133_S0000044	THIS WAS HIS ENDGAME, THE REASON HE HAD BEEN WILLING TO SACRIFICE PROPHETS FOR SO LONG AND THE SAME REASON HE HAD PROPHETICALLY CITED BACK IN THE YEAR 2000. VIDEO ON DEMAND.
YOU1000000133_S0000046	NETFLIX FIRST STARTED OFFERING STREAMING OF ON DEMAND VIDEOS IN 2007, AND INITIALLY THE SERVICE WAS AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. AT FIRST, MOVIE RIGHTS WERE HARD TO COME BY, AND THE VIDEOS AVAILABLE TO STREAM ON NETFLIX WERE, WELL, PRETTY AWFUL.
YOU1000000133_S0000047	BUT IN OCTOBER 2008, THEY SIGNED A DEAL WITH PREMIUM CABLE OUTLET STARUS, WHICH BROUGHT IN SOME HUGE DISNEY AND SONY LIBRARY RELEASES. THE DEAL COST NETFLIX ONLY $20 MILLION, A PRICE THEY SOON DISCOVERED WAS AN ABSOLUTE BARGAIN.
YOU1000000133_S0000048	THE REASON NETFLIX GOT SUCH A GREAT PRICE WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONLY BIG PLAYER IN TOWN, AND PRETTY SOON THEY SIGNED DEALS WITH PARAMOUNT, MGM, AND LIONSGATE.
YOU1000000133_S0000049	NETFLIX WERE ALSO PUSHING FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER BRANDS, AND BEFORE LONG THEY WERE FEATURED ON NEARLY EVERY MAJOR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ON THE PLANET. THEY BUDDIED UP WITH APPLE, PLAYSTATION, XBOX, NINTENDO WII, AND A BUNCH OF OTHER BRANDS.
YOU1000000133_S0000050	BY 2010, NEARLY 30% OF ALL NORTH AMERICAN BROADBAND TRAFFIC DURING PEAK HOURS CAME FROM NETFLIX. THEY EXPANDED INTO CANADA IN 2010, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN IN 2011, AND EUROPE IN 2012.
YOU1000000133_S0000051	2011 TURNED OUT TO BE A YEAR OF HUGE SURPRISES FOR NETFLIX. IN RESPONSE TO THE EVER INCREASING COST OF CONTENT STREAMING LICENSES, NETFLIX ANNOUNCED THE PRODUCTION OF THEIR FIRST PIECE OF ORIGINAL CONTENT. IT WOULD BE A POLITICAL DRAMA CALLED HOUSE OF CARDS.
YOU1000000133_S0000052	FEATURING KEVIN SPACEY AND DIRECTED BY DAVID FINCHER. NETFLIX MANAGED TO OUTBID HBO BY ORDERING THE FIRST TWO SEASONS UP FRONT FOR $100 MILLION. IN OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR, HOWEVER, NETFLIX MADE A MUCH LESS SUCCESSFUL MOVE.
YOU1000000133_S0000053	THEY INTRODUCED A NEW SERVICE CALLED QUICKSTER, WHICH, YES, IS SPELLED WITH A W. IN REALITY, THERE WAS NOTHING NEW ABOUT QUICKSTER AT ALL, IT WAS BASICALLY THE SPIN OFF OF NETFLIX'S OLD DVD RENTAL SERVICE.
YOU1000000133_S0000054	THE BRANDING WAS SLOPPY, UNIMAGINATIVE, AND JUST NOT THOUGHT OUT, BUT THE PUBLIC'S RESPONSE TO QUICKSTER WAS EVEN WORSE. NETFLIX LOST 800,000 SUBSCRIBERS IN A SINGLE MONTH, AND THREE MONTHS LATER THEIR SHARES HAD LOST TWO THIRDS OF THEIR VALUE.
YOU1000000133_S0000055	UNSURPRISINGLY, THEY SHUT QUICKSTER DOWN THE VERY NEXT MONTH, BRINGING THE TWO ARMS OF THE BUSINESS BACK TOGETHER. THE FIRST PIECE OF NETFLIX ORIGINAL CONTENT WAS LILYHAMMER, WHICH AIRED ON FEBRUARY 6TH, 2012.
YOU1000000133_S0000056	IT WAS A RELATIVE SUCCESS, AND IT PAVED THE WAY FOR THE BIGGER SHOWS THAT WERE TO FOLLOW IN 2013. FIRST AND FOREMOST WAS HOUSE OF CARDS, WHICH FIRST AIRED ON FEBRUARY 1ST AND BECAME ONE OF NETFLIX'S MOST ACCLAIMED TITLES.
YOU1000000133_S0000057	AIRING THE ENTIRE FIRST SEASON ALL AT ONCE WAS A BOLD MOVE BY NETFLIX AND IT REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY PEOPLE WATCH TV SHOWS. FOLLOWING THE SAME FORMAT CAME ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT IN MAY AND ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK IN JULY.
YOU1000000133_S0000058	NETFLIX CONTINUED TO USE SUGGESTION ALGORITHMS TO KEEP PEOPLE GLUED TO THEIR COMPUTERS, WATCHING SERIES AFTER SERIES, EACH AVAILABLE WHEN IT'S ENTIRELY ON DEMAND.
YOU1000000133_S0000060	THESE ALGORITHMS HAVE BECOME EXPONENTIALLY SMARTER IN RECENT YEARS, AND THEY CAN NOW SPOT GAPS IN THE MARKET, GIVING NETFLIX A MEDGE IN DEVELOPING NEW SHOWS.
YOU1000000133_S0000061	AT THIS POINT NETFLIX CAN CREATE ORIGINAL CONTENT BASED SOLELY ON WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WANT BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW THEY WANT IT.
YOU1000000133_S0000062	THAT STRATEGY HAS WORKED OUT MARVELOUSLY FOR THEM SO FAR, AND IN 2013 NETFLIX RECEIVED 14 EMMY NOMINATIONS, 9 OF WHICH WERE FOR HOUSE OF CARDS.
YOU1000000133_S0000063	THEY CONTINUE TO CREATE ORIGINAL CONTENT, FROM TV SERIES TO DOCUMENTARIES TO MOVIES, THOUGH PERHAPS THEIR FAITH IN ADAM SANDLER, WITH WHOM THEY ARE RELEASING FOUR NEW MOVIES, IS SOMEWHAT MISPLACED.
YOU1000000133_S0000064	BY THE END OF 2016, NETFLIX WILL HAVE RELEASED 600 HOURS OF NEW ORIGINAL CONTENT FOR THE YEAR AND THEY WILL HAVE SPENT A WHOPPING $6 BILLION ON CONTENT ACQUISITION. THIS AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION IS THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE.
YOU1000000133_S0000065	WITH AMAZON AND HULU KNOCKING ON THE DOOR WITH THEIR OWN ON DEMAND SERVICES AND ORIGINAL CONTENT. RECENTLY, NETFLIX INTEGRATED ITS SERVICE WITH COMCAST'S X1 PLATFORM, A DEAL THAT COULD BRING THEM UPWARDS OF 4 MILLION NEW SUBSCRIBERS.
YOU1000000133_S0000066	IN SUCH A COMPETITIVE MARKET, HOWEVER, A SINGLE MISTAKE CAN BE DEADLY, AND THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH COMPANIES OUT THERE EAGERLY AWAITING NETFLIX'S NEXT STUMBLE. IT'S STILL ON TOP AT THE MOMENT, BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN IT STAY THERE?

YOU1000000134_S0000000	LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN WERE THE KIND OF GUYS WHO KEPT BILL GATES UP AT NIGHT. JOURNALIST KEN OLETTA
YOU1000000134_S0000001	I SAID, MR. GATES, WHAT IS YOUR NIGHTMARE? AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD SAY APPLE OR NETSCAPE OR ORACLE. AND HE SAID, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WORRY ABOUT.
YOU1000000134_S0000002	I WORRY ABOUT SOME GUY IN A GARAGE INVENTING A NEW TECHNOLOGY MICROSOFT HAS NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT.
YOU1000000134_S0000004	WELL, IN 98, TWO GUYS WERE IN A GARAGE AND A HAND LETTED SIGN AND IT SAID GOOGLE WORLDWIDE HEADQUARTERS.
YOU1000000134_S0000006	IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE INNOVATION IS JUST PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION, LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN HAVE BECOME VIRTUAL MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE OF INFORMATION GATHERING.
YOU1000000134_S0000007	WHAT WE DON'T KNOW, WE GOOGLE.
YOU1000000134_S0000008	629,000 RESULTS! WOW! AND ALL THIS TIME I THOUGHT GOOGLING YOURSELF MEANT THE OTHER THING.
YOU1000000134_S0000009	NOT ANYMORE.
YOU1000000134_S0000010	SILICON VALLEY IS LITTERED WITH STARTUPS THAT HAVE STALLED OUT.
YOU1000000134_S0000011	WHY THESE TWO COMPUTER SCIENCE GEEKS SUCCEEDED MAY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE NEARLY PARALLEL LIVES THEY LED BEFORE CREATING TOGETHER ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST AND MOST POWERFUL COMPANIES.
YOU1000000134_S0000012	BRIN AND PAIGE RESPECTFULLY DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM.
YOU1000000134_S0000014	SERGEI BRIN WAS BORN IN THE SOVIET UNION IN 1973. HIS PARENTS WERE MATHEMATICIANS AND JEWISH, WHICH LIMITED THEIR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES.
YOU1000000134_S0000016	MARK MALSEED IS THE CO AUTHOR OF THE GOOGLE STORY.
YOU1000000134_S0000017	SO, SERGEI'S FATHER WENT TO A CONFERENCE IN WARSAW, MET A WHOLE BUNCH OF COLLEAGUES FROM THE WEST, SAW WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE OUTSIDE THE SOVIET UNION, CAME BACK, SAT THE FAMILY DOWN AND SAID, WE HAVE TO LEAVE.
YOU1000000134_S0000019	HIS PARENTS BROUGHT WITH THEM A SENSE OF PURPOSE THEY INSTILLED IN THEIR SON. IT BOILED DOWN TO A SIMPLE MESSAGE.
YOU1000000134_S0000020	DON'T COME BACK WITH A B. DON'T COME BACK WITH A SECOND PLACE AWARD. MAKE IT FIRST.
YOU1000000134_S0000021	AND SERGEY INTERNALIZED THIS, AND IT DID FORM A CORE PART OF HIS PERSONALITY.
YOU1000000134_S0000022	LIKE BRYN, LARRY PAGE WAS BORN IN 1973.
YOU1000000134_S0000024	HIS FAMILY LIVED IN MICHIGAN AND HIS FATHER WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN HIS FAMILY TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE.
YOU1000000134_S0000025	BOTH OF HIS PARENTS WERE IN SIMILAR FIELDS AS BRINS.
YOU1000000134_S0000027	THEY WERE A SECOND GENERATION COMPUTER SCIENCE, WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS VERY UNUSUAL BECAUSE COMPUTER SCIENCE WAS REALLY ONLY DEVELOPING AS A FIELD.
YOU1000000134_S0000028	IN THE 60S AND HERE BOTH OF THEIR PARENTS WERE ADVANCED DEGREES.
YOU1000000134_S0000029	THEY SEE THEMSELVES AS ON A MISSION AND THAT MISSION IT REALLY DOES SPRING FROM
YOU1000000134_S0000031	IN 2009, PAGE SHARED THAT MISSION WITH THE GRADUATING CLASS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
YOU1000000134_S0000032	YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH A VIVID DREAM? AND YOU KNOW HOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PENCIL AND PAD BY THE BED?
YOU1000000134_S0000033	IT WILL BE COMPLETELY GONE BY THE NEXT MORNING. I HAD ONE OF THOSE DREAMS WHEN I WAS 23.
YOU1000000134_S0000034	WHEN I SUDDENLY WOKE UP, I WAS THINKING, WHAT IF WE COULD DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE WEB AND JUST KEEP THE LINKS? AND I GRABBED A PEN AND STARTED WRITING.
YOU1000000134_S0000035	SOON AFTER, I TOLD MY ADVISOR, TERRY WINOGRAD,
YOU1000000134_S0000036	IT WOULD TAKE A COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR ME TO DOWNLOAD THE WEB. HE NODDED KNOWINGLY, FULLY AWARE IT WOULD TAKE MUCH LONGER, BUT WISE ENOUGH NOT TO TELL ME.
YOU1000000134_S0000038	STANFORD PROFESSOR AND ENGINEERING CONSULTANT TO GOOGLE, TERRY WINOGRAD.
YOU1000000134_S0000039	LARRY JUST THINKS OF WAYS OF DOING THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT. SERGEY WAS A LOT LIKE LARRY. HE ALSO WAS SOMEONE WHO REALLY WANTED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX, TO SAY, IF THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, LET'S TRY IT.
YOU1000000134_S0000040	IT WAS 1995 AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY WHEN THE HEADSTRONG OVERACHIEVERS FIRST MET.
YOU1000000134_S0000042	ONE OF THEIR STANFORD PROFESSORS USED TO SAY, WELL, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM WAS THAT SERGEY WOULD JUST BURST INTO MY OFFICE WITHOUT ASKING. LARRY WOULD KNOCK AND THEN BURST IN.
YOU1000000134_S0000044	IN THE 90S, SEARCHING THE INTERNET WAS RUDIMENTARY, HIT OR MISS, OFTEN RETURNING RESULTS THAT WERE USELESS. AND THE PROCESS WAS VERY SLOW.
YOU1000000134_S0000045	SO YOU TYPE IN YOUR QUERY. YOU DID SOMETHING ELSE WHILE YOU WAITED FOR IT TO GET THE RESULTS. THEN YOU WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT THE RESULTS AND MOST OF THEM WERE COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT.
YOU1000000134_S0000046	PAIGE AND BRYNN PUSHED FOR SOMETHING BETTER.
YOU1000000134_S0000048	SERGEI'S BIG INTEREST WAS IN TAKING ALL THE PAGES ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB AND TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT, TRYING TO FIND PATTERNS.
YOU1000000134_S0000049	THEY STARTED TO DO A RECORD OF BACKLINKS, THEY CALLED THEM.
YOU1000000134_S0000051	PAGE NOTICED THAT BEHIND EVERY WEB PAGE THERE WERE HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF OTHER PAGES THAT LINKED TO IT.
YOU1000000134_S0000053	IT WAS A EUREKA MOMENT THAT WOULD CHANGE THE SO CALLED INFORMATION AGE.
YOU1000000134_S0000055	THEN THEY REALIZED THAT THAT LIST OF BACKLINKS COULD BE USED FOR RANKING.
YOU1000000134_S0000057	SO YOU WERE BETTER PAID.
YOU1000000134_S0000059	IF A LOT OF OTHER WEBSITES LINKED TO A WEB PAGE, THAT PROBABLY MEANT USERS THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.
YOU1000000134_S0000061	SO THE GENIUS WAS IN RECOGNIZING THAT THIS KIND OF ALGORITHM COULD GIVE YOU THE KIND OF RESULTS THAT MATTERED THE MOST TO SEARCHERS.
YOU1000000134_S0000062	PAGE AND BRIN HAD THEIR SECRET FORMULA.
YOU1000000134_S0000064	NOW IT NEEDED A NAME.
YOU1000000134_S0000065	THE GUYS WERE LOOKING FOR A GREAT NAME THAT WAS GOING TO CAPTURE THE GRANDIOSE VISION THAT THEY HAD AND HIT UPON THIS GIANT NUMBER.
YOU1000000134_S0000067	ONE WITH 100 ZEROS AFTER IT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS GOOGLE. G O O G O L.
YOU1000000134_S0000068	THEY DISCOVERED IT WAS OWNED. THEY SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S PUT A FRIENDLIER SPELLING ON IT.
YOU1000000134_S0000070	ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1997, THEY REGISTERED GOOGLE AS A WEBSITE.
YOU1000000134_S0000071	AND PAGE AND BRIN DROPPED OUT OF THEIR PHD PROGRAMS TO FOCUS ON ATTRACTING FUNDING FOR THEIR YOUNG COMPANY.
YOU1000000134_S0000072	IT WOULDN'T BE EASY. INVESTORS LIKE RAM SHARAM WERE SKEPTICAL.
YOU1000000134_S0000073	THERE WERE FIVE SEARCH ENGINES AT THE TIME AND SO I SAID MAYBE ANY ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNOLOGY. THE WORLD DIDN'T NEED A SIXTH SEARCH ENGINE.
YOU1000000134_S0000075	GOOGLE JUST DIDN'T FIT INTO THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OF WHAT A WEBSITE SHOULD DO, WHICH WAS TO KEEP USERS FROM MIGRATING TO ANOTHER PAGE.
YOU1000000134_S0000076	GOOGLE DID THE UNTHINKABLE. IT HELPED USERS EXPLORE THE WIDER WEB.
YOU1000000134_S0000077	LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN HAD A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. THEY SAID, WE DON'T WANT A PORTAL.
YOU1000000134_S0000078	WE WANT TO GET THE SEARCH RESULTS TO THEM IN A SPLIT SECOND.
YOU1000000134_S0000080	SO ONE SUNNY MORNING, LARRY AND SERGEY WERE SITTING ON THE PORCH OF A STANFORD PROFESSOR, A FRIEND OF THEIRS.
YOU1000000134_S0000081	AND ANDY BECHTOLSHEIM, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF SUN MICROSYSTEMS, PULLS UP IN HIS SPORTS CAR, WALKS UP, GETS ABOUT A 10 MINUTE DEMO, SAYS, THIS IS FANTASTIC. THIS IS THE NEXT BIG, BIG THING.
YOU1000000134_S0000082	AND WRITES A CHECK ON THE SPOT FOR $100,000 MADE OUT TO GOOGLE, INC.
YOU1000000134_S0000083	STEPHEN LEVY IS SENIOR WRITER OF WIRED MAGAZINE.
YOU1000000134_S0000084	THIS IS THE WAY THINGS WORK IN SILICON VALLEY. IT SOUNDS ASTOUNDING THAT SOMEONE WOULD JUST WRITE A $100,000 CHECK AND GET YOU GOING.
YOU1000000134_S0000085	BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A HIDDEN PEDIGREE TO THIS.
YOU1000000134_S0000086	THEY WERE AT STANFORD. THEIR PROFESSORS HAD DONE THIS BEFORE. THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD BET. WE MIGHT LOSE $100,000, BUT WE COULD WIN BIG THERE.
YOU1000000134_S0000087	AND AT THE TIME WE HAD NO COMPANY AT ALL.
YOU1000000134_S0000088	AND IN FACT, WE COULDN'T CASH THE CHECK.
YOU1000000134_S0000090	THIS IS BY THE WAY WITH NO LEGAL DOCUMENTS, NONE OF THAT STUFF.
YOU1000000134_S0000092	AND EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD THE SEED MONEY, THEY STILL NEEDED MUCH MORE CASH. NO ONE WAS BUYING INTO GOOGLE.
YOU1000000134_S0000093	THEY WENT BACK TO RAMSHARAM.
YOU1000000134_S0000094	THEY FOUND THREE OTHER INVESTORS AND TOGETHER WE RAISED ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THEM OFF THE GROUND.
YOU1000000134_S0000096	ENOUGH MONEY WAS $1 MILLION, INCLUDING $250,000 FROM JEFF BEZOS OF AMAZON.COM.
YOU1000000134_S0000098	PAGE AND BRIN INCORPORATED GOOGLE ON SEPTEMBER 4TH, 1998, AND THEY MOVED INTO ONE OF THOSE STORIED GARAGES IN MENLO PARK.
YOU1000000134_S0000099	THEY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF TWO WELL KNOWN SILICON VALLEY VENTURE CAPITALISTS, MICHAEL MORITZ OF SEQUOIA CAPITAL AND JOHN DOERR OF KLEINER PERKINS.
YOU1000000134_S0000100	BOTH WANTED AN EXCLUSIVE DEAL. BRENNAN PAGE SAID NO DEAL.
YOU1000000134_S0000101	THEY HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND AT THEIR TENDER AGE, THEY WERE IN THEIR MID TWENTIES THEN, TO SAY, WE WON'T TAKE MONEY FROM ONLY ONE VENTURE CAPITALIST.
YOU1000000134_S0000102	WE WANT TO ASSURE THAT NEITHER ONE OF THEM HAS CONTROLS WHO WANT TO SPLIT IT.
YOU1000000134_S0000103	IN JUNE OF 1999, GOOGLE ISSUED ITS FIRST PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE INVESTMENT, $25 MILLION.
YOU1000000134_S0000105	BRIN AND PAGE NOW NEEDED TO HIRE FIRST RATE ENGINEERS, PEOPLE WHO WOULD MEET THEIR EXACTING STANDARDS.
YOU1000000134_S0000106	CHRIS SAKA IS A FORMER GOOGLER.
YOU1000000134_S0000107	IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE HIRING PROCESSES OF ANY COMPANY IN THE WORLD. I HAD SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 12 AND 15 INTERVIEWS OVER JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS.
YOU1000000134_S0000108	THEY CREATED A HEADQUARTERS THEY CALLED THE GOOGLEPLEX, OFFERING EMPLOYEE SERVICES LIKE FREE FOOD AND CHILD CARE, AND DEVELOPED THE INFORMAL COMPANY MOTTO OF DON'T BE EVIL.
YOU1000000134_S0000110	BUT GOOGLE STILL WASN'T MAKING MONEY.
YOU1000000134_S0000111	LARRY WOULD COME IN AND I WOULD SAY, WELL, HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE MONEY FROM THIS? HE WOULD SORT OF GIVE US A LITTLE SMILE AND SAY, WELL, WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT.
YOU1000000134_S0000113	GOOGLE CO FOUNDERS LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN HAD CREATED A NEW SEARCH ENGINE, BUT HAD YET TO FIND A WAY TO TURN IT INTO PROFIT.
YOU1000000134_S0000114	THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF USING ADVERTISING TO CASH IN.
YOU1000000134_S0000115	AT FIRST THEY THOUGHT ADVERTISING WAS GRUBBY, COMMERCIAL, KIND OF UNSEEMLY.
YOU1000000134_S0000116	THEIR FAMOUSLY SPARSE HOMEPAGE WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED BY SERGEY BRIN.
YOU1000000134_S0000117	UNLIKE RIVALS YAHOO AND AOL, PAGE AND BRIN REFUSED TO CLUTTER THEIR HOMEPAGE WITH ADS.
YOU1000000134_S0000118	WE WON'T TAKE ANY ADS ON THE HOMEPAGE BECAUSE WE THINK TO BUILD USER TRUST WE WANT TO NOT FEEL LIKE WE'RE BOGGING THEM DOWN WITH ADVERTISEMENTS.
YOU1000000134_S0000119	YET NO ADS AT ALL MEANT NO REVENUE.
YOU1000000134_S0000120	PAGE AND BRIN HAD TO ACCEPT ADVERTISING AS THEIR ONLY OPTION.
YOU1000000134_S0000121	THERE WERE SEARCH ENGINES IN THE EARLY DAYS WHICH WHEN YOU WENT TO A PAGE, THE FIRST FEW THINGS WHICH LOOKED JUST LIKE REGULAR SEARCH RESULTS HAPPENED TO BE THINGS THAT THE SPONSORS OF THOSE HAD PAID THE SEARCH ENGINE TO PUT THERE.
YOU1000000134_S0000122	AND THEY SAID, THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR USERS. I DON'T WANT THE THINGS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS ME TO SEE. I WANT THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO SEE.
YOU1000000134_S0000124	THEN THEY FOUND A COMPROMISE THEY COULD LIVE WITH.
YOU1000000134_S0000125	THEY INVENTED A NEW WAY OF TARGETING TEXT ADS TRIGGERED BY SEARCH REQUESTS.
YOU1000000134_S0000126	INSTEAD OF DISTRACTING POP UPS OR FLASHING ADS, THESE SMALL ADS WERE PLACED ABOVE AND NEXT TO SEARCH RESULTS.
YOU1000000134_S0000127	IT'S FAMILIAR NOW, BUT REVOLUTIONARY BACK THEN.
YOU1000000134_S0000129	THEY CALLED IT GOOGLE ADWORDS.
YOU1000000134_S0000130	BUSINESSES, BIG AND SMALL, COULD TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR ADVERTISING DOLLARS BY PURCHASING ADS KEY TO CERTAIN WORDS.
YOU1000000134_S0000132	DAVID THACKER WAS A PROJECT MANAGER ON ADWORDS.
YOU1000000134_S0000133	ADVERTISERS LOVE THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY ONLY PAY WHEN SOMEONE ACTUALLY CLICKS ON THEIR AD.
YOU1000000134_S0000134	FOR MANY ADVERTISERS, IT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT FORM OF MARKETING THEY EVER HAVE.
YOU1000000134_S0000135	FOR BUSINESSES, IT WAS THE HOLY GRAIL, A DIRECT CONNECTION TO THEIR BEST CUSTOMERS. WITH A MASSIVE NEW REVENUE SOURCE, GOOGLE EXPLODED.
YOU1000000134_S0000136	BY SEPTEMBER OF 2000, IT HAD INDEXED A BILLION URLS AND WAS AVAILABLE IN 15 LANGUAGES.
YOU1000000134_S0000138	STILL, WITH ALL OF GOOGLE'S SUCCESS, FEW PEOPLE OUTSIDE SILICON VALLEY KNEW WHO HAD CREATED IT.
YOU1000000134_S0000140	SERGEI BRIN WENT ON TO TELL THE TRUTH
YOU1000000134_S0000142	AND FOOLED THE JUDGES.
YOU1000000134_S0000143	WILL O'REIL, SERGEY BRIN, PLEASE STAND UP.
YOU1000000134_S0000145	BUT MEDIA MOGULS KNEW EXACTLY WHO THEY WERE.
YOU1000000134_S0000146	BARRY DILLOW IS ONE OF THE FIRST TRADITIONAL MEDIA EXECUTIVES TO VISIT COOL GUYS.
YOU1000000134_S0000147	LARRY IS SITTING THERE WITH HIS PDA, HIS LITTLE HANDHELD DEVICE, AND HE'S LOOKING DOWN AND DOING HIS EMAIL.
YOU1000000134_S0000148	AND HE SAYS, LARRY, PLEASE, I'M TALKING TO YOU. CAN WE JUST CONVERSE?
YOU1000000134_S0000149	AND HE SAYS, I CAN DO BOTH. MARY DELLA SAYS, NO, YOU CAN'T DO BOTH. CHOOSE. HE SAYS, I CHOOSE THIS.
YOU1000000134_S0000151	WITH TREMENDOUS GROWTH CAME OTHER CHALLENGING ISSUES FOR THE SEARCH GIANT GOOGLE.
YOU1000000134_S0000152	THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS BEHIND THE COMPANY, MICHAEL MORITZ AND JOHN DOERR, WERE PRESSURING ITS CO FOUNDERS TO HIRE A CEO.
YOU1000000134_S0000153	THEY WERE RESISTANT, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, WE CAN DO IT. BUT THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DO IT.
YOU1000000134_S0000154	THEY WENT THROUGH 12, 13, 14 INTERVIEWS.
YOU1000000134_S0000155	THEY DIDN'T LIKE ANY OF THE PEOPLE THEY SAW.
YOU1000000134_S0000156	THEY VISITED STEVE JOBS JUST TO MEET HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A HERO OF THEIRS. AND THEY SAID TO JOHN DOERR AFTER THE MEETING, WHY CAN'T HE BE OUR CEO?
YOU1000000134_S0000157	JOHN DOAR INTRODUCED PAGE AND BRIN TO ERIC SCHMIDT, A BUSINESSMAN WITH AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND.
YOU1000000134_S0000159	HE'S COME OVER TO RUN GOOGLE.
YOU1000000134_S0000160	YES.
YOU1000000134_S0000161	SO WHAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND THAT? YOU GUYS COULDN'T RUN IT YOURSELF?
YOU1000000134_S0000162	PARENTAL SUPERVISION.
YOU1000000134_S0000163	TO BE HONEST.
YOU1000000134_S0000164	ERIC IS A GROWN UP IN THE ROOM. I MEAN, HE'S IN HIS MID 50S, NOT MID 30S. HE'S GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.
YOU1000000134_S0000165	HE'S MORE OF A DIPLOMAT THAN THEY ARE AND THAT'S NEEDED IN DEALING WITH THE TRADITIONAL MEDIA WORLD WHICH THEY INCREASINGLY BUMPING UP AGAINST.
YOU1000000134_S0000167	BY THE END OF 2001, ERIC SCHMIDT WAS GOOGLE'S CEO. PAGE BECAME PRESIDENT OF PRODUCTS AND BRIN THE PRESIDENT OF TECHNOLOGY.
YOU1000000134_S0000168	THE TWO FOUNDERS STILL SHARED AN OFFICE.
YOU1000000134_S0000169	THEY HAVE A MIND MELD. THEY ANTICIPATE EACH OTHER'S WORDS. THEY BACK EACH OTHER UP. THERE'S NO SENSE OF TENSION BETWEEN THEM. THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT STRENGTHS OF THAT COMPANY.
YOU1000000134_S0000170	WITH ERIC SCHMIDT IN PLACE, GOOGLE KEPT UP ITS SPECTACULAR GROWTH, WHILE ITS RIVALS SLOWLY FADED AWAY.
YOU1000000134_S0000172	THE SEARCH ENGINE LINKED TO 3 BILLION WEB PAGES AND FORGED A PARTNERSHIP WITH AOL, WHICH BROUGHT THEM 34 MILLION NEW CUSTOMERS.
YOU1000000134_S0000174	YOU HAD THIS INCREDIBLY PROFITABLE COMPANY. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF CAPITAL GROWTH THAT THEY NEEDED?
YOU1000000134_S0000176	THE SOLUTION? IT WAS TIME FOR GOOGLE TO GO PUBLIC.
YOU1000000134_S0000177	BEING UNCONVENTIONAL THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HOLD AN IPO UNLIKE ANY THAT WALL STREET HAD EVER SEEN. THEY WERE GOING TO SET THE PRICE VIA AN AUCTION TO DETERMINE AND TRY TO EXTRACT THEIR GREATEST VALUE FROM THE STOCK.
YOU1000000134_S0000179	THE STOCK PRICE ON AUGUST 19, 2004 CLOSED AT JUST OVER $100 A SHARE, MAKING THE COMPANY WORTH MORE THAN $23 BILLION.
YOU1000000134_S0000180	THE TWO FOUNDERS BECAME BILLIONAIRES.
YOU1000000134_S0000182	SOON, THE COMPANY EXPANDED WITH GOOGLE MAPS, GOOGLE NEWS, AND GOOGLE EARTH.
YOU1000000134_S0000184	THEIR IDEALISM AND BOLD IDEAS HAD BUILT THEIR REPUTATION. BUT THE COMPANY WAS STUMBLING WITH THEIR FREE EMAIL SERVICE.
YOU1000000134_S0000186	GMAIL WAS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT WAS REALLY POORLY LAUNCHED.
YOU1000000134_S0000187	WHEN USERS SAW ADS POP UP THAT WERE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THEIR PERSONAL EMAILS, ALARMS WENT OFF.
YOU1000000134_S0000188	WHEN PEOPLE FIRST SAW THESE ADS, THEY WERE SHOCKED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT, HOW COULD THESE ADS BE SO TARGETED? I'M READING THIS EMAIL ABOUT MY FRIEND'S VACATION TO HAWAII. I'M GETTING ADS ABOUT HAWAII. IS SOMEBODY SNOOPING INTO MY EMAIL?
YOU1000000134_S0000189	THE CONCERN AROUND GMAIL LAUNCHED A MUCH DEEPER FUNDAMENTAL ARGUMENT ABOUT PRIVACY AND TRUST.
YOU1000000134_S0000190	DO YOU KNOW HOW GOOGLE'S USING ALL THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS ON YOU?
YOU1000000134_S0000191	ALL OF THE WEB SEARCHES THAT I'VE DONE FOR YEARS AND YEARS, ALL OF THE EMAILS THAT I'VE DONE, POTENTIALLY INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH RECORDS, INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOOKS THAT I'M LOOKING AT, INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE I'M GOING BECAUSE I'M TYPING IT INTO GOOGLE MAPS.
YOU1000000134_S0000193	IN A SENSE, THEY'RE THE BIG BROTHER THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE YEARS.
YOU1000000134_S0000195	THE ULTIMATE BIG BROTHER WAS ABOUT TO PUT THEIR DON'T BE EVIL PHILOSOPHY TO THE TEST.
YOU1000000134_S0000197	IN 2006, GOOGLE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH CHINA FOR ACCESS TO THEIR 400 MILLION WEB USERS.
YOU1000000134_S0000199	WITH ONE CONDITION. THEY CENSOR SEARCH RESULTS OF BANNED TOPICS.
YOU1000000134_S0000201	FOR BRYN, SON OF RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS, IT WAS A TROUBLING DECISION.
YOU1000000134_S0000202	AT GOOGLE'S FRIDAY MEETING, SERGEI SPOKE WITH PASSION ABOUT GROWING UP IN THE SOVIET UNION AND HOW HIS PARENTS LITERALLY ESCAPED THE SOVIET UNION AND COME TO AMERICA AND WHAT THAT MEANT TO HIM.
YOU1000000134_S0000203	AND THAT DIALOGUE HAPPENED, INCLUDING EVERYBODY. THEY WANTED TO HEAR FROM ALL THE EMPLOYEES THERE.
YOU1000000134_S0000204	SERGEY SWALLOWED HARD, BUT THEY ALL SAID AT GOOGLE, THIS IS THE BIGGEST CONSUMER MARKET AND WE HAVE TO BE HERE.
YOU1000000134_S0000206	GOOGLE AGREED TO CHINESE DEMANDS.
YOU1000000134_S0000207	I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THAT AND WE HAD TO SELF CENSOR A FAIR AMOUNT, BUT WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO CENSOR LESS AND LESS.
YOU1000000134_S0000208	AND OUR LOCAL COMPETITORS THERE ARE ALSO SENSORLESS.
YOU1000000134_S0000209	SO I FEEL LIKE OUR ENTRY
YOU1000000134_S0000211	MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE.
YOU1000000134_S0000212	BUT THINGS STARTED GOING DOWNHILL.
YOU1000000134_S0000214	GOOGLE DISCOVERED A CYBER ATTACK ON THEIR SYSTEMS.
YOU1000000134_S0000216	THE MORE TROUBLING THING TO ME IS THAT WE DISCOVERED THE MOTIVATION WHICH WE BELIEVED TO BE TO GAIN ACCESS TO GMAIL ACCOUNTS IN PARTICULAR FOR CHINESE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS.
YOU1000000134_S0000217	GOOGLE PULLED THE PLUG AND REDIRECTED USERS TO AN UNFILTERED SITE IN HONG KONG THAT ISN'T SUBJECT TO CENSORSHIP.
YOU1000000134_S0000218	IT'S REAL LIFE.
YOU1000000134_S0000219	YEAH, THIS IS REAL LIFE.
YOU1000000134_S0000221	YOUTUBE BEGAN AS A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE HOME VIDEOS. IT SOON GREW INTO ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOP SEARCH ENGINES.
YOU1000000134_S0000222	BY JULY 2006, USERS WERE UPLOADING 65,000 VIDEOS A DAY AND GOOGLE WANTED IN.
YOU1000000134_S0000224	THEY WENT OUT AND ACQUIRED YOUTUBE FOR 1.65 BILLION DOLLARS IN GOOGLE STOCK.
YOU1000000134_S0000225	YOUTUBE FOUNDERS CHAD HURLEY AND STEVE CHEN WERE THRILLED.
YOU1000000134_S0000226	TODAY WE HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS FOR YOU. WE'VE BEEN ACQUIRED BY GOOGLE. YEAH, THANKS.
YOU1000000134_S0000228	IN 2006, GOOGLE CEO ERIC SCHMIDT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TO STAY COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY ALSO HAD TO ENTER THE WORLD OF MOBILE PHONES.
YOU1000000134_S0000229	IN FACT, A YEAR EARLIER THEY HAD QUIETLY BOUGHT ANOTHER STARTUP, ANDROID, A SMALL COMPANY WITH SOFTWARE FOR CELL PHONES.
YOU1000000134_S0000230	THERE'S SO MANY MORE MOBILE PHONES THAN PERSONAL COMPUTERS. AS PEOPLE DO MORE AND MORE SEARCHES ON MOBILE PHONES, IT SHOULD EVENTUALLY BALANCE OUT. AGAIN, THIS WOULD BE MANY YEARS.
YOU1000000134_S0000231	IT DIDN'T TAKE YEARS.
YOU1000000134_S0000232	APPLE'S PHENOMENAL SUCCESS WITH THE IPHONE IN 2007 SET A COLLISION COURSE BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES.
YOU1000000134_S0000233	AND YEAH, IT'S VERY EXCITING TO BE HERE TODAY.
YOU1000000134_S0000234	MONTHS LATER, BRENNAN PAGE ANNOUNCED THEIR ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM WOULD RUN ON A VARIETY OF MOBILE PHONES.
YOU1000000134_S0000236	THEIR LONG TIME IDOL, STEVE JOBS, SLAMMED GOOGLE FOR ENTERING THE PHONE BUSINESS AND ACCUSED THEM OF TRYING TO KILL THE IPHONE.
YOU1000000134_S0000238	AT THE GOOGLE DEVELOPER CONFERENCE IN MAY OF 2010, GOOGLE'S VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING TORE INTO APPLE.
YOU1000000134_S0000239	IF GOOGLE DID NOT ACT WE FACED A DRACONIAN FUTURE
YOU1000000134_S0000240	A FUTURE WHERE ONE MAN, ONE COMPANY, ONE DEVICE, ONE CARRIER WOULD BE OUR ONLY CHOICE.
YOU1000000134_S0000241	THAT'S A FUTURE WE DON'T WANT.
YOU1000000134_S0000243	AND GOOGLE IS BATTLING WITH ANOTHER GIANT IN THE TECH WORLD.
YOU1000000134_S0000244	THEY PUMP UP AGAINST MICROSOFT IN SO MANY WAYS. THEY HAVE A BROWSER, CHROME. MICROSOFT HAS INTERNET EXPLORER.
YOU1000000134_S0000245	GOOGLE ALSO ACQUIRED COMPANIES THAT DEALT WITH ONLINE VERSIONS OF WORD PROCESSING SOFTWARE AND SPREADSHEETS.
YOU1000000134_S0000246	THINGS THAT DIRECTLY GO AFTER MICROSOFT'S JUGULAR WITH THEIR OFFICE PRODUCT.
YOU1000000134_S0000247	MICROSOFT FIRED BACK WITH ITS OWN SEARCH ENGINE, BING, WHICH DEBUTED IN SPRING OF 2009.
YOU1000000134_S0000248	CAN I ASK WHAT YOU MAKE OF BING? DO YOU LIKE IT?
YOU1000000134_S0000250	I THINK
YOU1000000134_S0000251	YOU A BING USER?
YOU1000000134_S0000252	OH YEAH, NO, NO, I USE ALL SEARCH ENGINES OUT THERE.
YOU1000000134_S0000253	I THINK THAT WHAT BING HAS REMINDED US IS THAT THE SEARCH IS A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET.
YOU1000000134_S0000254	BING IRONICALLY OFFERED GOOGLE PROTECTION BY LETTING THEM DODGE ACCUSATIONS OF BEING A MONOPOLY.
YOU1000000134_S0000256	BILL GATES SAID, THIS IS THE COMPANY THAT IS CLOSEST TO US AS A COMPETITOR.
YOU1000000134_S0000257	THEY ARE JUST AS HUNGRY AND AS RUTHLESS, YOU CAN USE THAT WORD, BUT I AM, AS WE ARE. THERE IS A DANGER, THEY MAKE A LOT OF ENEMIES.
YOU1000000134_S0000258	IT'S A BLIND SPOT BECAUSE THESE TWO FOUNDERS REALLY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS NOBLEMEN.
YOU1000000134_S0000259	THEY THINK THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS GOOD FOR THE WORLD. THEY'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED FEELING LIKE THE UNDERDOG, FEELING LIKE THE EVIL EMPIRE WAS MICROSOFT.
YOU1000000134_S0000260	AND NOW THEY'VE DISCOVERED THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE THE EVIL EMPIRE.
YOU1000000134_S0000261	THEIR OWN SLOGAN, DO NO EVIL, WAS SUDDENLY BEING USED AGAINST THEM.
YOU1000000134_S0000263	GOOGLE'S QUEST ON THE ROAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S INFORMATION TOOK A NEW TURN. CALL IT A DETOUR WITH AN AMBITIOUS FEATURE THEY CALLED STREET VIEW, AN ATTEMPT TO PHOTOGRAPH EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE PLANET.
YOU1000000134_S0000265	IT WOULD EVENTUALLY INCLUDE ORDINARY IMAGES FROM MAIN STREET.
YOU1000000134_S0000267	EXTRAORDINARY VIEWS OF ANTARCTICA.
YOU1000000134_S0000270	MANY PEOPLE FELT THEIR PRIVACY HAD BEEN COMPROMISED.
YOU1000000134_S0000271	GOOGLE ACKNOWLEDGED THE MISTAKE AND AGREED TO DESTROY DATA.
YOU1000000134_S0000273	THE COMPANY KNOWN FOR SEARCH WAS STRUGGLING TO DIVERSIFY AND WAS FACING AN AGGRESSIVE NEW CHALLENGER MARK ZUCKERBERG.
YOU1000000134_S0000275	FACEBOOK'S 1 BILLION USERS SPEND MORE TIME ON THE SOCIAL NETWORK, POSTING VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT IS INVISIBLE TO GOOGLE'S SEARCH ENGINE.
YOU1000000134_S0000276	INFORMATION THAT ALL ADVERTISERS CHASE.
YOU1000000134_S0000277	SO FAR, GOOGLE'S EFFORTS AT SOCIAL NETWORKING HAVE FAILED. BUT ITS FOUNDERS ARE KEENLY AWARE THAT ITS USERS' HABITS ON THE WEB CHANGE.
YOU1000000134_S0000278	GOOGLE WILL HAVE TO MAKE A LOT MORE FRIENDS.
YOU1000000134_S0000280	IN JANUARY 2011, IN A STARTLING SILICON VALLEY SHAKEUP, ERIC SCHMIDT ANNOUNCED THAT GOOGLE WAS SIMPLIFYING ITS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.
YOU1000000134_S0000281	AND THAT LARRY PAGE WAS READY TO LEAD AND WOULD TAKE OVER FROM HIM AS CEO.
YOU1000000134_S0000282	CO FOUNDER SERGEY BRIN WILL FOCUS ON NEW PRODUCTS.
YOU1000000134_S0000283	SCHMIDT TWEETED, DAY TO DAY ADULT SUPERVISION NO LONGER NEEDED.
YOU1000000134_S0000285	IN 14 YEARS, GOOGLE GREW FROM STARTUP TO TECHNOLOGY GIANT, HITTING $50 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2012.
YOU1000000134_S0000287	IN THE SPACE OF A YEAR, LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN BOTH GOT MARRIED.
YOU1000000134_S0000289	PAGE MARRIED STANFORD BIOINFORMATICS PHD LUCINDA SOUTHWORTH IN DECEMBER 2007 ON RICHARD BRANSON'S ISLAND. BRANSON WAS ALSO HIS BEST MAN.
YOU1000000134_S0000291	BRYN MARRIED BIOTECH SPECIALIST ANNE WOJCICKI IN THE BAHAMAS WITH HIS PARTNER LARRY PAGE STANDING UP FOR HIM. THEY BOTH HAVE TWO CHILDREN.
YOU1000000134_S0000293	GOOGLE.ORG, ITS PHILANTHROPIC ARM, HAS CONTRIBUTED OVER $100 MILLION TO VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, FROM CLEAN ENERGY TO GLOBAL HEALTH.
YOU1000000134_S0000295	LARRY PAGE AND SERGEY BRIN HAVE CHANGED THE WAY WE GET INFORMATION.
YOU1000000134_S0000296	IT'S BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO SEE THEM GROW OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS THAT I'VE KNOWN THEM. I FEEL EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED.
YOU1000000134_S0000297	LARRY AND SIRI ALWAYS HAD THIS KIND OF IRREVERENCE AS PART OF THEIR ATTITUDE, WHICH IS WHAT MADE THEM SO CREATIVE. IT'S GREAT.
YOU1000000134_S0000298	I THINK GOOGLE ATTRACTS PEOPLE WHO CARE. WHO CARE ABOUT USERS, WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR FELLOW HUMAN, WHO CARE ABOUT THE PLANET, AND JUST CAN'T SIT STILL. THEY BUILT A COMPANY THAT ABSOLUTELY CHANGED THE WORLD.
YOU1000000135_S0000000	SPACEX AND TESLA. YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND TWO COMPANIES THAT ARE MORE POPULAR TODAY.
YOU1000000135_S0000001	AND YET, IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT PAST, BOTH COMPANIES WERE BASICALLY UNKNOWN AND WERE IN FACT SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY.
YOU1000000135_S0000002	TODAY WE'LL LEARN HOW ELON MUSK DID WHAT NO OTHER AMERICAN CEO HAD EVER DONE BEFORE. HE CREATED AND THEN RESCUED TWO COMPANIES AT THE SAME TIME.
YOU1000000135_S0000003	AND BROUGHT THEM BOTH TO MULTI BILLION DOLLAR VALUATIONS.
YOU1000000135_S0000005	THIS VIDEO IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY AUDIBLE, AND THE STORY PRESENTED IN IT IS JUST ONE CHAPTER OF ELON MUSK'S AWESOME BIOGRAPHY.
YOU1000000135_S0000006	WHICH YOU CAN LISTEN TO FOR FREE AS PART OF YOUR 30 DAY FREE TRIAL IF YOU REGISTER WITH THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION.
YOU1000000135_S0000008	IN THE EARLY 2000S, ELON MUSK ACHIEVED WHAT ANY ENTREPRENEUR WOULD DREAM OF ACHIEVING. HE SUCCESSFULLY SOLD HIS COMPANY FOR OVER A BILLION DOLLARS.
YOU1000000135_S0000009	HE PERSONALLY RECEIVED 165 MILLION AND NOW THIS IS WHERE MOST PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT QUITS, BUT FOR ELON THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.
YOU1000000135_S0000010	HE WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER, AND ONE OF HIS IDEAS WAS TO SEND A GREENHOUSE TO MARS.
YOU1000000135_S0000011	IN ORDER TO BOOST PUBLIC INTEREST IN SPACE EXPLORATION AND HOPEFULLY INCREASE NASA'S BUDGET.
YOU1000000135_S0000012	THE IDEA WAS OUTLANDISHLY AMBITIOUS, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ELON WANTED TO SPEND NO MORE THAN $20 MILLION ON IT.
YOU1000000135_S0000013	NOW, AT THE TIME, SENDING JUST 500 POUNDS TO ORBIT COULD EASILY COST UPWARDS OF 30 MILLION. BUT ELON HAD A PLAN.
YOU1000000135_S0000014	HE TRAVELLED TO RUSSIA, WHERE HE TRIED TO BUY REFURBISHED INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES.
YOU1000000135_S0000015	BUT THE LOWEST PRICE THE RUSSIANS GAVE HIM WAS 8 MILLION DOLLARS A PIECE, ABOUT 50% ABOVE HIS BUDGET FOR THE ROCKET ITSELF.
YOU1000000135_S0000016	ON THE WAY BACK FROM MOSCOW, ELON DID SOME BACK OF THE NAPKIN CALCULATIONS.
YOU1000000135_S0000017	HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE MAKING OF A ROCKET WERE ONLY ABOUT 3% OF THE FINAL SALES PRICE.
YOU1000000135_S0000018	INSTANTLY, ELON KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO. IF HE WANTED TO SEND ANYTHING TO MARS, HE'D HAVE TO BUILD HIMSELF A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ROCKET COMPANY.
YOU1000000135_S0000019	TO THAT END, HE READ SEVERAL BOOKS ON ROCKETRY FROM THE COLD WAR, AND IN JUNE 2002 HE INCORPORATED SPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGIES, OR SPACEX FOR SHORT.
YOU1000000135_S0000020	HE THEN SET ABOUT RECRUITING THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE HIS VISION A REALITY.
YOU1000000135_S0000021	HIS IDEAL CANDIDATE WAS YOUNG, SINGLE, EDUCATED AND READY TO GIVE UP HIS SOCIAL LIFE FOR SPACEX.
YOU1000000135_S0000022	ELON'S RECRUITMENT STRATEGY WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
YOU1000000135_S0000023	HE'D BASICALLY CO OP ANYONE FITTING THAT PROFILE, FROM FRESH AEROSPACE GRADUATES TO THE RISING STARS IN BOEING AND LOCKHEED MARTIN.
YOU1000000135_S0000024	AT FIRST PEOPLE THOUGHT ELON WAS MAKING PRANKS, BUT WITHIN A YEAR HE HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST ENGINEERS IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000135_S0000025	TOGETHER, THEY WOULD DESIGN ALMOST EVERYTHING FOR SPACEX, FROM THE ENGINES AND ROCKET BODIES TO EVEN THE SMALLEST DETAILS, LIKE THE CIRCUITRY.
YOU1000000135_S0000026	IN MANY CASES, THE ENGINEERS COULD BUILD STRONGER AND MORE LIGHTWEIGHT COMPONENTS AT JUST A FRACTION OF THE REGULAR PRICE.
YOU1000000135_S0000027	THESE COMPONENTS WOULD BE USED TO BUILD THE MERLIN ENGINE, WHICH IN TURN WOULD POWER ELON'S FIRST ROCKET, THE FALCON 1.
YOU1000000135_S0000028	DEVELOPMENT WAS FAR FROM SMOOTH, OF COURSE, BUT NEVERTHELESS PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE. BUT THEN ELON DECIDED TO UP THE ANTE.
YOU1000000135_S0000029	IN EARLY 2004 HE PARTICIPATED IN THE FUNDING ROUND OF A NEW ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY CALLED TESLA.
YOU1000000135_S0000030	HE PERSONALLY INVESTED A LITTLE OVER 6 MILLION AND IN RETURN BECAME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD.
YOU1000000135_S0000031	RIGHT OFF THE BAT, ELON BEGAN APPLYING HIS EXPERIENCE FROM SPACEX AT TESLA.
YOU1000000135_S0000032	THE COMPANY'S LOGO, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS CREATED BY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT MADE THE LOGO FOR SPACEX.
YOU1000000135_S0000033	AND OF COURSE ELON WAS QUICK TO USE THE SAME AGGRESSIVE HIRING STRATEGY HE USED TO ASSEMBLE THE SPACEX TEAM.
YOU1000000135_S0000034	THIS TIME, HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF POACHING EMPLOYEES FROM BOEING, HE WAS HIRING FROM APPLE.
YOU1000000135_S0000035	BEFORE LONG, THE TESLA TEAM WAS WORKING ON THEIR FIRST ELECTRIC CAR, THE TESLA ROADSTER. BACK AT SPACEX, ENGINEERS WERE CLOCKING IN 60 HOUR WORK WEEKS
YOU1000000135_S0000036	WHILE ELON WAS PROMISING VERY AMBITIOUS TIMELINES.
YOU1000000135_S0000037	IN FACT, HIS ORIGINAL ESTIMATE WAS TO LAUNCH THE FALCON 1 IN NOVEMBER 2003, JUST 18 MONTHS AFTER THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED.
YOU1000000135_S0000038	OF COURSE, THAT ESTIMATE GOT PUSHED BACK, AND THE FALCON 1 WOULDN'T LIFT OFF UNTIL MARCH 2006.
YOU1000000135_S0000039	WHEN IT SPENT A TOTAL OF 41 SECONDS IN THE AIR BEFORE CRASHING DOWN VIOLENTLY. LIKE FOR SPACEX, 2006 WAS A BIG YEAR FOR TESLA.
YOU1000000135_S0000040	IN JULY, THE TESLA ROADSTER MADE ITS FIRST OFFICIAL APPEARANCE AND RECORDED 100 PRE ORDERS IN ITS FIRST DAY.
YOU1000000135_S0000041	BUT, LIKE WITH THE FALCON 1, THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION WASN'T GOING VERY WELL. TESLA'S CEO AT THE TIME WAS MARTIN EBERHARD.
YOU1000000135_S0000042	AND LIKE ELON, HE WAS PROMISING UNREALISTIC TIMEFRAMES. AT FIRST, THE IDEA WAS TO DELIVER THE ROADSTER IN EARLY 2007.
YOU1000000135_S0000043	BUT AN ESCALATING SERIES OF PRODUCTION ISSUES PUSHED THE RELEASE DATE FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY.
YOU1000000135_S0000044	IN THE END, MARTIN'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ROADSTER PROJECT GOT HIM OUSTED FROM THE VERY COMPANY HE HAD FOUNDED, LEAVING ELON IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.
YOU1000000135_S0000045	WITH FULL RESPONSIBILITY OVER BOTH COMPANIES, THE STRESS WAS STARTING TO PILE UP.
YOU1000000135_S0000046	ELON WITNESSED THE SECOND FAILURE OF THE FALCON 1 ROCKET, WHICH DIDN'T COMPLETE ITS ONLY 2007 FLIGHT.
YOU1000000135_S0000047	AT TESLA, ELON STRUGGLED FIXING THE MESS LEFT BEHIND BY EBERHARD, AND IN FACT, THE ROADSTER'S PRODUCTION WOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL MARCH 2008.
YOU1000000135_S0000048	BUT THEN THINGS GOT WORSE. IN AUGUST ELON LAUNCHED HIS THIRD FALCON 1
YOU1000000135_S0000050	WHICH NEVER MADE IT TO ORBIT, AND THEN JUST ONE MONTH LATER HIS WIFE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THEIR DIVORCE.
YOU1000000135_S0000051	BOTH OF ELON'S COMPANIES WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE A VIABLE PRODUCT AND WERE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY FAST.
YOU1000000135_S0000052	IN FACT, BY LATE OCTOBER, TESLA HAD ONLY $9 MILLION LEFT TO FUND THE ENTIRE COMPANY. SALARIES WERE BEING DELAYED AND ELON WAS FACED WITH A CHOICE.
YOU1000000135_S0000053	HE HAD ALREADY SPENT $70 MILLION ON TESLA AND $100 MILLION ON SPACEX.
YOU1000000135_S0000054	WITH WHAT LITTLE HE HAD LEFT, ELON HAD TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO FUND AND SECURE THE FUTURE OF ONE COMPANY, OR TO RISK EVERYTHING AND GAMBLE ON SAVING BOTH.
YOU1000000135_S0000055	FATE GAVE ELON LITTLE TIME TO THINK. THE FOURTH AND POTENTIALLY FINAL FLIGHT OF THE FALCON 1 WAS APPROACHING.
YOU1000000135_S0000056	ON SEPTEMBER 2008, ELON GOT READY FOR HIS LAST CHANCE TO SURVIVE. HE STOOD IN THE SPACEX CONTROL CENTER IN LA AND WAITED IN SILENCE.
YOU1000000135_S0000057	THEN, THE ROCKET TOOK OFF, AND THE CENTER BURST OUT AN ECSTATIC APPLAUSE. SPACEX HAD FINALLY DELIVERED A WORKING PRODUCT.
YOU1000000135_S0000058	THE FALCON 1 BECAME THE FIRST PRIVATELY DEVELOPED ROCKET TO GO INTO ORBIT AROUND EARTH. BUT ELON WASN'T IN THE CLEAR JUST YET.
YOU1000000135_S0000059	A WORKING PRODUCT WOULD MEAN NOTHING IF THE COMPANY BEHIND IT WENT BANKRUPT.
YOU1000000135_S0000060	IN A FRANTIC SCRAMBLE, ELON HAD TO FIGURE OUT FUNDING SOLUTIONS FOR BOTH HIS COMPANIES BEFORE THE END OF 2008. AND THE TIMING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE.
YOU1000000135_S0000061	ONE OF THE LARGEST AMERICAN BANKS, LEHMAN BROTHERS, HAD COLLAPSED, AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WAS HEADING TOWARDS DISASTER.
YOU1000000135_S0000062	IN THE MIDST OF THIS, ELON WAS RAISING ALL THE PERSONAL FUNDS HE COULD TO SAVE TESLA. HE LIQUIDATED HIS FEW REMAINING ASSETS AND EVEN GOT HIS COUSINS TO PITCH IN.
YOU1000000135_S0000063	BUT GETTING INVESTORS ON BOARD DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT, AND DECEMBER WAS CREEPING IN.
YOU1000000135_S0000064	ELON HAD MANAGED TO SCRAPE TOGETHER $20 MILLION HIMSELF, ANOTHER $20 MILLION FROM VARIOUS INVESTORS, AND $50 MILLION FROM THE GERMAN CAR COMPANY DAIMLER.
YOU1000000135_S0000065	DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY TESLA WAS GOING TO MAKE IT.
YOU1000000135_S0000066	BUT THEN, ON DECEMBER 23RD, ELON RECEIVED A VERY UNEXPECTED CALL.
YOU1000000135_S0000067	NASA HAD AWARDED SPACEX WITH A $1.6 BILLION CONTRACT TO RESUPPLY THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.
YOU1000000135_S0000068	THEN, ON CHRISTMAS EVE, THE TESLA DEAL WENT THROUGH. ELON HAD SUCCESSFULLY SAVED BOTH COMPANIES FROM BANKRUPTCY.
YOU1000000135_S0000069	IN LATER INTERVIEWS, HE'D RECALL THESE FINAL DAYS IN DECEMBER IN PAINFUL DETAIL.
YOU1000000135_S0000070	BUT I REMEMBER WAKING UP ON THE SUNDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN 2008 AND THINKING, LIKE, DAMN, THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER GOTTEN.
YOU1000000135_S0000071	AND IT WAS LOOKING PRETTY GRIM, BECAUSE AT THAT POINT, EVEN THOUGH THE FOURTH LAUNCH OF SPACEX HAD SUCCEEDED, WE WERE STILL RUNNING OUT OF MONEY.
YOU1000000135_S0000072	BECAUSE WE HAD THREE FAILURES AND ONLY ONE SUCCESS. STILL NOT ENOUGH.
YOU1000000135_S0000073	AND THEN THE FINANCING ROUND FOR TESLA HAD NOT CLOSED. AND WE HAD ONLY TWO DAYS, MAYBE TWO, I THINK. IT WAS LIKE TWO OR THREE DAYS MAYBE TO CLOSE IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
YOU1000000135_S0000074	SO I WAS LIKE, MAN, THIS COULD BE A REALLY BAD END OF THE YEAR. MAYBE BOTH COMPANIES WILL FAIL.
YOU1000000135_S0000075	SO REGARDLESS OF THE STRUGGLES ELON MIGHT BE FACING TODAY, IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT 10 YEARS AGO, HE OVERCAME THE IMPOSSIBLE.
YOU1000000135_S0000076	NOW, THIS STORY IS JUST A BRIEF CHAPTER IN THE JOURNEY OF ELON MUSK. IF YOU'D LIKE TO READ THE WHOLE THING, YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT ELON MUSK'S BIOGRAPHY.

YOU1000000135_S0000081	SEE YOU AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS, AND UNTIL THEN, STAY SMART.
YOU1000000136_S0000001	ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 12TH, 1944, 200 YOUNG AIRMEN SET OFF ON ONE OF THE MOST DARING RAIDS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000003	THERE'S THE TARGET. GO DO IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000005	AT THE TIME WE JUST GOT ON AND DID IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000007	THAT WAS OUR JOB.
YOU1000000136_S0000009	70 YEARS AGO, THEIR TARGET WAS LURKING IN A NORWEGIAN FJORD DEEP INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. THE ALLIES HAD ALREADY ATTACKED IT ON 33 SEPARATE OCCASIONS.
YOU1000000136_S0000011	WE WERE BEGINNING TO THINK THAT IT REALLY WAS UNSINKABLE.
YOU1000000136_S0000012	THEY TOLD US ON BOARD, THIS IS THE STRONGEST SHIP OF THE WORLD AND NEVER CAN SINK.
YOU1000000136_S0000013	THE TARGET WAS THE BATTLESHIP.
YOU1000000136_S0000015	HITLER CALLED IT THE PRIDE OF THE GERMAN NAVY. CHURCHILL NAMED IT THE BEAST. AND HE WAS WILLING TO RISK THE RAF'S FINEST UNITS, 9 SQUADRON AND THE DAMBUSTERS, TO SINK IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000017	IT NEVER OCCURRED TO US THAT WE WERE IN DANGER. THE CHAP EITHER SIDE OF US MAY HAVE BEEN, BUT WE WEREN'T.
YOU1000000136_S0000018	THAT DAY, THE DAM BUSTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT OUT OF THE SKY.
YOU1000000136_S0000020	WE UNCOVER NEW EVIDENCE TO HELP EXPLAIN ONE OF THE LUCKIEST ESCAPES OF THE WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000022	AND PERHAPS FOR THE FINAL TIME, KEY PARTICIPANTS IN ONE OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS RAIDS OF WORLD WAR II TELL THEIR STORY.
YOU1000000136_S0000024	WE SAID TO OURSELVES, WELL, WE'VE SUNK THE BEAST AT LAST.
YOU1000000136_S0000026	70 YEARS AFTER THE SINKING OF THE BATTLESHIP TIRPITZ, HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP IS EXPLORING THE NORWEGIAN FJORD THAT WAS ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE.
YOU1000000136_S0000028	IT LOOKS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE ONE OF THE SHIP'S PLATES. YOU CAN SEE SOME RIVETING HERE. SO THERE'S STILL LITTLE SCATTERED SORT OF MEMENTOS.
YOU1000000136_S0000030	OF TURPITS FLYING AROUND HERE TODAY, NOT ALL THE TIME.
YOU1000000136_S0000032	PATRICK HAS COME TO NORWAY TO FIND OUT HOW THE RAF'S 9TH SQUADRON AND 617 SQUADRON, THE DAM BUSTERS, FINALLY MANAGED TO SINK THE UNSINKABLE BATTLESHIP.
YOU1000000136_S0000033	THIS DAY IS ALWAYS COMMEMORATED AS TIRPITZ DAY BY 617 SQUADRON, BUT IT COULD BE REMEMBERED IN A VERY DIFFERENT FASHION. IT COULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED AS THE DAY THAT 617 SQUADRON WAS ANNIHILATED.
YOU1000000136_S0000034	IT'S AN ENDURING MYSTERY. WHY WAS IT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IN THEIR BOMB AND GET AWAY WITH NO LOSSES? IT COULD HAVE GONE VERY, VERY DIFFERENTLY.
YOU1000000136_S0000036	70 YEARS AGO, THE TIRPITZ WAS THE GREATEST SINGLE MARITIME THREAT TO THE ALLIES.
YOU1000000136_S0000038	AT 35 MILES AN HOUR, IT WAS FASTER THAN ANY BRITISH BATTLESHIP.
YOU1000000136_S0000040	ITS EIGHT 15 INCH GUNS COULD FIRE 17 MILES BEYOND THE HORIZON. IT COULD SINK YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN SAW IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000042	ITS ARMOR WAS SO THICK THAT CONVENTIONAL BOMBS BOUNCED OFF IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000044	AN IMPRESSIVE GIANT OF A SHIP, TIRPITZ, WAS BUILT TO BE AS NEARLY UNSINKABLE AS A SHIP COULD BE.
YOU1000000136_S0000046	WHEN HITLER LAUNCHED THE TIRPITZ ON APRIL 1ST 1939, IT WAS WORLDWIDE NEWS. TEENAGER TONY IVERSON WAS MESMERIZED BY THE FLICKERING IMAGES.
YOU1000000136_S0000048	I REMEMBER SEEING IN A CINEMA IN YORK WHERE I LIVED, SEEING A NEWSREEL OF THIS BATTLESHIP, THIS HUGE THING. I HAD NO IDEA WHEN I SAW THIS WITH MY GIRLFRIEND THAT ONE DAY I MIGHT BE LINKED WITH TIRPITZ.
YOU1000000136_S0000050	TONY WAS PART OF A GENERATION WHO GREW UP WITH THE ROMANCE OF FLYING.
YOU1000000136_S0000051	EVERY YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD WANTED TO FLY. IT DIDN'T HURT SOMETIMES ON A SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN YOU'D COME BACK TO THE LOCAL DANCE.
YOU1000000136_S0000052	WHEN YOU HOPED A GIRL WOULD SAY, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TODAY? YOU COULD SAY, OH, WELL, I'VE JUST BEEN DICING WITH DEATH IN THE HEAVENS.
YOU1000000136_S0000054	TONY, NOW 94, FLEW SPITFIRES IN THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN. HE THEN JOINED THE ELITE BOMBER FORCE, THE DAM BUSTERS.
YOU1000000136_S0000056	IN 1943, THE DAM BUSTERS 617 SQUADRON HAD BREACHED THE RUHR DAMS USING INVENTOR BARNES WALLACE'S BOUNCING BOMB. THE SQUADRON BECAME THE RAF'S EXPERTS IN PRECISION BOMBING.
YOU1000000136_S0000058	A YEAR AFTER THE DAMS RAID, MOST OF THE SQUADRON HAD MOVED ON OR HAD BEEN KILLED IN ACTION. IT WAS TIME FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE BEST YOUNG FLYERS.
YOU1000000136_S0000060	I WAS AT UNIVERSITY AND I DECIDED THAT THE AIR FORCE REALLY WAS FOR ME. I MADE THE BIG MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT TWO AND TWO MADE FOUR. I SHOULD HAVE SAID FIVE.
YOU1000000136_S0000062	AND BECAUSE I SAID FOUR, I BECAME A NAVIGATOR AND I WAS NOT VERY PLEASED AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A PILOT.
YOU1000000136_S0000063	I WAS A STUDENT AND I WAS DOING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE ARMY, I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE NAVY, AND I THOUGHT THE AIR FORCE SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD, BUT I WAS ALWAYS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT MY EYES BECAUSE THEY
YOU1000000136_S0000064	THEY WEREN'T REALLY AS GOOD AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN, SO I JUST LEARNT THE LIES, THE BOTTOM LINE OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT THEY WERE BEING ASKED, AND REELED THAT OFF AND PASSED THE EYE TEST.
YOU1000000136_S0000066	WITHIN MONTHS OF JOINING THE DAMBUSTERS, THE NEW CREWS AND THEIR LANCASTER BOMBERS WOULD BE FIGHTING IN ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000068	AFTER THE GERMAN OCCUPATION OF NORWAY, THE ARCTIC CIRCLE BECAME ONE OF THE KEY BATTLEGROUNDS OF THE CONFLICT.
YOU1000000136_S0000069	IN JANUARY 1942, HITLER ORDERED HIS BIGGEST BATTLESHIP, NORTH, TO THREATEN THE ARCTIC CONVOYS DELIVERING ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES TO THE RUSSIANS.
YOU1000000136_S0000071	CHURCHILL PROMISED STALIN THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN THIS LIFELINE. WITHOUT IT, THE SOVIET WAR EFFORT WOULD COLLAPSE.
YOU1000000136_S0000073	IN JUNE 1942, THE LARGEST ARCTIC CONVOY OF THE WAR, 35 MERCHANT SHIPS, SET SAIL ESCORTED BY 43 WARSHIPS. THEY WERE ONLY TOO WELL AWARE THAT THE TIRPITZ WAS POISED TO POUNCE.
YOU1000000136_S0000075	THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT'S GOING TO PUT TO SEA IS ENOUGH TO CREATE WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED, I THINK, AS PANIC.
YOU1000000136_S0000077	THE RUMOR CAUSED THE ADMIRALTY TO ISSUE A FATAL ORDER.
YOU1000000136_S0000079	THE CONVOY IS TO SCATTER. THAT MEANS THAT THE ESCORT, THIS MASSIVE ESCORT THEY'VE GATHERED, IS TO RETURN HOME AND THAT THESE MERCHANT MEN ARE BASICALLY ON THEIR OWN. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY DECISION.
YOU1000000136_S0000080	AND OF THOSE SHIPS THAT SET OUT, ONLY 11 ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO PORT. THERE'S SOME, NOT BY TIRPITZ, BUT BY GERMAN SUBMARINES AND THE LUFTWAFFE, WHO HAVE A FIELD DAY. SO WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT,
YOU1000000136_S0000081	TIRPITZ HAD ACTUALLY SCORED AN ENORMOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL VICTORY AGAINST THE ALLIES.
YOU1000000136_S0000083	THIS, THE BIGGEST ARCTIC CONVOY LOSS OF THE WAR, PROVOKED A FURIOUS RESPONSE FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL.
YOU1000000136_S0000085	THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS SHIP IS THE GREATEST EVENT AT SEA AT THE PRESENT TIME. NO OTHER TARGET IS COMPARABLE TO IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000087	WITH ROYAL NAVY SHIPS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN THE FAR EAST, THE BRITISH THREW EVERYTHING AT THE TIRPITZ, INCLUDING DIVE BOMBERS, MANNED TORPEDOES AND MIDGET SUBMARINES.
YOU1000000136_S0000089	IN TWO YEARS, 31 ATTEMPTS FAILED TO SINK THE PHANTOM MENACE.
YOU1000000136_S0000091	SO CHURCHILL CALLED IN THE DAM BUSTERS TO FINALLY FINISH THE JOB.
YOU1000000136_S0000093	THEY WOULD HAVE JUST TWO MONTHS TO SINK THE UNSINKABLE TIRPITZ BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE ARCTIC WINTER.
YOU1000000136_S0000095	IF THEY FAILED, THE BRITISH NAVY IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC WOULD BE TIED UP UNTIL THE SPRING.
YOU1000000136_S0000097	THE DAMBUSTERS WERE TO BE JOINED BY 9 SQUADRON, ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED IN THE RAF.
YOU1000000136_S0000098	WE WERE CALLED TO A SPECIAL BRIEFING AT WOODHALL SPA AT OUR FRIEND'S BASE WHERE THEIR WING COMMANDER FLYING, A MAN CALLED TATE,
YOU1000000136_S0000099	TOOK US INTO A BRIEFING ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN TOTALLY BLACKED OUT, SO WE KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.
YOU1000000136_S0000101	AND HE WAS A FAIRLY DRAMATIC MAN AND HE ENJOYED HAVING US ALL SIT DOWN AND THEN SUDDENLY DRAWING THE CLOTH OF A MODEL IN FRONT OF HIM.
YOU1000000136_S0000102	WHICH WAS OF COURSE THE TIRPITZ. GASP FROM EVERYBODY.
YOU1000000136_S0000104	THE BEAST WAS HIDING AT THE NORTHERN TIP OF NORWAY, WELL OUT OF THE RANGE OF A DIRECT ATTACK FROM BRITAIN. SO THE RAF CAME UP WITH A DARING PLAN.
YOU1000000136_S0000106	WE WERE TOLD TO PRACTICE A LOT OF DINGHY DRILL. WELL, DINGHY DRILL WAS THE PROCEDURE FOR GETTING OUT OF AN AEROPLANE IF YOU HAD TO LAND IT IN THE SEA.
YOU1000000136_S0000108	THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE SHIP BY THE SOVIET UNION.
YOU1000000136_S0000110	ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, THE TWO SQUADRONS TOOK OFF ON AN UNPRECEDENTED 3,400 MILE MISSION.
YOU1000000136_S0000112	THEY FIRST FLEW THE 1,100 MILES TO RUSSIA.
YOU1000000136_S0000114	THEN, AFTER REFUELING, AND AT THE VERY LIMIT OF A LANCASTER'S RANGE, THEY FLEW ON TO BOMB THE TIRPITZ.
YOU1000000136_S0000116	IN THEIR BOMBAYS THEY WERE CARRYING THE NEW BARNES WALLACE DESIGNED 12,000 POUND TALLBOY.
YOU1000000136_S0000118	IT WAS A REVOLUTIONARY PRECISION WEAPON. IN THE RIGHT HANDS, IT FLEW LIKE A DART.
YOU1000000136_S0000120	BARNES WALLACE HAS DESIGNED IT SO IT DIDN'T TUMBLE OVER LIKE A BOMB MIGHT. IT WAS DROPPED AND FLEW DIRECTLY ONTO THE POINT IT WAS AIMED AT, I HOPE.
YOU1000000136_S0000121	THE TALLBOY WAS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED, IF YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT A BOMB. IT HAD FINS AT THE REAR SO THAT WHEN IT FELL, IT WENT INTO A SPIN. THAT MEANT IT WAS FLYING VERY ACCURATELY.
YOU1000000136_S0000123	THE RAID WOULD HAVE SUCH PROPAGANDA VALUE THAT A FILM CAMERA WENT ALONG TO RECORD IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000125	AFTER A SIX HOUR FLIGHT FROM RUSSIA, THE LANCASTERS APPROACHED THE TARGET.
YOU1000000136_S0000126	I COULD SEE TIRPITZ OVER THE FRONT OF MY LANCASTER AND ABOUT THE SAME TIME I SAW ALL THE SMOKE GENERATORS START UP AND THEY HAD ABOUT 200 PLUS SO THEY FILLED THE FJORD.
YOU1000000136_S0000127	VERY RAPIDLY WITH SMOKE, BECAUSE MY BOMB EMISSARY SAID, IT'S NO GOOD SKIP, I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. SO WE JUST HAD TO GO.
YOU1000000136_S0000129	MOST OF THE TALL BOYS PLUNGED HARMLESSLY INTO THE SMOKE SCREEN. BUT HAVING SURVIVED THIS ATTACK, THE TIRPITZ WAS NOW FORCED TO MAKE A FATAL MOVE.
YOU1000000136_S0000130	IN 1944, DESPITE FIVE YEARS OF CONFLICT, THE CREW OF THE TIRPITZ WAS LARGELY IMMUNE TO THE HARDSHIPS OF THE WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000132	HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP HAS COME TO TROMSO'S TIRPITZ MUSEUM, LOCATED IN A FORMER GERMAN BUNKER.
YOU1000000136_S0000134	HE'S EXPLORING THE DAILY ROUTINE ON BOARD WITH CURATOR LEIF ARNEBURG.
YOU1000000136_S0000136	SO THIS IS LIKE YOUR WEEKLY TOBACCO RATION? YEAH.
YOU1000000136_S0000137	BUT UNDER THE CARDINAL.
YOU1000000136_S0000138	WHAT DO WE GOT?
YOU1000000136_S0000139	SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
YOU1000000136_S0000140	AH, MY GOSH, I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT IS, DON'T WE?
YOU1000000136_S0000142	TOBACCO AND CONDOMS.
YOU1000000136_S0000143	HMM.
YOU1000000136_S0000144	TWO STAPLES OF THE SEAMEN'S EQUIPMENT.
YOU1000000136_S0000145	THAT IS A CUP FOR COFFEE FROM THE SHIP, TAKEN OUT BY SOME OF THE WORKERS WHO WERE CUTTING THE SHIP AFTER THE WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000146	SO IT'S A NICE BIT OF CROCKERY THAT, ISN'T IT? IT LOOKS LIKE THEY LIVED PRETTY WELL.
YOU1000000136_S0000148	THE SHIP HAD A CREW OF 2,400 MEN. IT WAS SO LARGE, IT RAN ITS OWN BAKERY, CINEMA AND POST OFFICE. IT EVEN PRODUCED ITS OWN NEWSPAPER.
YOU1000000136_S0000150	WAS 21 YEARS OLD WHEN HE FIRST STEPPED ON BOARD THE 42,200 TON TIRPITZ.
YOU1000000136_S0000152	WE WERE YOUNG AND WE WERE PROUD AND THE GIRLS LOOKED FOR OUR NICE BLUE UNIFORM, YOU UNDERSTAND.
YOU1000000136_S0000154	GERMAN TROOPS RETREATED ON ALL FRONTS AND STARVING GERMAN CIVILIANS FACED DAILY ATTACKS ON THEIR CITIES. LIFE ON THE TIRPITZ REMAINED LARGELY UNAFFECTED.
YOU1000000136_S0000156	WE HAD GOOD FOOD AND CLEAN ROOMS, CLEAN WASH. THREE DAYS IN THE WEEK WE HAD MEAT.
YOU1000000136_S0000157	AND IN THE EVENING, WE HAVE A...
YOU1000000136_S0000159	BUT IN OCTOBER 1944, AS SOVIET FORCES ADVANCED INTO NORWAY, THE TIRPITZ WAS MOVED 120 MILES SOUTH TO GERMANY.
YOU1000000136_S0000161	IT WAS A FATAL MISTAKE. THE SHIP WAS NOW ALMOST WITHIN RANGE OF A DIRECT ATTACK.
YOU1000000136_S0000163	THE NEWS ENCOURAGED CHURCHILL TO PILE ON THE PRESSURE.
YOU1000000136_S0000165	I CONSIDER THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ATTACK THIS SHIP, EVEN IF LOSSES HAVE TO BE INCURRED.
YOU1000000136_S0000167	THE RAF WENT INTO A FRENZY OF ACTIVITY. IF THE LANCASTER BOMBERS WERE COMPLETELY STRIPPED OF EXCESS WEIGHT AND FILLED WITH EXTRA FUEL, THEY MIGHT JUST REACH THEIR TARGET.
YOU1000000136_S0000169	OUR ENGINES WERE CHANGED AND ARMOUR WAS TAKEN OUT, THE ONE BEHIND THE PILOT'S SEAT WAS TAKEN OUT, THERE WAS A BIG PIECE OF ARMOUR PLATING. THEY HAD TO REDUCE THE WEIGHT, SO THEY TOOK OUT THE MID UPPER TURRET IN ITS ENTIRETY.
YOU1000000136_S0000170	THEY TOOK THE GUNS OUT OF THE FRONT TURRET AND REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION IN THE REAR TURRET.
YOU1000000136_S0000172	LOSING WEIGHT INCREASED RANGE, BUT THE LANCASTERS NEEDED TO CARRY MUCH MORE 100 OCTANE AVIATION FUEL TO GET THEM TO TROMSO.
YOU1000000136_S0000174	THE EXTRA FUEL TANKS WAS A WELLINGTON TANK.
YOU1000000136_S0000176	OF 200 GALLONS AND A MOSQUITO TANK OF 50 GALLONS, ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER, PLACED INSIDE THE FUSELAGE WHERE THE REST BED WOULD HAVE BEEN.
YOU1000000136_S0000177	AND IT WAS SO DANGEROUS THAT GROUND CREW HAD TO WEAR PLIMSOLLS BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF A SPARK IF THEY WORE THEIR BOOTS. AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BLOW UP THE WHOLE AIRCRAFT, AT LEAST ONE, PERHAPS SEVERAL MORE AROUND IT AS WELL.
YOU1000000136_S0000178	I HAVE TO SAY THAT DESPITE ALL THE FUEL JOINTS BEING THOROUGHLY TIGHT AND NO SIGN OF ANY LEAKAGE, YOU STILL COULD SMELL THAT 100 OCTANE.
YOU1000000136_S0000179	SO IT MADE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT SICK, I SUPPOSE.
YOU1000000136_S0000181	ON OCTOBER 29, 1944, THE REFITTED LANCASTERS OF 617 AND 9 SQUADRONS TOOK OFF ON A 13 HOUR NON STOP MISSION.
YOU1000000136_S0000183	TO SUCCEED, THE UNDEFENDED PLAINS NEEDED TO TAKE THE TIRPITZ BY SURPRISE.
YOU1000000136_S0000185	THEY CROSSED THE NORWEGIAN COAST, WHERE THEY KNEW THERE WAS A GAP IN ENEMY RADAR, AND THEY USED NEUTRAL SWEDEN TO DISGUISE THEIR APPROACH.
YOU1000000136_S0000187	EVERYTHING WAS IN PLACE TO FINALLY SEND THE TIRPITZ TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.
YOU1000000136_S0000189	BUT THE ONE THING NOT IN THEIR CONTROL WAS THE WEATHER.
YOU1000000136_S0000191	JUST 30 SECONDS BEFORE BOMBING COMMENCED, TIRPITZ WAS COVERED BY A BLANKET OF LOW CLOUD.
YOU1000000136_S0000193	BUT MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T BOMB, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE THE TIRPITZ. IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING, ALL THAT PREPARATION AND ALL THAT HARD WORK AND ALL THAT FLYING.
YOU1000000136_S0000194	AND TO ARRIVE TOGETHER AT THE RIGHT TIME OVER THE RIGHT POINT AND THEN TO BE WASTED IS, I WON'T SAY DISHEARTENING, BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DISHEARTENED, WE WERE ANNOYED PERHAPS.
YOU1000000136_S0000196	BUT AFTER THE FAILURE OF THIS RAID, THERE WAS TO BE NO LET UP. THE CREWS WERE ORDERED BACK AGAIN.
YOU1000000136_S0000198	THERE WAS NO TIME TO PLAN A NEW ROUTE, AND THERE WAS ONE MORE SHOCK IN STORE FOR THEM.
YOU1000000136_S0000199	THEY SAID, SORRY TO TELL YOU CHAPS, BUT SINCE THE LAST TRIP, THE GERMANS HAVE MOVED TWO SQUADRONS OF FIGHTERS TO BE NEAR THE TIRPITZ AT BAVARIA.
YOU1000000136_S0000201	IN NO WAY.
YOU1000000136_S0000202	WELL, THIS MADE US SWALLOW A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000136_S0000203	WE WERE A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE HADN'T GOT THE MID APOTERY BUT
YOU1000000136_S0000205	BUT NEW EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED THAT SUGGESTS THE DAM BUSTERS AND NINE SQUADRON WERE IN EVEN GREATER DANGER THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED.
YOU1000000136_S0000207	IN NOVEMBER 1944, THE RAF WAS PREPARING TO ATTACK THE BATTLESHIP TIRPITZ FOR THE THIRD TIME IN TWO MONTHS. THE BRITISH WERE STILL HOPING TO TAKE THE NAZIS BY SURPRISE, EVEN THOUGH THEY'D BE FLYING THE SAME ROUTE.
YOU1000000136_S0000209	BUT NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE GERMANS MAY HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THEM.
YOU1000000136_S0000211	ON THE NORWEGIAN ISLAND OF ANDORRA, HISTORIAN PATRICK BISHOP IS INVESTIGATING A STORY THAT THE GERMANS REPOSITIONED SOME OF THEIR RADAR BEFORE THE THIRD RAID.
YOU1000000136_S0000213	PATRICK HAS COME TO THE SITE OF A WASSERMANN RADAR INSTALLATION, THE MOST POWERFUL GERMAN RADAR OF THE CONFLICT. HE'S WITH LOCAL RESIDENT JOHN RONALD NORHEIM, WHO HAS BROUGHT ALONG A PHOTOGRAPH HIS FATHER TOOK AT THE END OF THE WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000215	HITLER HAD THIS OBSESSION WITH THE IDEA THAT THE ALLIES, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SURE NORMANDY LANDINGS HAD GONE AHEAD, HE STILL CLUNG TO THIS BELIEF THAT THERE'D BE AN ALLIED LANDING IN NORWAY AS WELL.
YOU1000000136_S0000216	THAT WAS I WAS.
YOU1000000136_S0000217	I WAS TOLD THAT THE ISRAELI WAS PICKING UP ALL THE SHIP TRAFFIC GOING TOWARDS RUSSIA.
YOU1000000136_S0000218	NOW, IF WE LOOK AT THIS PICTURE HERE, WE'VE GOT THIS LANDMARK, WHICH IS VERY PROMINENT.
YOU1000000136_S0000219	ROCKY ISLAND JUST BEHIND US AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE PICTURE. THIS BOX STRUCTURE THAT'S ON THE BACK OF THE SCAFFOLDING IF YOU LIKE IS ACTUALLY THE REAR OF THE RADAR SET. SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE
YOU1000000136_S0000220	THE THING IS ACTUALLY, THE VASAMIN IS POINTING INLAND. IT'S NOT POINTING OUT TO SEA WHERE YOU MIGHT EXPECT IT TO BE.
YOU1000000136_S0000221	THIS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE WASSERMAN RADAR TO ACTUALLY PICK UP THE RAID AS IT CAME IN, AS IT HONED IN ON TROMSO TO BOMB THE TIRPITZ.
YOU1000000136_S0000223	WITH THE RADAR REPOSITIONED TO TRACK THE FLYERS COMING FROM INLAND, ALL IT NEEDED WAS ONE PHONE CALL TO THE FIGHTER SQUADRON AT BARDEFOSS.
YOU1000000136_S0000225	IN JUST 13 MINUTES, THE FIGHTERS WOULD BE SWARMING AROUND THE TIRPITZ, READY TO SHOOT THE LANCASTERS OUT OF THE SKY.
YOU1000000136_S0000227	ONE OF THOSE CRACK FIGHTER PILOTS AT BADAFOSS NOW LIVES HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
YOU1000000136_S0000229	KURT SCHULTZ, AGE 92, MEETS WITH A GROUP OF VETERAN FLYERS EVERY WEEK.
YOU1000000136_S0000231	70 YEARS AGO, HE WOULDN'T HAVE HESITATED TO SHOOT THEM DOWN.
YOU1000000136_S0000233	IT'S A FRIENDSHIP THAT HAS DEVELOPED AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT BECAUSE I WAS THE ENEMY.
YOU1000000136_S0000235	KURT STARTED THE WAR AS A NAVIGATOR ON BOMBING RAIDS OVER ENGLAND.
YOU1000000136_S0000237	BUT LATER HE BECAME A FIGHTER PILOT. HE WAS POSTED TO A SQUADRON OF FIGHTER ACES BASED DEEP INSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR THEIR RELAXED ATTITUDE TO DISCIPLINE.
YOU1000000136_S0000239	I ARRIVED JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY HAD TRIED TO KILL HITLER. AND YOU KNOW, THE SALUTE WAS LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000136_S0000241	ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ALL WALKED IN. AND INSTEAD OF GREETING LIKE THAT, THEY GREETED LIKE THAT. AND YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT, GEE, KURT, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? SO, BUT IT WAS A VERY LOOSE BUNCH.
YOU1000000136_S0000242	AS FAR AS REAL DISCIPLINE WAS CONCERNED, BUT THEY WERE VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL.
YOU1000000136_S0000244	KURT FLEW 63 MISSIONS AND HAD THREE CONFIRMED KILLS. SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES AT BARDEFOSS WERE AMONG THE HIGHEST SCORING ACES OF THE WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000246	HE HAD 199 VICTORIES AND I THINK CAPTAIN DOERR, WHO WAS A GROUP COMMANDER, HAD MAYBE 160.
YOU1000000136_S0000248	THESE THREE TOGETHER HAD 600 VICTORIES ALMOST.
YOU1000000136_S0000250	AS THE LANCASTERS TOOK OFF IN THE EARLY HOURS OF NOVEMBER THE 12TH FROM THE FROZEN COASTLINE OF NORTHERN SCOTLAND, THE FIGHTERS AT BADAFOS WERE PREYING ON THEIR MINDS.
YOU1000000136_S0000252	THIS WOULD BE THEIR LAST CHANCE TO SINK THE TIRPITZ BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE ARCTIC WINTER.
YOU1000000136_S0000254	IT WAS COLD, BUT WHEN YOU'RE 20, 21, YOU DON'T FEEL COLD, BUT IT WAS COLD. IF WE WANTED TO HAVE A PEE, SOME KIND OF WAFF,
YOU1000000136_S0000255	IN THE MESS AT LOSSIE HAD PROVIDED MILK BOTTLES AND OF COURSE THERE WAS A HUGE JOKE ABOUT THOSE.
YOU1000000136_S0000257	LOOKING BACK, THEY JUST PITCHED US INTO IT AS IT WERE. THERE'S THE TARGET. YOU'VE GOT THE WEAPON. GO AND DO IT. AT THE TIME, WE JUST GOT ON AND DID IT.
YOU1000000136_S0000259	THAT WAS OUR JOB.
YOU1000000136_S0000260	IT WAS A LONG, LONG JOURNEY. THERE WAS NO RADIO CONTACT, OF COURSE. THE ONLY WAY WE COULD NAVIGATE, I COULD NAVIGATE ANYHOW, WAS TAKE THE ODD SHOT OF WHICHEVER STAR WAS APPROPRIATE.
YOU1000000136_S0000261	AND JUST KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED.
YOU1000000136_S0000263	AT 7 A.M., THE BOMBERS TURNED EAST THROUGH WHAT THEY STILL BELIEVED WAS A RADAR GAP. BUT GERMAN RECORDS SHOW THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN SPOTTED.
YOU1000000136_S0000264	DEFENSELESS, LADEN WITH FUEL, AND WITH TWO AND A HALF TONS OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES INSIDE THEIR TALL BOY BOMBS, THEY WERE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE.
YOU1000000136_S0000265	WE FOUND WE WERE FLYING INTO A GIN CLEAR SKY, WHICH WAS PERFECT FOR OUR JOB, ABSOLUTELY. BUT THEN ONE LITTLE THOUGHT CAME, WELL, IT'LL SUIT THE FIGHTERS PRETTY WELL TOO.
YOU1000000136_S0000267	AT 7.40, THE LANCASTERS BEGAN THEIR RUN INTO THE TARGET FROM NEUTRAL SWEDEN.
YOU1000000136_S0000269	THE TIRPITZ WAS ALREADY RECEIVING INFORMATION OF CONFUSED SIGHTINGS. SOME PLACING BOMBERS ON A COURSE TO RUSSIA, OTHERS PLACING THEM A HUNDRED KILOMETERS TO THE NORTH.
YOU1000000136_S0000271	NO ONE ALERTED THE BADAFOS AIR BASE.
YOU1000000136_S0000273	THEN AT 8.09, THE TIRPITZ ON ITS OWN RADAR SPOTTED THE BOMBER FORCE JUST 30 MINUTES AWAY. AND IT WAS COMING STRAIGHT AT THEM.
YOU1000000136_S0000275	THE ALARM FINALLY SOUNDED AT THE BARDEFOSS FIGHTER BASE AT 8.18. THIS WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR AFTER THE RAIDERS HAD FIRST BEEN SPOTTED.
YOU1000000136_S0000277	SIX MINUTES LATER, THE LANCASTERS PASSED A FEW MILES TO THE EAST OF BADAFOS, ON THEIR WAY NORTH.
YOU1000000136_S0000279	MINE THOUGHT WAS, HOPE TO CHRIST THE FIGHTERS DON'T GET NEAR US. IF I GOT A 109 OFF MY BACKSIDE, THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE LEFT FOR ME FINISHED WITH HIS CANNON.
YOU1000000136_S0000281	AT 8.30, KURT SCHULTZ ARRIVED AT HIS MESSERSCHMITT 109 FIGHTER. HAD HE TAKEN OFF THEN, HE COULD STILL HAVE CAUGHT THE LANCASTERS. BUT KURT AND HIS COLLEAGUES LOST VITAL MINUTES GETTING OFF THE GROUND.
YOU1000000136_S0000283	FOR A START, THE PLANES WERE AT THE WRONG END OF THE RUNWAY. AND THEN AT THE MOMENT THEY WERE READY TO TAKE OFF, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ALLOWED A TRANSPORT PLANE TO LAND.
YOU1000000136_S0000285	SO THEY LET THIS U 52 THAT WAS COMING FLY IN AND LAND DOWN THE HILL. AND SO THERE WAS ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES LOST.
YOU1000000136_S0000289	JUST BEFORE 8.30AM, THE LANCASTERS BEGAN THEIR APPROACH TO THE TIRPITZ. RAF CAMERAS WERE AGAIN ON HAND TO FILM IT ALL. SO FAR THERE WAS STILL NO SIGN OF KURT AND HIS FIGHTERS.
YOU1000000136_S0000291	IT WAS A SUNDAY, YES. I WAS STANDING ON THE DECK. THEN CAME THE ALARM.
YOU1000000136_S0000292	AND WE SAW THE MACHINE IN SOUTH.
YOU1000000136_S0000294	AS THE LANCASTERS APPROACHED, THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY THE FIRST OF TIRPITZ'S FORMIDABLE WEAPONRY. THE SHIP TRAINED ITS MASSIVE 15 INCH GUNS ONTO THE RAIDERS. EACH SHELL WEIGHED MORE THAN A TON.
YOU1000000136_S0000296	THE TIRPITZ GUNS HAD A RANGE OF 17 MILES. EVEN THE BIG HEAVY GUNS COULD BE ELEVATED TO REACH AIRCRAFT.
YOU1000000136_S0000298	IT WAS A GREAT UNFOLDING ORANGE CLOUD. THIS 15 INCH SHELL WENT OFF. IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY TAKEN TWO LANCASTERS OUT OF THE SKY TOGETHER.
YOU1000000136_S0000300	YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THESE SHELLS COMING UP. THEY SEEMED TO COME UP SO SLOWLY. IT WAS A FASCINATING SIGHT. YOU'D NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT AGAIN.
YOU1000000136_S0000302	WITHIN A MINUTE, THE REST OF TIRPITZ'S DEFENCES OPENED UP ON THE ADVANCING BOMBERS.
YOU1000000136_S0000304	MY COMBAT STATION WAS THE ANTI AIR GUN.
YOU1000000136_S0000305	YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO THE GERMAN GUNNERS. THEY GOT THE ALTITUDE ABSOLUTELY COCK ON. I MEAN, WE WERE 15,200 FEET, AND THE FLAK WAS BURSTING EXACTLY AT THAT LEVEL.
YOU1000000136_S0000306	BUT WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT EARLY. THE FLAK WAS IN FRONT OF US BY A MATTER OF A FEW YARDS.
YOU1000000136_S0000307	WHEN THE FUEL IN A 200 GALLON TANK IS USED UP, THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES DANGEROUS, BECAUSE SHOULD A BIT OF FLAK GET THROUGH, IT'S GOING TO HIT SORT OF VAPORIZED FUEL.
YOU1000000136_S0000308	HOW DO YOU FEEL? I MUST ADMIT, YOU'RE A BIT EXCITED AND THINK, CHRIST, I HOPE THEY DON'T HIT US.
YOU1000000136_S0000309	I HAD TO GET THAT AEROPLANE POSITIONED. SO THE BOMB WENT DOWN TO HIT THIS TARGET, WHICH FROM 15,000 FEET MUST HAVE LOOKED TO MY BOMB, LIKE A DINKY TOY, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 900 FEET LONG.
YOU1000000136_S0000311	THE FIRST TORBOY WAS RELEASED AT 8.41. IT SCORED A DIRECT HIT.
YOU1000000136_S0000313	THE NEXT FIVE RECORD IN ANOTHER DIRECT HIT, THREE NEAR MISSES AND A STRAY.
YOU1000000136_S0000315	YEAH, YOU COULD SEE IT GO DOWN LIKE A DART ALMOST, BECAUSE IT WAS PAINTED BRIGHT GREEN. YEAH. AND IT LOOKED QUITE NICE, ACTUALLY, DIVING DOWN THERE.
YOU1000000136_S0000316	IT WENT THROUGH THE SPEED OF SOUND. SO WHAT THESE POOR SAILORS FELT WHEN ONE OR TWO OF THEM LANDED. WHEN THE MACHINE COME, ARE COMING AGAINST YOU, YOU HAVE
YOU1000000136_S0000317	YOU CANNOT GET AIR ENOUGH. IT'S SO AS ONE PRESSED YOUR AIR.
YOU1000000136_S0000319	AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF SIX BOMBERS, TONY IVERSON WAS IN THE SECOND WAVE OF THREE. HE ATTACKED AT 8.42.
YOU1000000136_S0000320	I BOMBED AT NUMBER 7 OR NUMBER 8. AND I THINK I HAD A NEAR MISS OR A NOT SO NEAR MISS. I'M NOT SURE. I'VE NEVER... I CAN'T GO FURTHER THAN THAT.
YOU1000000136_S0000322	THIS SECOND WAVE SCORED TWO VERY NEAR MISSES. THE BOMBS WERE BEGINNING TO OVERWHELM THE SHIP.
YOU1000000136_S0000324	THE FIRST BOMB HAD LANDED MID SHIPS. IT LED TO ONE OF THE MAGAZINES BLOWING UP. BOMB 4 HAD HIT CLOSE TO A TURRET AND BLEW IT INTO THE AIR. BOMBS 5, 7, 9 AND 14
YOU1000000136_S0000325	...HAD LANDED CLOSE BY. THESE ALSO HAD A DEVASTATING EFFECT... ...PRODUCING SHOCKWAVES THAT BUCKLED THE SHIP'S FRAME... ...AND CAUSED IT TO START TO CAPSIZE.
YOU1000000136_S0000327	THE FIRST NINE AIRCRAFT BOMBED IN ONE AND A HALF MINUTES, THAT'S 90 SECONDS. YOU CAN COUNT 90 SECONDS. JUST THINK OF NINE FIVE TON BOMBS COMING DOWN AT YOU.
YOU1000000136_S0000329	NINE SQUADRON FOLLOWED UP, DROPPING THEIR TALLBOYS INTO THE SMOKE. AS THEY EXPLODED, FEW WERE CERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME.
YOU1000000136_S0000331	THERE WAS SMOKE UP AT THE ONE END. I SUPPOSE IT WAS THE POINTED END, I THINK.
YOU1000000136_S0000332	BUT THE REAR GUNNER WAS QUITE CONVINCED. BLOODY THINGS GOING ON, I'LL SKIP.
YOU1000000136_S0000334	AS THE LANCASTERS TURNED AWAY FROM THE TARGET, THEY KNEW THE DANGER WASN'T OVER YET.
YOU1000000136_S0000336	WE REALISED WE HADN'T SEEN ANY FIGHTERS, WHICH IS...
YOU1000000136_S0000338	AMAZING, AMAZING LUCK.
YOU1000000136_S0000340	THEY WERE LUCKIER THAN THEY COULD HAVE IMAGINED. THE FIRST GERMAN FIGHTERS WERE LESS THAN THREE MINUTES AWAY AS THE LAST BOMB WAS DROPPED.
YOU1000000136_S0000342	IT TOOK ME APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES TO GET TO TROMSEY FROM BADEFOSS. AND WHEN I ARRIVED THERE, THE TIRPITZ WAS ALREADY TURNING OVER.
YOU1000000136_S0000344	SO I TURNED AROUND AND FLEW BACK. THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.
YOU1000000136_S0000346	THE COURT HAD ONLY JUST MISSED THE DEFENCELESS LANCASTERS. ALL THE CREWS RETURNED HOME SAFELY. WAS IT LUCK? OR WERE THERE OTHER FORCES AT WORK?
YOU1000000136_S0000348	THE SINKING OF THE BATTLESHIP TIRPITZ, AFTER 33 FAILED ATTEMPTS, WAS A REMARKABLE FEAT OF NAVIGATION, FLYING AND PRECISION BOMBING. BUT IT HAD A TERRIBLE HUMAN COST.
YOU1000000136_S0000350	1,700 SAILORS WERE ON BOARD AS THE SHIP BEGAN TO CAPSIZE.
YOU1000000136_S0000352	I SAW NOT THE EXPLOSION FROM THE HIT ON THE SHIP, BUT I FEEL THE QUAKE. YOU HAVE, YOU ARE FEELING THAT THE SHIP MAKE A JUMP FROM A HALF METER.
YOU1000000136_S0000353	AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT, THE SHIP BEGAN TO CAPSIZE. IT GOES SO AND SO, AND AT LAST WE'RE HANGING IN THE RAINING HERE.
YOU1000000136_S0000354	AND I GO A MOMENT LATER INTO THE WATER, YES. AND THEN I SWIM TO THE COASTLINE. AND THE WATER WAS OIL. AND...
YOU1000000136_S0000356	MANY OF THE
YOU1000000136_S0000358	LAY, HAVE THEIR FACE IN THE WATER, THEY WERE DYING. AND, UH, I SEE IT, IT WAS CRAZY. IT LOOKS AS WHEN
YOU1000000136_S0000359	THE FOOTBALLS WERE SWIMMING IN THE WATER. A CRAZY SIGHT.
YOU1000000136_S0000361	WILLIBALD WÖLSING WAS BELOW DECKS WHEN THE SHIP CAPSIZED.
YOU1000000136_S0000363	21 YEAR OLD KARL HEINZ KERSLING WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ON SHORE AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK.
YOU1000000136_S0000365	HE RUSHED TO THE RESCUE OF THE HUNDREDS OF SAILORS TRAPPED INSIDE THE HULL.
YOU1000000136_S0000367	AS THE TIDE ROSE, THE COMPARTMENTS BEGAN TO FILL WITH WATER. THE RESCUERS COULD HEAR THEIR ENTOMBED COMRADES SINGING DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER ALLES UNTIL THE VOICES FELL SILENT.
YOU1000000136_S0000369	971 SAILORS LOST THEIR LIVES, BUT THE BEAST HAD BEEN SLAIN.
YOU1000000136_S0000371	LOOKING BACK, IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE THAT THE RAIDERS MANAGED TO GET AWAY WITH IT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S THE DEFENDERS WHO'VE ACTUALLY GOT THE ODDS.
YOU1000000136_S0000372	STACKED IN THEIR FAVOR. YOU'VE GOT THE SQUADRON OF CRACK FIGHTERS BASED NEARBY.
YOU1000000136_S0000374	APPARENTLY WITH THE SPECIFIC JOB OF LOOKING AFTER THE TIRPITZ. YOU'VE GOT THE RADAR SYSTEMS APPARENTLY POINTING INWARDS, YET THERE WE ARE AT THE END OF THAT MORNING, THE TIRPITZ IS SUNK.
YOU1000000136_S0000375	AND THE ATTACKERS HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT VIRTUALLY SCOT FREE. NOW, MAYBE IT WAS JUST SHEER GOOD LUCK, BUT I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THERE'S ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU1000000136_S0000377	ON THE ISLAND OF ANDOYA, PATRICK IS FOLLOWING A NEW LEAD THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE GERMAN FIGHTERS WEREN'T SCRAMBLED IN TIME.
YOU1000000136_S0000379	HE'S MEETING LOCAL RESIDENT JOURNALIST SANDER PETTUSEN. AS A 17 YEAR OLD BOY, SCHOOLBOY SANDER WORKED IN THE INDOIA RADAR BASE FOR A GERMAN OFFICER, LIEUTENANT KARL HEINRICH WESSNER.
YOU1000000136_S0000381	VESSNER WAS A KEY LINK IN THE RADAR COMMUNICATION NETWORK ON THE ISLAND. PETTERSSON THINKS VESSNER COULD HAVE DELAYED VITAL INFORMATION TO THE FIGHTER SQUADRON AT BAUDOUPHOS.
YOU1000000136_S0000383	WE UNDERSTAND THAT WESSNER HAD SYMPATHY FOR ENGLAND.
YOU1000000136_S0000384	HOW DID HE LET YOU KNOW THAT, THAT HE WAS IN SYMPATHY WITH GERMANY'S ENEMIES?
YOU1000000136_S0000385	YOU SPEAK VERY GOOD.
YOU1000000136_S0000387	THAT'S LIKE A CIGARETTE CASE OR...
YOU1000000136_S0000389	OR INSIDE THE...
YOU1000000136_S0000391	WESSNER WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, BUT WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYING VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RAID?
YOU1000000136_S0000392	I THINK WESTERNERS HAVE A FINGER TO STOP SENDING UP GERMANY PLANES TO TAKE LANCASTER.
YOU1000000136_S0000393	YOU MAY BE RIGHT IN THAT WESSNER, AS YOU SAY, HAD A HAND IN THE AFFAIR.
YOU1000000136_S0000395	TO HELP SUPPORT SANDER PETTERSEN'S STORY, PATRICK HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR MORE EVIDENCE. HE'S UNCOVERED A LETTER IN THE NORWEGIAN ARCHIVES WRITTEN BY VESSNER JUST AFTER THE WAR.
YOU1000000136_S0000397	THIS REALLY CONFIRMS THIS MAN'S ANTI NAZI CREDENTIALS. NOW, ACCORDING TO HIM, HE ACTUALLY WAS ACTIVELY WORKING AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE AS EARLY AS 1944.
YOU1000000136_S0000398	IT'S NOT JUST HIM, HE'S GOT AT LEAST THREE OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO WERE IN THIS CONSPIRACY, IF YOU LIKE, WITH HIM. THE GERMANS HAD A SABOTAGE PLAN WHICH THEY WERE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE IF THERE WAS INDEED AN ALLIED LANDING. AND THEY'VE GOT QUITE AN ELABORATE PLAN HERE FOR SHOOTING THEIR OWN OFFICERS.
YOU1000000136_S0000399	AND RUNNING UP THE WHITE FLAG. HE GOES OVER TO THE UNDERGROUND, THE NORWEGIAN RESISTANCE, AND THEY SMUGGLE HIM OUT. NOW, IF HIS CREDENTIALS WEREN'T PUCKER,
YOU1000000136_S0000400	I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY WOULD DO THAT WILLINGLY. SO HE DOES ACTUALLY MATCH UP TO THE DESCRIPTION THAT WERE GIVEN OF HIM BY SANDRA.
YOU1000000136_S0000402	SO THIS NEW INFORMATION OPENS THE PROSPECT OF AN INTRIGUING NEW THEORY THAT A GOOD GERMAN DID INTERVENE IN A MAJOR OPERATION OF WAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ALLIES AND HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME.
YOU1000000136_S0000404	ON HEARING THE NEWS THAT THE BEAST HAD FINALLY BEEN SLAIN, CHURCHILL WROTE TO STALIN, RAF BOMBERS HAVE SUNK THE TIRPITZ. LET US REJOICE TOGETHER.
YOU1000000136_S0000406	FOR THE YOUNG AIRMEN OF 9 AND 617 SQUADRONS, THERE WAS RELIEF THAT THEY HAD FINALLY FINISHED THE JOB.
YOU1000000136_S0000408	WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WE'D SUNK IT UNTIL WE GOT BACK TO NEAR BASE AND THEY WIRED US. THEY SENT OUT A SIGNAL TO SAY IT HAD BEEN DESTROYED.
YOU1000000136_S0000409	YEAH, IT WAS, IT FELT MARVELLOUS, REALLY. YEAH. I MEAN, IT WAS CALLED, UM, CHURCHILL'S BEAST, WASN'T IT? AND, UH, I KNOW WE SAID TO OURSELVES, WELL, WE'VE SUNK THE BEAST AT LAST.
YOU1000000136_S0000410	IT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED VERY NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO AND I'M JUST GETTING LITTLE FLASHES OF MEMORIES.
YOU1000000136_S0000411	I'M GOING TO GET A LITTLE FLASH OF MEMORY ABOUT THE MESS. BEER FLOWING FREELY, WING COMMANDER IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, DRUNK AS A NEWT.
YOU1000000136_S0000412	AND A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING AND CHATTERING. YES, ABSOLUTE CELEBRATION. WE'D BEEN THREE TIMES FOR THE DAMN THING. WE WERE BEGINNING TO THINK THAT IT REALLY WAS UNSINKABLE.
YOU1000000136_S0000415	FRANK TILLY AND BASIL FISH CELEBRATED THEIR WEEKEND LEAVE WITH A TRIP TO THE LONDON PALLADIUM TO SEE COMEDIAN TOMMY TRINDER.
YOU1000000136_S0000416	I REMEMBER TOMMY TRINDEN MAKING A JOKE ABOUT THE TIRPITZ AND SO WE SAT THERE FEELING QUITE PLEASED WITH OURSELVES, OLD BASIL AND I.
YOU1000000136_S0000418	70 YEARS AGO, KURT SCHULTZ NEARLY SHOT DOWN TONY IVERSON IN THE SKIES OF NORTHERN NORWAY. TODAY, THE FORMER ENEMIES ARE FIRM FRIENDS.
YOU1000000136_S0000420	I DON'T KNOW.
YOU1000000136_S0000421	GOOD MORNING, TONY.
YOU1000000136_S0000422	HELLO.
YOU1000000136_S0000423	I'M SO GLAD I CAN TALK WITH YOU AGAIN JUST ONE WEEK AFTER YOUR 94TH BIRTHDAY. I LIKE KURT. WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER QUITE WELL AND WE HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER ON MY TRIPS THROUGH CALIFORNIA.
YOU1000000136_S0000424	TONY WAS NOT TOO ENTHUSED ABOUT MEETING A DAMN GERMAN PILOT. WE WERE A BIT WARY OF EACH OTHER FOR QUITE A WHILE. BUT THEN...
YOU1000000136_S0000425	WELL, WE HAD A DRINK AND THINGS LOOSENED UP.
YOU1000000136_S0000426	IT WAS A COOL RECEPTION, BUT WE STARTED TALKING AND WE BECAME FRIENDS. WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE WAR. WE TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS THAT WERE INTERESTING TO US.
YOU1000000136_S0000427	TALK WITH YOU AGAIN SOON, TONY.
YOU1000000136_S0000428	RIGHT.
YOU1000000136_S0000429	GOODBYE
YOU1000000136_S0000430	GOODBYE.
YOU1000000136_S0000432	HE SOUNDS NOT TOO STRONG.
YOU1000000136_S0000434	IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE AS HUMAN BEINGS FINALLY COME THROUGH, AFTER THE POLITICIANS DID WITH US WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO DO. AND WE SAID, YES, SIR.
YOU1000000136_S0000436	70 YEARS ON, THE RAID THAT FINALLY SANK THE TIRPITZ IS STILL CONSIDERED ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS OF AERIAL WARFARE.
YOU1000000136_S0000438	I THINK IT WAS VERY WELL PLANNED, VERY WELL EXECUTED. AND TO THROW THOSE BIG BOMBS IN THIS CLOSED CIRCLE AROUND AND ON THE SHIP
YOU1000000136_S0000439	WAS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.
YOU1000000136_S0000441	YEAH.
YOU1000000136_S0000443	BUT SO A THOUSAND GERMANS DIED, SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER TOO.
YOU1000000136_S0000445	CRAZY WAR
YOU1000000136_S0000447	FOR NOTHING.
YOU1000000136_S0000449	IDIOTS OF MY LIFE.
YOU1000000136_S0000451	IT WAS PRETTY TOUGH ONCE, BUT NOW IT'S ALL GONE.
YOU1000000136_S0000453	IT'S RATHER LIKE THE WORDS AT THE CEREMONY, AT THE CENOTAPH, ISN'T IT? YOU KNOW, THEY SHALL NOT GROW OLD. IT STICKS IN YOUR THROAT A BIT.
YOU1000000136_S0000454	I THINK ALL WAR IS DREADFUL, I DO REALLY. I MEAN, IF IT CAME AGAIN, WE'D HAVE TO DO THE SAME AGAIN.
YOU1000000136_S0000456	HE COULDN'T HAVE THE NAZIS IN CHARGE.
YOU1000000136_S0000458	NO WAY.
YOU1000000137_S0000001	ST. PETER'S BASILICA IN THE VATICAN CITY IN ROME. THE CATHEDRAL ON ST. PETER'S SQUARE IS A MAGNIFICENT EDIFICE CAPPED WITH LARGER THAN LIFE STATUES OF THE APOSTLES.
YOU1000000137_S0000003	IT'S THE MOST IMPRESSIVE MONUMENT OF THE RENAISSANCE, WITH COLONNADES REMINISCENT OF THE TEMPLES OF ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000005	ST. PETER'S IS THE LARGEST CHURCH IN THE WORLD. YET ITS CONSTRUCTION WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE JUST A FEW GENERATIONS BEFORE.
YOU1000000137_S0000007	NO ONE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF MATHEMATICS, PHYSICS AND STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING NEEDED TO PLAN AND ORGANIZE SUCH A VAST PROJECT.
YOU1000000137_S0000009	THEN, IN THE MID 16TH CENTURY, ARTISTS AND SCHOLARS STEPPED ONTO THE STAGE AND MANAGED TO DO THINGS THAT HAD SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PREVIOUS THOUSAND YEARS.
YOU1000000137_S0000011	WITHIN JUST FOUR GENERATIONS, THEY ACCRUED THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT MASSIVE PROJECTS SUCH AS ST. PETER'S.
YOU1000000137_S0000013	EUROPE WAS TRANSFORMED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI, MEN OF EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT AND VERSATILITY WHO FOUND WAYS TO BRING SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE IDEAS TO LIFE.
YOU1000000137_S0000015	THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS STILL RESONATE TODAY.
YOU1000000137_S0000017	BUT HOW DID THEY DO IT? WHAT WAS THE SECRET OF AN AGE WHEN THE WORLD SEEMED TO UNDERGO A PARADIGM SHIFT? THE AGE OF THE RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000019	ROME 1547.
YOU1000000137_S0000020	PERHAPS ONE MAN STOOD OUT ABOVE ALL. MICHELANGELO BIONAROTTI, PROJECT MANAGER, ARCHITECT AND ARTIST ON THE CONSTRUCTION SITE FOR ST. PETER'S.
YOU1000000137_S0000022	ALTHOUGH HE WAS IN HIS EARLY 70S BY THIS TIME, HE WAS STILL DRIVEN BY AMBITION.
YOU1000000137_S0000024	MICHELANGELO WAS A PAINTER, SCULPTOR AND ARCHITECT, A SCIENTIST, ICONOCLAST AND A GENIUS. WHAT WE NOW REFER TO AS A RENAISSANCE MAN.
YOU1000000137_S0000026	ONE OF HIS WORKS WOULD BECOME THE ICON OF AN ENTIRE ERA.
YOU1000000137_S0000028	MICHELANGELO'S DAVID IS PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN SCULPTURE IN ART HISTORY.
YOU1000000137_S0000030	MEN LIKE MICHELANGELO WERE THE MANAGERS OF AN ERA IN WHICH ART AND CULTURE, KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AT NEAR LIGHTNING SPEED.
YOU1000000137_S0000032	FLORENCE 1501. MICHELANGELO ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES WITH WORKS THAT SEEMED TO BORDER ON THE MIRACULOUS.
YOU1000000137_S0000033	HE SET OUT TO CARVE DAVID FROM A 12 TON BLOCK OF MARBLE, A FEAT AT WHICH TWO SCULPTORS BEFORE HIM HAD FAILED.
YOU1000000137_S0000035	MICHELANGELO BECAME OBSESSED WITH THE UNDERTAKING AND SPENT THREE YEARS WORKING NON STOP ON THE FIVE METER TALL STATUE, THE FIRST MONUMENTAL SCULPTURE OF THE HIGH RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000037	FROM A CUMBERSOME BLOCK OF MARBLE, MICHELANGELO'S HAMMER AND CHISEL REVEALED A HUMAN FIGURE IN THE POSE OF A GOD.
YOU1000000137_S0000039	THE IMAGE OF MANKIND CHANGED IN THE RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000041	POPE INNOCENT III SAID AT THE END OF THE 12TH CENTURY THAT MAN WAS ROTTENNESS, FORMED OF SLIME AND ASHES, A CONTEMPTIBLE CREATURE. THE MEDIEVAL BELIEF THAT THE SINFUL NATURE OF MAN WAS VISIBLE IN HIS APPEARANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000043	DURING THE RENAISSANCE, WE CAN SEE HOW THIS PESSIMISTIC VIEW HAD BECOME TIRESOME. THE IDEA AROSE THAT MAN WAS ALMOST LIKE GOD. MAN WAS GOD'S CREATION, ENDOWED WITH REASON, WITH STRENGTH, AND CREATED IN HIS IMAGE.
YOU1000000137_S0000044	MAN COULD ALMOST BECOME A GOD.
YOU1000000137_S0000046	SOME TEN YEARS AFTER HE COMPLETED DAVID, MICHELANGELO FINISHED HIS FIGURE OF MOSES FOR THE TOMB OF POPE JULIUS II.
YOU1000000137_S0000048	LARGER THAN LIFE, THIS MOSES IS AN ANGRY PROPHET WITH BULGING VEINS AND A FEARSOME VISAGE, THE WAY GODS WERE DEPICTED IN THE ANCIENT WORLD.
YOU1000000137_S0000050	MICHELANGELO MAY HAVE LEARNED FROM THE MASTERS OF ANTIQUITY, BUT HE DIDN'T COPY THEM.
YOU1000000137_S0000052	THE RENAISSANCE WAS MORE THAN JUST THE REBIRTH OF ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000054	MEN LIKE MICHELANGELO CREATED SOMETHING NEW. THEY TOOK THE TECHNIQUES AND ART OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND ROMANS AND DEVELOPED THEM FURTHER.
YOU1000000137_S0000056	BUT YOU WON'T FIND A SINGLE ARTWORK OF THE RENAISSANCE THAT SIMPLY COPIES AN ANCIENT ONE. THE CRUCIAL THING IS THAT THE RENAISSANCE DIDN'T JUST REDISCOVER THE CRITICAL SPIRIT OF THE GREEKS, FOR EXAMPLE. IT DIDN'T JUST GRAPPLE WITH THE SCIENCE AND SCHOLARSHIP OF ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000057	IT DEVELOPED EVERYTHING FURTHER. IT INVENTED COMPLETELY NEW THINGS AND TOPPLED THE ANCIENT GIANTS WHO HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN ITS TEACHERS.
YOU1000000137_S0000059	BOTTICELLI'S PRIMAVERA, ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN WORKS OF RENAISSANCE ART.
YOU1000000137_S0000061	RAPHAEL'S SCHOOL OF ATHENS GLORIFIED ANCIENT THOUGHT.
YOU1000000137_S0000063	AND LEONARDO DA VINCI'S MONA LISA. FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS, THE SKILL OF REALISTICALLY CAPTURING THE THREE DIMENSIONAL WORLD ON A FLAT CANVAS HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN.
YOU1000000137_S0000064	THE RENAISSANCE REDISCOVERED PERSPECTIVE.
YOU1000000137_S0000066	IT WAS A QUANTUM LEAP FOR ARCHITECTURE, WHICH TOOK ITS INSPIRATION FROM THE SYMMETRY OF THE GREAT BUILDINGS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.
YOU1000000137_S0000068	THE ART OF BUILDING HUGE DOMED STRUCTURES HAD FALLEN INTO OBLIVION IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND WAS REDISCOVERED IN THE RENAISSANCE. BUT THE RENAISSANCE DIDN'T LIMIT ITSELF TO ART.
YOU1000000137_S0000070	THE INVENTION OF DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING ALSO MEANT THAT MEN OF BUSINESS NOW KNEW WHAT FUNDS THEY HAD AVAILABLE. THE SURPLUS FORTUNES OF THE NEWLY WEALTHY FLOWED INTO THE POCKETS OF THE ERA'S ARTISTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000072	IT WAS LIKE AN INVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS. NEVER BEFORE HAD SO MUCH BEEN INVENTED OR DEVISED IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
YOU1000000137_S0000074	NEW MECHANICAL MACHINES WERE CREATED.
YOU1000000137_S0000076	AND THE HUMAN MACHINE WAS RESEARCHED IN INCREASING DETAIL. THE STUDY OF ANATOMY REACHED A PEAK.
YOU1000000137_S0000078	THE FIRST POCKET SIZED TIMEPIECES WERE INVENTED. THIS ALSO MADE IT POSSIBLE TO TRACK THE ORBITS OF PLANETS AND THE MOVEMENTS OF CELESTIAL BODIES. AS THE HEAVENS GUIDED SEAFARERS, ADVENTURERS DISCOVERED NEW TRADE ROUTES.
YOU1000000137_S0000079	THE KNOWN WORLD TRIPLED IN SIZE.
YOU1000000137_S0000081	THERE'S PROBABLY NO PLACE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHERE SO MUCH WAS DISCUSSED IN ONE BIG CONVERSATION INVOLVING SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS, WHERE THINGS WERE INVENTED IN SUCH QUICK SUCCESSION.
YOU1000000137_S0000083	PRINTING TRIGGERED A HUGE DISCOURSE THAT CAPTIVATED LARGE PARTS OF THE POPULATION.
YOU1000000137_S0000085	ELITES, SCHOLARS,
YOU1000000137_S0000087	EXCHANGED IDEAS, AND SO INVENTED GROUNDBREAKING NEW THINGS.
YOU1000000137_S0000089	BUT WHAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THIS EXCEPTIONAL PERIOD OF HISTORY?
YOU1000000137_S0000091	WHAT WERE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS EXPLOSIVE DEVELOPMENT?
YOU1000000137_S0000093	HOW COULD MEN LIKE MICHELANGELO SUDDENLY REACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNIQUES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR CENTURIES?
YOU1000000137_S0000095	LET'S LOOK BACK TO ROME IN THE FIRST CENTURY.
YOU1000000137_S0000097	BACK THEN, THE ROMANS WERE CAPABLE OF CONSTRUCTING BUILDINGS LIKE ST. PETER'S, AS SEEN IN THE ROMAN FORUM, THE POWER CENTER OF AN EMPIRE THAT RULED THE WESTERN WORLD.
YOU1000000137_S0000099	ROME EXPORTED ITS WAY OF LIFE TO ITS FATHER'S PROVINCES. IT DICTATED THE ART, CULTURE AND ARCHITECTURE OF AN ENTIRE ERA.
YOU1000000137_S0000101	AT THE TIME, ROME WAS HOME TO A MILLION PEOPLE, 20 TIMES MORE THAN ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES OF THE RENAISSANCE, LONDON.
YOU1000000137_S0000103	BUT ROME'S DOMINANCE WAS BUILT ON THE OPPRESSION OF MILLIONS OF SLAVES. ENTIRE PEOPLES WERE SUBJUGATED.
YOU1000000137_S0000105	FOR CENTURIES, THE ROMAN MILITARY MACHINE SUCCEEDED IN HOLDING THE EMPIRE TOGETHER.
YOU1000000137_S0000107	BUT AT SOME POINT THE BARBARIANS GAINED THE UPPER HAND, THE GERMANIC TRIBES, THE GOTHS AND THE VANDALS.
YOU1000000137_S0000109	IN THE 5TH CENTURY, THE WESTERN EMPIRE CEASED TO EXIST.
YOU1000000137_S0000111	ROMA CAPUTMUNDI, ONCE THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AND HOME TO A MILLION PEOPLE, FELL INTO DECAY AND THE DARK AGES BEGAN.
YOU1000000137_S0000113	MUCH OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANTIQUITY WAS LOST, IN ALL AREAS, BUT PARTICULARLY IN ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE, MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.
YOU1000000137_S0000115	THE RUINS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD WERE PLUNDERED FOR BUILDING MATERIALS.
YOU1000000137_S0000117	JUST A FEW GENERATIONS AFTER ROME FELL, NO ONE WAS CAPABLE OF CREATING ANYTHING REMOTELY COMPARABLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000119	IN THE YEAR 330, THE ROMAN EMPEROR CONSTANTINE HAD MOVED HIS CAPITAL TO THE BOSPORUS IN WHAT IS NOW TURKEY, NAMING IT CONSTANTINOPLE IN HIS OWN HONOR.
YOU1000000137_S0000121	AFTER THAT, THE EMPIRE SPLIT INTO AN EASTERN AND A WESTERN HALF.
YOU1000000137_S0000123	THE EASTERN ROMAN EMPIRE, ALSO KNOWN AS BYZANTIUM, ENDURED UNTIL THE 15TH CENTURY. CONSTANTINOPLE WAS THE SECOND ROME, HOME TO MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO CALLED THEMSELVES ROMAIOI, ROMANS.
YOU1000000137_S0000125	THE BYZANTINE EMPERORS SAW THEMSELVES AS DESCENDANTS OF CAESAR AND AUGUSTUS, WHILE ITS PATRIARCH WAS HEAD OF THE ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS.
YOU1000000137_S0000127	CONSTANTINOPLE ALSO BECAME THE REPOSITORY OF ANCIENT WISDOM.
YOU1000000137_S0000129	ITS SCHOLARS WERE LEADING FIGURES IN EVERY FIELD.
YOU1000000137_S0000131	THE ROME OF THE EAST WAS THE BULWARK OF ANTIQUITY IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD.
YOU1000000137_S0000133	NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONQUER THE CITY ON THE BOSPORUS.
YOU1000000137_S0000135	BUT ONE SEVENTH OF ITS POPULATION WERE MERCHANTS FROM GENOA, PISA AND THE REPUBLIC OF VENICE, KNOWN AS LATINS.
YOU1000000137_S0000136	THIS AFFLUENT MINORITY HAD A REPUTATION FOR ARROGANCE AND BELLIGERENCE AND WERE UNPOPULAR WITH THE EASTERN ROMANS.
YOU1000000137_S0000138	IN EARLY 1171, RIOTS BROKE OUT IN PERA, THE GENOESE QUARTER.
YOU1000000137_S0000140	THE EMPEROR MANUEL I KOMNENOS ACCUSED THE VENETIANS OF CAUSING THE TROUBLE. VENETIAN MERCHANTS WERE IMPRISONED AND THEIR POSSESSIONS CONFISCATED.
YOU1000000137_S0000142	VENICE TRIED TO DEFEND ITS PEOPLE TO NO AVAIL. IT WAS THE START OF A CONFLICT THAT WAS TO LAST FOR DECADES AND ULTIMATELY END IN DISASTER FOR CONSTANTINOPLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000144	THE CONFLICT CULMINATED IN WHAT HISTORY CALLS THE FOURTH CRUSADE.
YOU1000000137_S0000145	THIS WASN'T A CRUSADE AGAINST PEOPLE OF A DIFFERENT FAITH, BUT A CATHOLIC WAR AGAINST ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS.
YOU1000000137_S0000147	THE CRUSADERS LAID SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND, ON THE NIGHT OF THE 12TH OF APRIL 1204, BROKE THROUGH ITS DEFENCES.
YOU1000000137_S0000149	FOR THREE DAYS THEY PLUNDERED THE CITY, ABUSING, RAPING AND KILLING MANY OF ITS RESIDENTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000151	THE COLLAPSE OF BYZANTIUM, ITS DEFEAT BY THE WEST DURING THE FOURTH CRUSADE, AND ITS SUBJUGATION BY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE ALL PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000153	MANY SCHOLARS FLED TO ITALY, TAKING MANUSCRIPTS WITH THEM AND TRYING TO INSTILL NEW VALUES AND IDEAS INTO A CULTURE THEY STILL SAW AS BARBARIC.
YOU1000000137_S0000154	IT GAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED BOOST TO INNOVATION.
YOU1000000137_S0000156	THE LIBRARIES OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE REPLETE WITH TREASURES OF IMMEASURABLE WORTH. THE COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000158	AS HUNDREDS OF SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS FLED THE ADVANCE OF THE OTTOMAN TURKS, THEY TOOK VALUABLE BOOKS WITH THEM.
YOU1000000137_S0000160	THE SCHOLAR MANUER CHRYSOLOROS WAS ONE OF THEM. WHEN THE CHANCELLOR OF FLORENCE OFFERED HIM A CHAIR AT THE UNIVERSITY THERE, HE ALSO SENT HIM A WISH LIST OF ANCIENT WORKS.
YOU1000000137_S0000162	THIS EXODUS OF SCHOLARS FROM BYZANTIUM REINTRODUCED ANCIENT TECHNIQUES TO THE WEST. MARBLE SCULPTURES TOOK ON A REALISM, MOVEMENT AND VITALITY UNKNOWN IN THE MIDDLE AGES. ANCIENT FRESCOES INSPIRED PAINTERS.
YOU1000000137_S0000164	LONG FORGOTTEN ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES TRIGGERED A WAVE OF TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS.
YOU1000000137_S0000166	ANCIENT IDEAS ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES WERE TAUGHT ONCE MORE.
YOU1000000137_S0000168	SCIENCE, ESPECIALLY MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS, EXPERIENCED AN UNEXPECTED REVIVAL AFTER CENTURIES OF OBLIVION.
YOU1000000137_S0000170	THE EUROPEANS LEARNED FROM SEVERAL CIVILIZATIONS. THEY LEARNED FROM THE GREEKS AND ROMANS, THE ARABS, THE BYZANTINES, AND ALSO FROM THE INDIANS. THE ARABIC NUMERAL SYSTEM WE USE TODAY ACTUALLY CAME FROM INDIA.
YOU1000000137_S0000174	BUT THEY DIDN'T JUST COPY. THEY DEVELOPED SOMETHING NEW WITH WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED AND DISSEMINATED THESE IDEAS THROUGH PRINTING.
YOU1000000137_S0000176	THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLE FLOURISHING OF DISCUSSION AND DEBATE.
YOU1000000137_S0000178	FLORENCE IN 1410, A CITY STATE WITH A POPULATION OF 50,000, THE SIZE OF LONDON, AND BURSTING WITH SELF CONFIDENCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000180	THE ITALIAN CITY WAS LIKE THE SILICON VALLEY OF THE RENAISSANCE, A FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE AND A MEETING PLACE FOR ARTISTS AND SCHOLARS.
YOU1000000137_S0000182	THE AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR THE CATHEDRAL OF MARIA DEL FIORE WERE DRAWN UP AROUND 1300.
YOU1000000137_S0000183	IT WAS TO BE THE LARGEST CHURCH IN CHRISTENDOM, BIGGER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE CATHEDRALS OF PISA, SIENA AND MILAN.
YOU1000000137_S0000185	153 METERS LONG, FLORENCE CATHEDRAL REMAINS THE FOURTH LARGEST CHURCH IN THE WORLD. BUT BACK THEN, IT WAS NUMBER ONE.
YOU1000000137_S0000187	BY THE TIME ITS 45 METER DIAMETER DOME WAS COMPLETED, IT SET A WORLD RECORD.
YOU1000000137_S0000188	GIORGIO VASARI, AN ARTIST AND ARCHITECT, BEGAN WORK ON THE 4,000 SQUARE METER FRESCO IN ITS INTERIOR, WHICH WAS TO RIVAL MICHELANGELO'S LAST JUDGMENT.
YOU1000000137_S0000190	BUT VASARI'S FIGURES ARE LOST IN THE HEIGHT OF THE DOME. VISITORS BELOW CAN BARELY SEE THEM.
YOU1000000137_S0000192	IN 1418, MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER ITS CONSTRUCTION BEGAN, THE CATHEDRAL DOME HAD NOT BEEN BUILT.
YOU1000000137_S0000194	NO ONE IN THE MIDDLE AGES HAD THE KNOWLEDGE TO SOLVE THE STRUCTURAL AND TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI TOOK ON THE TASK.
YOU1000000137_S0000196	BRUNELLESCHI WAS AN ARCHITECT AND SCULPTOR, AS WELL AS AN ENGINEER AND AN INVENTOR.
YOU1000000137_S0000198	INSPIRED BY THE ANCIENT DOMES OF THE PANTHEON AND THE HAGIA SOPHIA, HE HAD CLEAR IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO REALIZE THE AMBITIOUS PROJECT.
YOU1000000137_S0000200	HE DEVELOPED SPECIAL CRANES FOR THE DOME'S CONSTRUCTION, NEW INVENTIONS THAT WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE BUILDING METHODS.
YOU1000000137_S0000202	BRUNELLESCHI'S MACHINES WERE A NOVELTY OF HIS ERA AND WERE WIDELY ADMIRED.
YOU1000000137_S0000204	THE CABLE THAT LIFTED THE BLOCKS OF STONE WAS 7 CENTIMETERS THICK, 180 METERS LONG, AND WEIGHED HALF A TON.
YOU1000000137_S0000206	YEARS LATER, THE BUILDER WOULD RECEIVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO BUILD A SHIP WITH A CRANE ON IT, THE FIRST PATENT IN INDUSTRIAL HISTORY. FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI REDISCOVERED PERSPECTIVE, A TECHNIQUE LARGELY FORGOTTEN SINCE ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000208	IT WAS A GEOMETRICAL SYSTEM THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DEPICT THREE DIMENSIONAL VIEWS REALISTICALLY.
YOU1000000137_S0000209	USING IT, HE MANAGED TO PUT THE BUILDING PLANS DOWN ON PAPER AND RENDER THEM VISUALLY COMPREHENSIBLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000211	IT WAS THE DAWN OF MODERN ARCHITECTURE.
YOU1000000137_S0000213	PERSPECTIVE DRAWING ALSO INSPIRED PAINTERS AND THEIR WORKS TOOK ON A NEW REALISM.
YOU1000000137_S0000215	ARTISTS TOOK VIEWERS ON A JOURNEY TO NEW WORLDS, AND RENAISSANCE PAINTINGS BECAME MORE REALISTIC THAN EVER BEFORE.
YOU1000000137_S0000217	THE REDISCOVERY OF PERSPECTIVE DRAWING WAS A POWERFUL ENGINE OF PROGRESS.
YOU1000000137_S0000219	THE FASHIONABLE ARCHITECTS IN ITALY'S COMPETING CITY STATES, PARTICULARLY IN VENICE, MILAN, FLORENCE AND PISA, BECAME SOME OF THE TOP EARNERS OF THE RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000221	NO LONGER NAMELESS AS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE MIDDLE AGES, THEY WERE CELEBRATED AND PAMPERED ELITES.
YOU1000000137_S0000223	VENETIAN NOBLEMEN SPENT FORTUNES ON PALACES IN THE NEO STYLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000225	SWISS ARCHITECT ANTONIO CONTINO DESIGNED AND BUILT THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS, ONE OF THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED MOTIFS IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000137_S0000227	THIS NEW STYLE OF BUILDING BECAME POPULAR OUTSIDE ITALY.
YOU1000000137_S0000228	THE CITY HALL IN ZURICH IS A MASTERPIECE OF THE LATE RENAISSANCE. A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER, THE SCULPTOR AND BUILDER ANTON EISENMANN HAD BUILT ONE OF THE MOST PICTURESQUE EXAMPLES OF ITALIAN RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000229	THE LUCERNE TOWN HALL IN SWITZERLAND.
YOU1000000137_S0000231	THE NEW STYLE, INSPIRED BY THE BUILDINGS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD, WAS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMMETRY AND A CLEAR SYSTEM FOR THE ARRANGEMENT OF COLUMNS, ARCHES AND DOMES.
YOU1000000137_S0000233	ARCHITECTURE, GARDENS AND SCULPTURES WERE DESIGNED AS COMPLETE ARTISTIC ENSEMBLES. THE AIM WAS TO PLEASE THE EYE AND PLEASE THE PEOPLE, NOT PRAISE GOD.
YOU1000000137_S0000235	MEDIEVAL ART WAS BASICALLY RELIGIOUS ART.
YOU1000000137_S0000237	THAT'S IN PART EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT WE ONLY KNOW THE NAMES OF A HANDFUL OF THE ARTISTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000239	ALTHOUGH IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO SIGN INDIVIDUAL WORKS, WE OFTEN SPEAK OF THE MASTER OF SUCH AND SUCH, WHOSE NAME WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. IN THE RENAISSANCE, WE SEE THE CREATORS OF WORKS BEING NAMED.
YOU1000000137_S0000241	ART BECAME FREE FROM RELIGIOUS MOTIFS AND TURNED TOWARDS EVERYDAY LIFE.
YOU1000000137_S0000243	IT ALSO DESCRIBED THAT EVERYDAY LIFE MORE ACCURATELY. THINK OF PERSPECTIVE PAINTING, FOR EXAMPLE. ART TRIED TO REFLECT EVERYDAY LIFE IN GREAT DETAIL. EXTREMELY SELF CONFIDENT ARTISTS STEPPED UP.
YOU1000000137_S0000244	AND MADE THEIR DEMANDS, CONFRONTING THE POWERFUL WHO IN TURN THEN COURTED THEM.
YOU1000000137_S0000246	MICHELANGELO, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO WOULD EVEN DICTATE CERTAIN THINGS TO THE POPE.
YOU1000000137_S0000248	IN 1347, THE BLACK DEATH BROKE OUT IN EUROPE.
YOU1000000137_S0000250	BUBONIC PLAGUE KILLED ALMOST HALF THE ENGLISH POPULATION WITHIN JUST SEVEN MONTHS, AND AT LEAST A THIRD OF THE POPULATION OF EUROPE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
YOU1000000137_S0000252	MILLIONS PERISHED.
YOU1000000137_S0000254	IT WAS THE MOST HORRIFIC EPIDEMIC IN EUROPEAN HISTORY, AND IT CHANGED EVERYTHING, ULTIMATELY EVEN PEOPLE THEMSELVES.
YOU1000000137_S0000256	IT MIGHT SOUND CYNICAL, BUT THE PLAGUE DIDN'T JUST HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE CULTURE OF THE RENAISSANCE AND THE ARTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000258	THE WEALTH OF THE DEAD WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF THE SURVIVORS.
YOU1000000137_S0000260	AND THOSE WHO SURVIVED SAW LIFE WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EYES.
YOU1000000137_S0000262	SOME MUST HAVE SAID, LET'S ENJOY OUR DAYS AND SPEND THEM IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000264	MAYBE THEY WANTED TO SURROUND THEMSELVES WITH BEAUTIFUL ART.
YOU1000000137_S0000266	OTHERS WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SQUARE THEIR ACCOUNTS WITH GOD AND DO SOMETHING FOR THE WELL BEING OF THEIR SOULS, LIKE COSIMO DI MEDICI, WHO BUILT AN ENTIRE CHURCH.
YOU1000000137_S0000268	THE PLAGUE HAD A FUNDAMENTAL INFLUENCE ON PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE TO LIFE.
YOU1000000137_S0000270	THE IMPERATIVE OF THE RENAISSANCE WAS, LIVE THIS LIFE AND ENJOY IT.
YOU1000000137_S0000271	RENAISSANCE ART WAS A COMPLETE DEPARTURE FROM THE ART OF THE MIDDLE AGES. NUDE BODIES EVERYWHERE, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE ENMESHED IN IDYLLIC LANDSCAPES, OPEN EROTICISM.
YOU1000000137_S0000273	IN MICHELANGELO'S LAST JUDGMENT, THE HEAVENLY HOST IS SHOWN NUDE IN GREAT ANATOMICAL DETAIL. IT WAS A REVOLUTION.
YOU1000000137_S0000275	THE PLAGUE RAVAGED FLORENCE. ONLY A FIFTH OF THE CITY'S POPULATION SURVIVED THE BLACK DEATH.
YOU1000000137_S0000277	IT ALSO CHANGED HOW WEALTH WAS DISTRIBUTED AND LED TO THE RISE OF A NEW ELITE, TYCOONS WHO BECAME UNIMAGINABLY RICH.
YOU1000000137_S0000279	FAMILIES LIKE THE MEDICI WERE MERCHANTS AND BANKERS, PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN CONTEMPT BY THE FEUDAL SOCIETY OF THE MIDDLE AGES. NOW, THEY WERE THE ONES IN CHARGE.
YOU1000000137_S0000281	LET'S GO BACK TO THE YEAR 1425 AND THE SCULPTOR DONATELLO.
YOU1000000137_S0000283	HIS PATRON COSIMO MEDICI WAS THE FIRST GREAT SPONSOR OF THE ARTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000284	MEDICI WAS A WEALTHY BANKER AND A SHREWD STRATEGIST WHO EMPLOYED ALMOST MAFIA LIKE METHODS.
YOU1000000137_S0000286	HE WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN OF HIS DAY AND HIS MONEY FUELED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE IN FLORENCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000288	IT PROVIDED THE SPARK THAT IGNITED THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000290	BUT HIS SUCCESS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT A SEEMINGLY MINOR INVENTION THAT REVOLUTIONIZED BANKING.
YOU1000000137_S0000292	DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING WAS A SIMPLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT INVOLVED KEEPING A CREDIT ACCOUNT SHOWING INCOME AND A DEBIT ACCOUNT WITH OUTGOING PAYMENTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000293	THE FIRST COMPLETE DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM CAN BE TRACED BACK TO 1340, IN LEDGERS FROM GENOA SHOWING GOVERNMENT INCOME AND EXPENDITURE.
YOU1000000137_S0000295	DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKKEEPING SHOWED ACCOUNT HOLDERS HOW MUCH CAPITAL THEY HAD ON HAND, ALLOWING THEM GREATER OVERVIEW AND CONTROL OF THEIR FINANCES.
YOU1000000137_S0000297	THE MEDICIS WERE GLOBAL PLAYERS. THEY ISSUED LOANS AND SIGNED SECURE CREDIT NOTES FOR TRAVELERS THAT COULD BE CASHED IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE PRECURSOR TO TODAY'S TRAVELERS' CHECKS.
YOU1000000137_S0000302	ON TAXES, DONATIONS TO THE NEEDY, ON BUILDINGS AND ON ART.
YOU1000000137_S0000304	A HOST OF WRITERS, SCHOLARS, ARTISTS AND ARCHITECTS WERE DEPENDENT ON HIS MONEY. AND THEY REPAID HIM IN BEAUTY.
YOU1000000137_S0000306	THE MEDICI PALACE IS A GLORIOUS STAGE OF RENAISSANCE ART. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT COSIMO INSTRUCTED THE ARCHITECT NOT TO MAKE IT TOO MAGNIFICENT, AS HE DIDN'T WANT TO ROUSE THE ENVY OF THE OTHER PATRICIAN FAMILIES.
YOU1000000137_S0000308	THE MEDICIS ALSO INVESTED IN THEIR SPIRITUAL WELL BEING. THEY DONATED MONEY FOR A NEW CHURCH, THE BASILICA DI SAN LORENZO.
YOU1000000137_S0000310	COSIMO DE' MEDICI SUPPORTED ARTISTS' CAREERS AND SPAWNED SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT EXISTED BEFORE, THE CELEBRITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000312	THIS CELEBRITY AROSE IN A SORT OF INTELLECTUAL HOTHOUSE, IN A MARKET FULL OF COMPETITION, WHERE HUMANISTS, INTELLECTUALS, CREATIVES AND ARTISTS OF ALL KINDS WERE SUPPORTED, AND OFTEN VERY WELL PAID, BY PATRONS.
YOU1000000137_S0000314	THESE PATRONS, IN TURN, HOPED THESE ARTISTS WOULD BRING THEIR COURTS GREATER FAME AND STATUS.
YOU1000000137_S0000316	FOR PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS, HYPERBOLE SOON BECAME JUST AS IMPORTANT AS SKILL.
YOU1000000137_S0000318	IN THIS VERY COMPETITIVE ARENA, THEY ACQUIRED FAME AND STATUS. AND WE STILL KNOW THEIR NAMES TODAY.
YOU1000000137_S0000320	BUT THAT ALSO MEANS THE UNRECOGNIZED ARTIST, THE SUFFERING GENIUS, WAS A PARTICULARLY FREQUENT PHENOMENON.
YOU1000000137_S0000322	DONATELLO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GREAT CELEBRITY ARTISTS OF THE RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000324	HE WAS ALMOST 60 WHEN HE CAME TO COSIMO DE' MEDICI WITH DESIGNS FOR HIS STATUE OF DAVID, THE BOY WHO DEFEATED GOLIATH.
YOU1000000137_S0000326	THIS, HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT WORK, WAS ALSO A BRAVE ONE, BECAUSE DONATELLO'S DAVID WAS NAKED.
YOU1000000137_S0000328	JUST A FEW GENERATIONS EARLIER, ANCIENT STATUES WERE DESTROYED FOR SHOWING NUDITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000330	BOTH MEDICI AND DONATELLO WERE CERTAINLY AWARE OF HOW REVOLUTIONARY IT WAS.
YOU1000000137_S0000331	DONATELLO'S DAVID WAS THE FIRST LIFE SIZED SCULPTURE OF A NUDE SINCE ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000333	UNLIKE OTHER CULTURES, THE RENAISSANCE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT DEPICTING NAKED OR SEMI NAKED BODIES. THAT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINE.
YOU1000000137_S0000335	YOU CAN'T STUDY ANATOMY IF YOU CAN'T DEPICT NAKED BODIES.
YOU1000000137_S0000337	THAT WAS CRUCIAL TO A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT PEOPLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000339	A PERSON WASN'T JUST ANIMATED BY THE SPIRITS AND GUIDED BY THE STARS.
YOU1000000137_S0000341	HE WAS A MECHANICALLY FUNCTIONING MACHINE, AN ORGANISM.
YOU1000000137_S0000343	WHAT WAS ALSO UNUSUAL WAS HIS INTERPRETATION.
YOU1000000137_S0000345	DONATELLO'S DAVID IS NOT A MUSCULAR ADULT, BUT A YOUTH WITH A RATHER FEMININE APPEARANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000347	AND HE IS FASCINATINGLY LIFELIKE. BUT WHERE DID DONATELLO GET HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN BODY?
YOU1000000137_S0000349	WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE EARLY RENAISSANCE FOR ALL THINGS CLASSICAL, INTEREST IN ANATOMY WAS GROWING AS WELL.
YOU1000000137_S0000351	ALMOST ALL THE ARTISTS, SCULPTORS AND PAINTERS OF THE RENAISSANCE WOULD HAVE STUDIED HUMAN ANATOMY, IF ONLY FROM BOOKS AND DRAWINGS.
YOU1000000137_S0000353	THERE WAS A FLOURISHING TRADE IN FRESH CORPSES. IT WAS ILLEGAL IN MANY PLACES AND PUNISHMENT FOR THIS CRIME WAS OFTEN DRACONIAN, BUT CURIOSITY OFTEN TRIUMPHED OVER FEAR.
YOU1000000137_S0000355	DI NATALE QUITE POSSIBLY DISSECTED CORPSES TOO, AS DID ALBRECHT DÜRER, MICHELANGELO AND LEONARDO DA VINCI ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS LATER.
YOU1000000137_S0000357	BUT EVEN IN DONATELLO'S TIME, IN THE EARLY RENAISSANCE, ARTISTS WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BODY, WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE NEW, VERY LIFELIKE DEPICTIONS OF PEOPLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000359	MEN LIKE DONATELLO WERE EITHER ARTISTICALLY TALENTED SCHOLARS OR SCHOLARLY ARTISTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000361	AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT, DONATELLO'S INTERPRETATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT HERO DIDN'T ACHIEVE THE SAME POPULARITY AS ANOTHER SCULPTURE OF THE RENAISSANCE, ONE THAT WAS ALSO CREATED IN FLORENCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000363	AT FIVE METERS TALL, MICHELANGELO'S DAVID IS A MONUMENTAL STATUE.
YOU1000000137_S0000365	HALF A CENTURY AFTER DONATELLO, IT SYMBOLIZED THE SELF CONFIDENCE OF THE NEW RENAISSANCE MAN.
YOU1000000137_S0000369	THE EXPLOSIVE THING ABOUT THE RENAISSANCE WAS THAT PEOPLE BECAME AWARE OF THEIR ABILITIES AND STRENGTHS IN A NEW WAY.
YOU1000000137_S0000371	THEY UNLEASHED AN INCREDIBLE ENERGY IN THEIR THINKING AND ACTIONS, IN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY.
YOU1000000137_S0000373	THERE WAS AN OUTPOURING OF SELF CONFIDENCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000375	IN THE MIDDLE AGES, NEARLY EVERYONE WAS ILLITERATE. THE FEW WHO COULD READ AND WRITE WERE FROM WEALTHIER FAMILIES OR MEN AND WOMEN OF THE CHURCH.
YOU1000000137_S0000377	THE PEOPLE WHO MADE OR OWNED BOOKS LOOKED AFTER THEM LIKE TREASURES.
YOU1000000137_S0000379	A COPYIST MIGHT ONLY PRODUCE 10 TO 15 VOLUMES IN AN ENTIRE LIFETIME, WHICH MADE THE BOOKS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000381	BUT THAT WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE.
YOU1000000137_S0000383	TO OBTAIN A LOVELY CODEX SUCH AS A BIBLE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WOULD HAVE TO SLAUGHTER AN ENTIRE FLOCK OF SHEEP. AND THAT WAS EXPENSIVE.
YOU1000000137_S0000385	BUT SUDDENLY BOOKS COULD BE HAD FOR LITTLE MONEY, AND READING BECAME DEMOCRATIC.
YOU1000000137_S0000387	KNOWLEDGE BECAME ACCESSIBLE TO LARGER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000389	MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOLARLY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NEW IDEAS.
YOU1000000137_S0000391	THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXPLAIN HOW EUROPE BECAME THE CONTINENT OF INNOVATION, MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER.
YOU1000000137_S0000393	THE SCRIBES OF THE CHURCH HADN'T JUST COPIED WORKS, THEY HAD ALSO CHANGED THEM AND FALSIFIED SOURCES, CLAIMING THEIR INTERPRETATION AS THE WORD OF GOD.
YOU1000000137_S0000395	THAT GAVE THEM GREAT POWER.
YOU1000000137_S0000397	BUT THE RENAISSANCE BROKE THEIR MONOPOLY ON KNOWLEDGE, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BASTIONS OF THE CHURCH.
YOU1000000137_S0000399	AN AWARENESS OF SOURCES AND THE TRUTH GREW, NOT LEAST BECAUSE THESE SOURCES WERE NOW ACCESSIBLE. PEOPLE STARTED ANALYZING THEM USING CLASSICAL TECHNIQUES, TECHNIQUES USED IN ANTIQUITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000401	THE TRADITIONAL MYTHS PROPAGATED BY THE CHURCH SIMPLY WEREN'T ACCEPTED ANYMORE.
YOU1000000137_S0000403	MAINZ 1450. PRINTER JOHANNES GUTENBERG'S INVENTION MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE IN A THOUSAND YEARS. AND YET WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.
YOU1000000137_S0000405	HIS ACHIEVEMENT WAS TO COMBINE EXISTING METHODS OF REPRODUCTION AND PRINTING INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM.
YOU1000000137_S0000407	THE HANDHELD CAST WAS THE KEY TO HIS PRINTING PRESS.
YOU1000000137_S0000409	IT ALLOWED LETTERS TO BE CAST INDIVIDUALLY MORE QUICKLY AND WITH GREATER PRECISION.
YOU1000000137_S0000411	THIS MARKED THE INVENTION OF MODERN PRINTING.
YOU1000000137_S0000413	IT WAS ALSO THE DAWN OF MASS COMMUNICATION.
YOU1000000137_S0000415	INFORMATION BECAME MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE, OPENING THE DOOR TO NEW OPINIONS AND PERSPECTIVES.
YOU1000000137_S0000417	INFORMATION ALSO BECAME VALUED IN NEW WAYS, AS THE PRINTED WORD TOOK PRECEDENCE OVER ORAL TRADITIONS.
YOU1000000137_S0000419	PRINTING WAS OF TRULY ENORMOUS SIGNIFICANCE, AND GUTENBERG IS THE PERSON WHO DID THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN A THOUSAND YEARS OF WORLD HISTORY. READING BECAME INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD.
YOU1000000137_S0000420	THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC INNOVATIONS AND THE GREAT RELIGIOUS REVOLUTION, THE REFORMATION, WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT PRINTING.
YOU1000000137_S0000422	THE FIRST 60 YEARS AFTER THE INVENTION OF PRINTING SAW THE PUBLICATION OF 400 DIFFERENT VERNACULAR EDITIONS OF THE BIBLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000424	AT THE SAME TIME, THE NUMBER OF LAY PEOPLE WHO COULD READ AND WRITE GREW.
YOU1000000137_S0000426	MORE AND MORE PEOPLE NOW HAD DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO BIBLICAL TEXTS, TO THE WORD OF GOD.
YOU1000000137_S0000429	THE PEOPLE OF THE RENAISSANCE FELT CLOSE TO GOD. THEY FELT THEY WERE BECOMING GOD LIKE THEMSELVES. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT IN THE MIDDLE AGES. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BLASPHEMOUS. PEOPLE REFERRED TO THE BIBLE AND CALLED THEMSELVES GOD'S CREATIONS.
YOU1000000137_S0000430	GOD MADE US IN HIS IMAGE. WE'RE ALMOST GODS IN MINIATURE. GOD CAME CLOSER TO PEOPLE IN THE RENAISSANCE THAN HE EVER WAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES.
YOU1000000137_S0000432	BUT IT WASN'T BOOKS THAT MADE UP THE BULK OF THE PRINTING SHOP'S BUSINESS. IT WAS FLYSHEETS AND PAMPHLETS.
YOU1000000137_S0000434	THEY WERE AFFORDABLE AND COST A LABOURER TWO OR THREE HOURS' PAY.
YOU1000000137_S0000436	NOW EVEN ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD PRINT A PAMPHLET AND DISSEMINATE THEIR OPINIONS, VERSES, AND DRAWINGS.
YOU1000000137_S0000438	THREE SUBJECTS DOMINATED, SENSATIONS AND MIRACLES, RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION, AND POLITICAL AND MILITARY PROPAGANDA.
YOU1000000137_S0000440	ILLUSTRATED FLYSHEETS ALSO CARRIED THE FIRST CARICATURES.
YOU1000000137_S0000442	THEY COULD BE AN INVITATION, AN OPINION, OR A WARNING.
YOU1000000137_S0000444	JUST LIKE TODAY'S SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS, THEY SERVED AS A VEHICLE FOR THE MASS DISSEMINATION OF OPINION.
YOU1000000137_S0000446	THE RENAISSANCE HAD FLY SHEETS. IT HAD LITERATURE THAT WAS PRINTED AND SPREAD VERY QUICKLY. IT COULD BE PRINTED IN NUREMBERG TOMORROW AND IN TWO DAYS' TIME WOULD BE IN ZURICH."
YOU1000000137_S0000448	INFORMATION DISSEMINATED MORE QUICKLY AND WAS MUCH HARDER TO CONTROL, TOO.
YOU1000000137_S0000450	THE CENSORSHIP OF THE CHURCH THAT DICTATED WHAT WAS RIGHT DIDN'T WORK ANYMORE ONCE THE FLYSHEETS BEGAN CIRCULATING.
YOU1000000137_S0000452	YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THE HUGE BOOM IN FREE THINKING IN THE RENAISSANCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEDIA, AND THE FLYSHEETS IN PARTICULAR.
YOU1000000137_S0000454	MASS COMMUNICATION HELPED CREATE THAT NEW TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL, THE CELEBRITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000456	GIORGIO VASARI, WHO HAD PAINTED THE FRESCOES IN THE FLORENCE CATHEDRAL DOME, WAS ALSO A BIOGRAPHER OF THE MOST DAZZLING PERSONALITIES OF HIS TIME, THE ARTISTS.
YOU1000000137_S0000458	VASARI ALSO PRODUCED PORTRAITS OF RAPHAEL AND MICHELANGELO, BUT HE WAS PARTICULARLY TAKEN WITH LEONARDO DA VINCI. LEONARDO WAS UNCONVENTIONAL AND WASN'T AFRAID TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HOMOSEXUALITY.
YOU1000000137_S0000460	HE WAS REMARKABLY CREATIVE AND TALENTED, BUT ALSO RATHER VAIN.
YOU1000000137_S0000462	VASARI WAS THE FIRST TO COIN THE TERM, RENESHETA, RENAISSANCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000464	HE ENDOWED HIS SUBJECTS WITH THE AURA THAT MADE THEM STARS, THE SHINING LIGHTS OF SOCIETY.
YOU1000000137_S0000466	HE CREATED AN IMAGE OF THE ARTIST THAT HADN'T EXISTED BEFORE.
YOU1000000137_S0000468	MOST ARTISTS WERE CRAFTSMEN.
YOU1000000137_S0000470	THAT'S HOW THEY SAW THEMSELVES, AND THAT'S HOW OTHERS SAW THEM. BUT VASARI CREATED THE IMAGE OF THE GENIUS, THE STRANGE, CRAZY MAN, THE ARTIST ENTHRALLED TO IDEAS.
YOU1000000137_S0000471	HE PAINTED A PICTURE OF AN ARTIST THAT SEEMS STRANGELY FAMILIAR TODAY. IN FACT, HE CREATED THE MODERN ARTIST.
YOU1000000137_S0000473	THE PAINTER HOLBEIN WAS THE FIRST TO PAINT A PORTRAIT OF HIS FAMILY.
YOU1000000137_S0000475	STAR PAINTERS BOTTICELLI AND DURER EVEN PAINTED THEMSELVES. THE SELF PORTRAIT BECAME THE EXPRESSION OF A NEW SELF CONFIDENCE.
YOU1000000137_S0000477	AND THEN FINALLY, RAPHAEL AND TITIAN, THE FIRST PAINTERS TO SIGN THEIR PAINTINGS, A FURTHER STEP TOWARDS CELEBRITY. THE GREAT NAMES IN ART SUDDENLY BECAME WORLD FAMOUS. A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE.
YOU1000000137_S0000479	THE TOWERING FIGURES OF RENAISSANCE ART, FIRST AND FOREMOST LEONARDO DA VINCI AND MICHELANGELO, WERE FETED, INVITED TO COURT, AND PAID HANDSOMELY.
YOU1000000137_S0000481	IN 1300, VENETIAN GLASSBLOWERS INVENTED THE CONVEX MIRROR. ITS IMPORTANCE IS WIDELY UNDERESTIMATED, BUT COMPARED WITH WHAT HAD COME BEFORE, ITS REFLECTION WAS BRIGHT AND ALMOST FREE OF DISTORTION.
YOU1000000137_S0000483	MOST PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES HAD ONLY SEEN THEIR FACES AS BLURRY REFLECTIONS IN WATER.
YOU1000000137_S0000485	THE GLASS MIRROR MEANT PEOPLE COULD REALLY SEE THEMSELVES CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST TIME.
YOU1000000137_S0000487	MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY WERE MORE SELF CONFIDENT THAN THEIR MEDIEVAL ANCESTORS.
YOU1000000137_S0000489	SELF CONFIDENCE AND PRIDE IN PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS WERE NO LONGER SEEN AS SINFUL.
YOU1000000137_S0000491	HUMILITY WAS OUT OF STEP WITH THE TIMES.
YOU1000000137_S0000493	A PERSON WHO HELD HIS HEAD HIGH AND WALKED TALL IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, WHO SAW REASON AS HIS SPECIAL GIFT FROM GOD. THOSE WERE THE NEW VALUES.
YOU1000000137_S0000495	AS A RESULT, HUMILITY BECAME LESS IMPORTANT. AS HUMANS, WE'RE CAPABLE, AND GOD WANTS US TO USE OUR GIFTS IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000137_S0000497	WHAT WAS THE SECRET OF THE GREAT RENAISSANCE ARTISTS? THIS IMMENSE FLOURISHING OF CREATIVITY REMAINS A MYSTERY, BUT THEIR CHARISMA ENDURES TO THIS DAY.
YOU1000000138_S0000001	LAST YEAR WAS THE DEADLIEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR MEXICO.
YOU1000000138_S0000003	DRUG RELATED VIOLENCE HAS INFILTRATED ALL PARTS OF SOCIETY AND ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. IT'S AFFECTING EVERYONE AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE.
YOU1000000138_S0000005	ACAPULCO WAS SOMEWHERE AT THE CENTER OF SOME OF THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.
YOU1000000138_S0000007	OUR STORY WAS THE INFLUENCE OF THE CRIME GANGS, HOW THEIR TENTACLES HAVE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND ACAPULCO IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT. SO WE ASKED THE POLICE IF WE CAN GO ALONG ON A POLICE PATROL.
YOU1000000138_S0000009	WELL, THE CIA'S LATEST TRAVEL ADVISORIES FOR A NUMBER OF AREAS IN MEXICO, BUT PARTICULARLY HERE, IS DON'T EVEN BOTHER GOING IF YOU'RE A TOURIST. THE REASON FOR THAT, THEY SAY, IS THAT THE MURDER RATE, THE DANGER LEVELS ARE SO HIGH, THEY'RE ACTUALLY COMPARABLE TO IRAQ.
YOU1000000138_S0000010	AND SYRIA. INDEED, HERE IN ONE MONTH LAST YEAR, OVER 2,000 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED IN THESE DRUG WARS.
YOU1000000138_S0000012	ON THIS PATROL WE ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE, A SMALL TOWN, AND IT WAS A
YOU1000000138_S0000014	BIZARRE EXPERIENCE.
YOU1000000138_S0000016	WE CAME ACROSS A CRIME SCENE WHERE LESS THAN 24 HOURS PREVIOUSLY, EIGHT PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED.
YOU1000000138_S0000018	OKAY, SO THIS IS
YOU1000000138_S0000020	SO THIS IS WHERE SOMEBODY'S BEEN KILLED, RIGHT?
YOU1000000138_S0000022	SO ONE PERSON HERE.
YOU1000000138_S0000024	ANOTHER ONE HERE.
YOU1000000138_S0000026	THERE WAS STILL BULLET HOLES EVERYWHERE, THERE WAS BLOOD SPLATTERS ON THE FLOOR. ANOTHER HERE, ANOTHER THERE. THERE WAS ALL THESE LITTLE FLOWERS AND CANDLES THAT HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE SPOTS WHERE PEOPLE HAD DIED ONLY JUST RECENTLY.
YOU1000000138_S0000027	THE LAST OF THE CRIME SCENES IS HERE, AND YOU CAN SEE THE BULLET HOLES FROM THE SHOOTING TAKE PLACE HERE. THAT'S EIGHT IN TOTAL. SO THIS IS A PRETTY BIG AND ORGANIZED HIT.
YOU1000000138_S0000029	THEY ACTUALLY WENT FROM PERSON TO PERSON. I MEAN, THESE WERE ACTUAL SHOOTING INDIVIDUALS. SO NOT JUST THIS, BUT ACTUALLY... SO THEY WERE HIDING.
YOU1000000138_S0000031	IT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR WIVES, THEIR MUMS, THEIR SISTERS, REALLY TRAUMATISED. IT WAS VERY, VERY SAD.
YOU1000000138_S0000033	THERE WAS A LOT OF GRIEF AND THAT PEOPLE WERE UPSET BY WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND THEY WANTED JUSTICE.
YOU1000000138_S0000035	THEY SAID THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME, THIS IS MY SECOND, THIS IS MY THIRD KID, THEY KILLED ALL MY FAMILY. IT'S JUST LIKE A, IT'S A CONFLICT ZONE. IT'S REALLY BAD. YOU FEEL...
YOU1000000138_S0000037	I FEEL REALLY, REALLY SAD WHEN WE LEFT.
YOU1000000138_S0000039	IT'S A LEVEL OF BRUTALITY AND TRAGEDY THAT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND WHEN YOU COME FROM A SOCIETY LIKE I LIVE IN.
YOU1000000138_S0000041	SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING SORRY ON HACK ME OR IT'S GONNA BE IN THE NEWSPAPERS ALL OVER THE UK AND HERE IS JUST A
YOU1000000138_S0000043	SOMETHING LITTLE, NEXT DAY NO ONE WILL REMEMBER.
YOU1000000138_S0000045	WE THEN DECIDED TO TRY AND GET TO ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE STUFF THAT FUELS ALL OF THE PROBLEMS.
YOU1000000138_S0000047	WE WERE TAKEN UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO A MODEST HOUSE WITH A BIG FRONT PORCH. AND THERE WE WERE INTRODUCED TO A GUY WHO IS CLEARLY IN CHARGE. HE SAID, FARMERS UNION, I MEAN, IT'S OPEN TO INTERPRETATION.
YOU1000000138_S0000049	WE DIDN'T JUST ARRIVE. THIS HAS BEEN WORKED ON FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. CONTACTS HAVE TO BE MADE.
YOU1000000138_S0000051	THEY DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. THEY MIGHT THINK THAT YOU'RE UNDERCOVER AMERICAN DRUG ENFORCEMENT.
YOU1000000138_S0000053	BY JUST PUTTING OURSELVES IN A REALLY STUPID SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN KILL US.
YOU1000000138_S0000055	THESE GUYS DON'T SEE THEMSELVES AS GANGSTERS. THEY ACTUALLY JUST SEE THEMSELVES AS BUSINESSMEN AND FARMERS.
YOU1000000138_S0000057	MAGUIRE CHARLES WOULDN'T ADMIT TO FARMING OPIUM, BUT HE DID SAY HE FARMED WHAT HE FARMED TO SURVIVE.
YOU1000000138_S0000059	ONE OF THE FIRST TALES HE TOLD US WHEN WE STARTED TALKING TO HIM WAS ABOUT HOW HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED. BUT THIS WASN'T AN ORDINARY ARREST. THREE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS HAD TURNED UP. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR JUST ANYBODY.
YOU1000000138_S0000063	THEY MAY LOOK VERY NORMAL, BUT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN A VERY, VERY DANGEROUS BUSINESS. IN MANY WAYS, THEY WERE A BIT LIKE THE MEXICAN SOPRANOS, IF YOU LIKE.
YOU1000000138_S0000065	HE WAS VERY AFFABLE, BUT THERE WAS NO FORGETTING THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS CHARACTER AND THAT THIS WAS ESSENTIALLY AN INTERVIEW, BUT WE WERE THE ONES BEING INTERVIEWED.
YOU1000000138_S0000067	I'VE BEEN HAVING LUNCH WITH MANY OF THESE FARMERS AND THEY ARE JUST REALLY LOVELY AND NICE PEOPLE. IF THEY HAVE TO KILL YOU, THEY KILL YOU. BUT IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE GOOD FRIENDS TO EACH OTHER.
YOU1000000138_S0000069	HE MADE THE PHONE CALL, AND WE WERE ALLOWED TO GO UP INTO THE JUNGLE, WHERE WE MET, BY SECURITY, GUYS CARRYING MACHINE GUNS, FULLY KITTED OUT, WITH THEIR FACES WITH BANDANAS.
YOU1000000138_S0000071	AND THEY TOOK US TO THE POPLAR QUARRY.
YOU1000000138_S0000073	AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OF REALLY ROUGH TERRAIN
YOU1000000138_S0000075	WE ARRIVED INTO THIS OPENING. IT LOOKED LIKE THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST HAD JUST BEEN COMPLETELY OPENED UP SO THAT THEY COULD GROW THE POPPIES.
YOU1000000138_S0000077	SO THIS IS THE POPPY OIL THAT BECOMES OPIUM AND EVENTUALLY THAT BECOMES
YOU1000000138_S0000079	YEAH, AND ALL THIS FIELD HAVING THIS.
YOU1000000138_S0000081	THE WEATHER'S PERFECT FOR IT AND IT JUST KEEPS PRODUCING. SO IT'S A BRILLIANT CROP OR WHY WOULDN'T IT BE? THE DEMAND IS SO HIGH AND AS LONG AS THE DEMAND IS HIGH AND WE KNOW THE BIGGEST USER IS THE UNITED STATES, THEN IT'S GOING TO KEEP BEING MADE.
YOU1000000138_S0000083	THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ASK THEM. YOU KNOW THAT WITH THIS THEY CREATE.
YOU1000000138_S0000085	YES, AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT CREATES LOTS OF PROBLEMS.
YOU1000000138_S0000086	YES, BUT...
YOU1000000138_S0000088	IF THEY DEMAND US AVOCADO, WE GROW AVOCADO.
YOU1000000138_S0000089	IT SEEMS INTERESTING THAT WHAT HAPPENS HERE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS SAY IN ACAPULCO, THEY'RE LINKED BUT NOBODY THINKS ABOUT IT, RIGHT?
YOU1000000138_S0000090	THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTION.
YOU1000000138_S0000092	I REMEMBER ONE FARMER TELL ME, YEAH, I KNOW THAT THIS IS POISON, BUT IF I DON'T CREATE THIS POISON, MY FAMILY IS GOING TO DIE.
YOU1000000138_S0000094	SPEAKING TO THEM, IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY CONSIDERED THERE WAS A REAL THREAT FROM RIVAL GANGS COMING IN TO TAKE THEIR CROP.
YOU1000000138_S0000095	IF WE DON'T HAVE A GUN TO PROTECT US, THEY WILL KILL US.
YOU1000000138_S0000097	NOBODY REALLY KNOWS HOW MUCH MONEY IS MADE BY THE DRUG CARTELS, BUT IT IS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
YOU1000000138_S0000099	AND IT'S NATIONWIDE, IT'S ABSOLUTELY EVERY CITY, EVERY TOWN, EVERY VILLAGE IN VARYING LEVELS.
YOU1000000138_S0000101	OF EITHER INVOLVEMENT IN THE DRUGS OR INVOLVEMENT IN CRIME THAT IS ACTUALLY PERPETUATED BY THIS WHOLE SOCIETY WHERE CRIMINALITY IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.
YOU1000000138_S0000103	WE WENT TO MEET A GUY WHO'S A HITMAN.
YOU1000000138_S0000105	HE EXPLAINED TO US IN DETAIL THE HITS THAT HE'S CARRYING OUT.
YOU1000000138_S0000107	YOU HAVE BUSINESS RIVALS NOW, NOT CARTELS, HIRING THIS GUY TO TAKE OUT RIVALS.
YOU1000000138_S0000109	IF I NEED TO FIX SOMETHING IN MY BUSINESS AND I THINK THAT MY PARTNER IS STEALING PART OF MY MONEY, I JUST CALL THIS GUY.
YOU1000000138_S0000111	THE BUSINESSMEN HE'S WORKING FOR, AND BUSINESSWOMEN AS HE WAS KEEN TO POINT OUT, WILL ACTUALLY ASK FOR REALLY HORRIBLE THINGS. HANDS CUT OFF, HEADS CUT OFF.
YOU1000000138_S0000112	IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF OFF THE SCALE VIOLENCE.
YOU1000000138_S0000114	HE, INTERESTINGLY, SAW ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO FEEL ANY TYPE OF REMORSE. AND ALTHOUGH HE'S QUITE PLEASANT AND HE'S PLEASANT TO US, HE'S A VERY, VERY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL.
YOU1000000138_S0000116	VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THIS SOCIETY HAS BECOME THE NORM.
YOU1000000138_S0000118	IT REALLY IS A MESS AND EVERYBODY WE SPEAK TO DOESN'T SEE AN END TO IT. IN FACT, THEY SEE IT GETTING WORSE.
YOU1000000138_S0000120	THE PROBLEM IS SO BIG AND SO INGRAINED, IS IT ACTUALLY
YOU1000000138_S0000122	POSSIBLE TO SORT OUT. IT'S BECOME PART OF SOCIETY.
YOU1000000138_S0000124	THE CRIME LEVELS AND THE SHEER AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FROM CRIME IS GUARANTEEING THAT MEXICO'S GOING TO SUFFER FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.
YOU1000000139_S0000001	I'M YARI KASPAROV AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF MY MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS AT THE CHESSBOARD.
YOU1000000139_S0000003	IT'S GAME 24 AGAINST ANTONI CARPOV, THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH, 1987 IN SEVILLA, SPAIN. I WAS TRAILING.
YOU1000000139_S0000005	12 TO 11 BEFORE THE LAST GAME. AND AS A WORLD CHAMPION, I HAD MY LAST CHANCE TO RETAIN THE TITLE BY BEATING KARPOV IN THIS GAME 24, CRUCIAL GAME 24. I WAS NOT RUSHING FROM THE BEGINNING. I TRIED TO PLAY A VERY QUIET, POSITIONAL GAME.
YOU1000000139_S0000006	WAITING FOR KARPOV'S MISTAKES. AND THE GAME WAS ADJOURNED TO BE RESUMED THE NEXT DAY.
YOU1000000139_S0000008	AND THE POSITION THAT YOU COULD SEE NOW, IT'S HARD TO ASSESS. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S WINNING FOR WHITE OR IT'S DRAW. I WOULD SAY IT'S 50 50. WHITE HAS AN EXTRA PAWN, AS YOU COULD SEE, BUT THEY'RE ALL PAWNS ON THE SAME SIDE.
YOU1000000139_S0000009	A LIMITED NUMBER OF PIECES, SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY FIND ANY WINNING PLAN FOR WHY.
YOU1000000139_S0000011	NEXT DAY, WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE STAGE, I WAS A COUPLE OF MINUTES EARLIER. I HAVE TO SAY THAT WITH MY COACHES, WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THIS, BUT WE COULDN'T FIND ANY DECISIVE IDEAS. AND THEN I SAW KARPOV ENTERING THE STAGE.
YOU1000000139_S0000013	THAT WAS THE CRUCIAL MOMENT BECAUSE I COULD LOOK AT HIS EYES, I COULD LOOK AT HIS BODY, AND HE LOOKED DOOMED.
YOU1000000139_S0000015	I COULD IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE COULD DEFEND THIS POSITION. AND THAT'S EVERYTHING. IT'S ABOUT YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN EITHER WIN OR DEFEND, AND THAT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME.
YOU1000000139_S0000016	SO KARPOV PLAYED G6 AND I WAS WAITING JUST PLAYING SOME UNIMPORTANT MOVES. QC5, QF7. EVEN IF THESE MOVES ARE UNIMPORTANT, IT ADDS CHANCES THAT YOU WILL MAKE A MISTAKE. AND AFTER H4, KARPOV MADE A DECISIVE MISTAKE.
YOU1000000139_S0000018	WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE AFTER THE ADJOURNMENT HE HAD TIME TO ANALYZE THIS POSITION HOME AND THIS MOVE, IT FIXES THE PAWN STRUCTURE. BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOW WHITE CAN EXCHANGE QUEENS AND BECAUSE THESE PAWNS ARE FIXED, THESE TWO WEAKNESSES, BLACK POSITION WILL BE LOST.
YOU1000000139_S0000019	AND EVENTUALLY I IMPROVED MY POSITION BY THREATENING TO EXCHANGE QUEENS AND PUSHED, PUSHED AND PUSHED AND EVENTUALLY WON THE GAME.
YOU1000000139_S0000021	SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CLEAREST MOMENTS WHERE YOU COULD SEE THE TRANSLATION OF YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL WEAKNESS INTO SERIOUS MISTAKES AT THE CHESSBOARD.
YOU1000000139_S0000023	IT IS ANOTHER MEMORABLE MOMENT, VERY PAINFUL ONE, I HAVE TO ADMIT. 1996, THE FINAL MATCH FOR GRAND PRIX EVENT RAPID BLITZ CHESS THAT I PLAYED AGAINST VISHY ANAND.
YOU1000000139_S0000025	I THINK I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE IT'S A BLITZ GAME, SO IT'S A FIVE MINUTE CHESS. IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING LONG TERM CALCULATIONS. THIS MOVE'S PLAYED BY INSTINCTS.
YOU1000000139_S0000027	WE PLAYED TWO BLITZ GAMES, THE FIRST ONE I WAS ALMOST LOSING BUT MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND THAT'S THE LAST DECISIVE GAME. I PLAYED WITH BLACK, TOTALLY OUTPLAYED HIM. AS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE POSITION, BLACK HAS TWO PAWNS. LET ME EMPHASIZE, TWO EXTRA PAWNS.
YOU1000000139_S0000029	AND TOTAL DOMINATION IN THE CENTER. SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH MOVE IS NOT WINNING. IF YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE, YOU'RE STILL WINNING. BUT I WANTED US TO EXCHANGE QUEENS. AND OF COURSE, YOU CAN TAKE WITH A KNIGHT HERE. AND THEN AFTER EXCHANGE OF QUEENS, IT'S AN ENDGAME WITH TWO EXTRA PAWNS.
YOU1000000139_S0000030	I THINK THAT MOST LIKELY, ANNA WOULD HAVE RESIGNED IF I JUST TAKE WITH A KNIGHT ON E3. BUT SUDDENLY I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, WHY TAKE WITH A KNIGHT IF I DO THE SAME BY EXCHANGING QUEENS BY TAKING WITH QUEEN?
YOU1000000139_S0000031	THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHITE DOES NOT HAVE TO, IS NOT FORCED TO TAKE THE QUEEN. ALL OF A SUDDEN HAS A MOVE QUEEN TAKES G4 AND INSTEAD OF HAVING WINNING POSITION, BLACK NOW IS LOST BECAUSE MY QUEEN IS ATTACKED.
YOU1000000139_S0000032	MY ROOK IS ATTACKED, MY BISHOP IS ATTACKED, AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000139_S0000034	SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WORST BLUNDERS. I MEAN, I COULDN'T SEE MY FACE. I COULD IMAGINE THIS ONE. THE HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF IMAGES SHOWING MY, CALL IT FRUSTRATION.
YOU1000000139_S0000036	AND IT COST ME THE VICTORY OF THE FINAL, BUT ALSO IT'S KIND OF A MEMORY SCORE. SO IT'S JUST, IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST, IT'S SITTING THERE.
YOU1000000139_S0000037	EVEN 20 YEARS LATER, I CANNOT LOOK AT THIS POSITION WITHOUT SOME SORT OF PAIN.
YOU1000000139_S0000039	ANOTHER VERY MEMORABLE AND VERY PAINFUL MOMENT.
YOU1000000139_S0000041	IT'S THE LAST GAME OF MY FAMOUS REMATCH AGAINST DEEP BLUE IN 1997 BECAUSE I WON THE FIRST ONE IN 1996. THE MATCH WAS A TIE. EACH SIDE WON ONE GAME WITH THREE DRAWS, PLAYED WITH BLACK PIECES.
YOU1000000139_S0000042	AND I MISSED MY CHANCES IN GAME FOUR AND FIVE. AND I WASN'T SURE WHEN I STARTED THE GAME AND I PICKED UP THE LINE THAT I NEVER PLAYED BEFORE.
YOU1000000139_S0000043	BUT THAT WAS MY HOPE THAT SINCE I NEVER PLAYED IT BEFORE AND IT WAS NOT PART OF MY OPENING REPERTOIRE, THAT COMPUTER WOULD NOT BE READY.
YOU1000000139_S0000045	AND I PLAY IN THIS POSITION VERY RISKY, TO BE PRECISE, BAD MOVE, H6, ATTACKING THE KNIGHT, AND PROVOKE WHITE TO SACRIFICE A PIECE, WHICH IS VERY STRONG. IT'S MAYBE NOT WINNING, BUT GIVES WHITE A VERY STRONG INITIATIVE.
YOU1000000139_S0000046	BUT MACHINES DON'T SACRIFICE A PIECE FOR A PAWN WITHOUT HAVING A CONCRETE OUTCOME INSIDE.
YOU1000000139_S0000048	SO I EXPECTED THAT COMPUTER WOULD GO BACK ON E4 BECAUSE THIS MOVE WAS NOT IN THE SPECIAL DATABASE PREPARED BY THE GRANDMASTER TEAM THAT WORKED WITH DEEP BLUE.
YOU1000000139_S0000049	AND TO MY HORROR, THEY BLEW IMMEDIATELY TO CORNER SIX, WHICH MEANT THAT THE MOVE WAS ALREADY PUT IN.
YOU1000000139_S0000051	I JUST COULDN'T PLAY THIS GAME. POSITION WAS PRETTY DANGEROUS AND BAD, BUT I LOST IT IN A FEW MOVES BECAUSE I WAS SHOCKED BY THE FACT THAT I JUST MADE SUCH A MISCALCULATION.
YOU1000000139_S0000053	I FOUND OUT LATER, MANY YEARS LATER, THAT I WAS RIGHT ON BOTH COUNTS. ONE IS THAT MACHINES DIDN'T PLAY SUCH MOVES. IT WAS JUST AGAINST MACHINES LOGIC. AND THAT WAS ADMITTED BY THE DEEP BLUE TEAM.
YOU1000000139_S0000054	SAYING DEEP BLUE WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THIS MOVE UNLESS THAT VERY MORNING THEY DECIDED TO INSTALL THIS OPENING POSITION IN THE OPENING BOOK. MAYBE IT'S THE MOST FAMOUS GAME IN THE HISTORY OF CHESS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHEER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED IT.
YOU1000000139_S0000055	MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT WHERE MACHINES ESTABLISHED ITS DOMINANCE OVER HUMAN PLAYERS. NOW, OF COURSE, THE FREE CHESS APP ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE TODAY IS STRONGER THAN THE BLUE.
YOU1000000139_S0000057	THIS IS ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME IN MY LIFE, GAME 24 AGAINST ANATOLY KARPOV IN OUR SECOND MATCH IN 1985.
YOU1000000139_S0000059	I WAS LEADING 12 11 BEFORE THE LAST GAME AND KARPOV HAD TO WIN TO RETAIN HIS TITLE.
YOU1000000139_S0000061	AND AS YOU CAN SEE, HE ACHIEVED A VERY PROMISING POSITION. IT'S A WIDE CONCENTRATION ON THE KING SIDE. IT'S MENACING. AND WHITE HAS QUITE A FEW OPTIONS. ONE IS JUST IT'S I SHOULD ALWAYS WATCH F5 AS THE AS A BREAKTHROUGH.
YOU1000000139_S0000062	ANOTHER ONE IS A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE TO PLAY BISHOP D4 JUST EXCHANGING THE BISHOP THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY DEFENDERS OF BLACK'S KING. AND IF BLACK GOES E5 THEN HE TAKES. NOW BECAUSE OF THE ATTACK ON F7 I HAVE TO TAKE WITH THE KNIGHT.
YOU1000000139_S0000064	BUT THEN QUEEN ACTUALLY CHANGES ITS DIRECTION ATTACKING H7 PAWN.
YOU1000000139_S0000066	SO THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR WHITE AND IT SEEMS THAT BLACK HAD NOTHING TO DO TO IMPROVE HIS POSITION.
YOU1000000139_S0000068	HERE, AFTER LONG THOUGHT, I FOUND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MOVES IN MY LIFE, AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT'S A PARADOX, BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR ROOK IN SUCH AN UGLY POSITION AS E7.
YOU1000000139_S0000069	BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO INSTEAD OF WHITE, YOU KNOW, PUSHING ON THE KING SIDE. THE GAME SHIFTED TO THE CENTER AND THE QUEEN SIDE, AND PRIORITY HERE IS TO DEFEND THE KING. ROOK HERE PROTECTS THIS PAWN AND NEUTRALIZES BOTH OF WHITE THREATS.
YOU1000000139_S0000070	AND THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WHITE INITIATIVE DOESN'T PRODUCE IMMEDIATE RESULTS, THEN EVENTUALLY BLACK CAN DO SOMETHING ACTIVE.
YOU1000000139_S0000072	AND I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I PLAYED ROOKIE 7 AND KARPOV CAME BACK TO THE CHESSBOARD FROM HIS GREEN ROOM, INSTANTLY YOU COULD FEEL THAT HE SENSED THAT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. HE DIDN'T LIKE IT, SO I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO GAIN EVEN MORE CONFIDENCE.
YOU1000000139_S0000074	YOUR CONFIDENCE IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR YOU, BUT SOMEHOW IT TRANSCENDS TO YOUR OPPONENT AND IT UNDERMINES YOUR OPPONENT'S CONFIDENCE.
YOU1000000139_S0000076	AND THE KARPOV MADE A QUIET MOVE, KG1. I PUT ANOTHER ROOK HERE, WHICH IS TOTALLY ODD BECAUSE BOTH ROOKS ARE JUST STANDING BEHIND THE PAWN ON E6. BUT I'M JUST FIGHTING AGAINST F5 AND THEN KD1, I EVEN PLAY F5.
YOU1000000139_S0000077	AND KARPOV TOOK AN AMPERSAND, I TOOK AN F6, AND THEN EVENTUALLY I SACRIFICED THE PAWN.
YOU1000000139_S0000079	GAME ENDED UP WITH A COMPLICATED POSITION THAT KARPOV HAD TO FORCE A DRAW, BUT HE DECIDED TO PRESS FORWARD BECAUSE DRAW DIDN'T MAKE ANY GOOD TO HIM. AND EVENTUALLY I WON THE GAME, WON THE MATCH AND WON MY TITLE. NOVEMBER 9, 1985.
YOU1000000139_S0000081	YOU HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RESIST PRESSURE AND SURVIVE AFTER PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOWS AND LOSSES. IT'S MORE OF A SHOW OF CHARACTER. AND WITH SOME GOOD TRAINING, IT'S NOT REALLY HARD TO REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL.
YOU1000000139_S0000082	THE DIFFICULTY STARTS WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR BIG TITLES AND JUST TO CLIMB TO THE TOP.
YOU1000000140_S0000000	THIS PARENTING THING IS HARD, MAN, YOU NEED PATIENCE. YOU GOTTA HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE TO DEAL WITH THESE KIDS. I'M NOT GONNA LIE, I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE. I'M LEARNING, I'M TRYING. CERTAIN THINGS MAKE ME MAD. LIKE, I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I TELL MY KIDS TO DO STUFF AND THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY.
YOU1000000140_S0000001	LIKE I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT I SAY, BUT I WANT YOU TO DO IT HOW I PICTURED YOU DOING IT. DON'T DO IT THE WAY YOU WANT TO DO IT. DO IT THE WAY I SAW YOU DO IT WHEN I TOLD YOU TO DO IT. IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING, BUT THIS IS SERIOUS TO ME. THE OTHER DAY MY SON, HE'S SOUPED UP OFF CANDY. HE RUNNING ALL OVER THE HOUSE.
YOU1000000140_S0000002	I GOT MAD. HEY, THAT'S IT. COME HERE. SHUT IT DOWN. GO TO BED. SWEAR TO GOD, THIS IS WHAT HE DID. THIS MADE ME SO MAD. STANDING UP, THIS IS WHAT HE DID. I SAID, GO TO BED. HE SAID, UGH.
YOU1000000140_S0000004	Y'ALL WAS SO MAD, WAKE YOUR DAMN ASS UP. YOU DON'T SLEEP STANDING UP.
YOU1000000140_S0000006	NOT NO VAMPIRE.
YOU1000000140_S0000008	I WAS MAD BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN WHY I WAS MAD. YOU DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES TILL YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOUR BODY.
YOU1000000140_S0000010	TO SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN.
YOU1000000140_S0000012	I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN GET MAD AT KIDS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO FIGHT.
YOU1000000140_S0000014	AND YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT A KID, MAN. KIDS ARE ASSHOLES. LIKE, MY DAUGHTER IS AN ASSHOLE.
YOU1000000140_S0000016	SHE IS, WE ARGUE, ME AND MY DAUGHTER HONESTLY ARGUE, SHE CAN'T EVEN TALK, SHE KNOW A COUPLE WORDS, RIGHT? SHE CAN PUT A COUPLE SENTENCES TOGETHER, BUT IT'S LIKE EVERY TIME I TELL HER SOMETHING, SHE ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY BACK. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT I SAY, SHE ALWAYS GOTTA GIVE ME SOMETHING BACK, AND IT MAKE ME MAD. WE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT OVER JUICE THE OTHER DAY,
YOU1000000140_S0000017	SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM, SHE WAS LIKE, DADDY JUICE. I SAID, NO, YOU HAD ENOUGH JUICE, GO GET SOME WATER. AND SHE LOOKED AT ME.
YOU1000000140_S0000019	AND I LOOKED AT HER, WHO THE FUCK YOU THINK YOU TALKING TO?
YOU1000000140_S0000021	SIT YOUR LITTLE ASS DOWN AND GET THE GODDAMN... I WAS SO MAD. I WAS MAD BECAUSE I KNEW SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY. SHE JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE, IN HER MIND, SHE WAS LIKE, YOU BLACK MIDGET BITCH. GET THE...
YOU1000000140_S0000022	GET THE JUICE, PUNK ASS DADDY. I KNEW THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS SAYING. I COULD TELL BY HER HAND MOVEMENT. SHE'S LIKE, ALL THIS, GOT, MM, MM. SHE'S LIKE, YOU BLACK MIDGET BITCH, GET THE, I WAS SO MAD.
YOU1000000140_S0000024	I AM A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PARENT. I DON'T LIKE BABYSITTING. I CAN ADMIT THAT. I DON'T LIKE WATCHING MY KIDS BY MYSELF. TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
YOU1000000140_S0000026	NO MAN DOES. NO MAN IN THIS ROOM IS A GOOD BABYSITTER. I CAN TELL YOU HOW EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM WATCHES KIDS. ALL WE DO, WE SIT ON THE COUCH AND LISTEN FOR SHIT.
YOU1000000140_S0000028	THAT'S HOW WE WATCH OUR KIDS. KIDS DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WHEN THEY WITH DAD. HEY! HEY!
YOU1000000140_S0000030	I KNOW Y'ALL NOT IN THAT TOILET.
YOU1000000140_S0000032	YOU BETTER NOT BE IN THAT TOILET!
YOU1000000140_S0000034	WE AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHING. I KNOW I'M GETTING OLDER NOW BECAUSE OF MY KIDS. I'M STARTING TO FUSS A LOT. THE OLDER YOU GET, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. YOU JUST WAKE UP ANGRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I BE MAD AT. YOU JUST WAKE UP MAD. WHEN YOU GOT MORE THAN ONE KID, YOU JUST WAKE UP ANGRY.
YOU1000000140_S0000035	HEY, WHO GOT THE THING WITH THE SHIT IN THE... ALL RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST... ALL RIGHT, HEY, HEADS AND BEDS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. HEADS AND BEDS, THAT'S MY SHIT.
YOU1000000140_S0000037	MY SON, I JUST YELL AT MY SON, BECAUSE HE 9 MONTHS. YOU KNOW, HE'S A MAN NOW. SO I YELL AT HIM JUST BECAUSE.
YOU1000000140_S0000039	I GET MAD. HOLD YOUR HEAD STILL, BOY!
YOU1000000140_S0000041	ALL DAY.
YOU1000000140_S0000043	I THINK KIDS PLAY TOO ROUGH. I DO. ME AND THIS BOY GOT INTO IT A CHUCK OF CHEESE. IT WASN'T A FIGHT, IT WAS AN ALTERCATION. WE GOT INTO A LITTLE ALTERCATION BECAUSE MY BABY WAS IN THE BALLS, HE WAS THROWING THE BALLS AT MY DAUGHTER HEAD. HE WAS THROWING THE BALLS, HIT MY DAUGHTER RIGHT IN THE HEAD.
YOU1000000140_S0000045	MY DAUGHTER SO DAMN STUPID SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A GAME. SHE PLAYING.
YOU1000000140_S0000047	SHE LIKE, DADDY, LOOK.
YOU1000000140_S0000049	SO I'M GETTING MAD, I'M LIKE, THROW A BALL BACK, I'M PISSED OFF. I LOOK AT MY SON, HE JUST LOOKING AT THE SHIT.
YOU1000000140_S0000051	WAS MAD AT THE WAY MY FAMILY LOOKED AS A UNIT
YOU1000000140_S0000053	WE DIDN'T LOOK GOOD AS A UNIT, MAN. LIKE, MY DAUGHTER, SHE TAKING BALLS TO THE FACE. MY SON SHAKING HIS HEAD AND SLOBBERING. I'M SMALL. WE LOOK LIKE A FUCKING CIRCUS ACT. I WAS SO PISSED OFF.
YOU1000000140_S0000055	I'VE NEVER BEEN SO MAD AT MY WIFE IN MY LIFE. I WAS LIKE, WHY WOULD YOU DRESS US IN DIFFERENT COLORS? WE LOOK LIKE CLOWNS. FROM NOW ON, SOLID COLORS WHEN WE GO OUT. WE LOOK LIKE A TEAM, SOLID COLORS.
YOU1000000140_S0000057	IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I TOLD MY LADY, I SAID, YO, I'M NOT TAKING OUT TRASH NO MORE. I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. SHE SAID, WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. I SAID, YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IT'S NOT A WOMAN'S JOB. IT'S A MAN'S JOB. I'M GOING TO MAKE MY SON DO IT.
YOU1000000140_S0000059	HE'S SEVEN YEARS OLD, TIME FOR HIM TO START PULLING HIS WEIGHT AROUND HERE. HE DON'T DO SHIT.
YOU1000000140_S0000061	THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT BEING A DAD. YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT, WHEN YOU WANT. CAN'T NOBODY SAY SHIT ABOUT IT. I WOKE MY SON UP AT 2 IN THE MORNING WITH A COMPLETE BULLSHIT STORY. I KICKED HIS BED. GET YOUR ASS UP. GET UP!
YOU1000000140_S0000063	THEN I TELL YOU YOU GET THAT GODDAMN TRASH OUT LAST NIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, THAT WAS A LIE. I NEVER SAID THAT. NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000140_S0000065	HE WOKE UP, HE WAS CONFUSED. WHAT? WHAT? NO. YOU NEVER SAID THAT. WHAT? CALLING ME A LIAR? YOU TELLING ME I'M LYING? GET YOUR ASS UP. GET THAT GODDAMN TRASH OUT.
YOU1000000140_S0000067	PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE FUCKING MY KIDS UP. MY SON, HE SAID, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU1000000140_S0000069	HE GOES, LET ME GET MY FLOPS. WHAT?
YOU1000000140_S0000071	I'M NOT A FIGHTER, MAN. I'M NOT. I WON'T ACT LIKE I AM.
YOU1000000140_S0000073	I WON'T. SEEN TOO MANY BAD THINGS HAPPEN. I SAW MY DAD GET KNOCKED OUT ONE TIME. I WAS 13. TRAUMATIZED ME. I GOT HIT BY MY DAD TWICE IN THE SAME SPOT. QUICK AS HELL.
YOU1000000140_S0000075	QUICKEST TWO PUNCHES I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. HIT MY DAD SO FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT, MY DAD STOPPED FIGHTING AND ASKED ME WHAT HAPPENED. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT.
YOU1000000140_S0000077	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT, THEY'RE LIKE, BAH BAH, SHIT! HEY! KEVIN! HEY! HE JUST HIT ME TWICE!
YOU1000000140_S0000079	YES, YES HE DID. ARE YOU SURE IT WAS HIM?
YOU1000000140_S0000081	IT'S ONLY Y'ALL TWO OUT HERE, DAD. AIN'T NOBODY ELSE OUT HERE WITH Y'ALL. SO YOU TELLING ME HE THAT FAST? THEY NOT JUMPING ME? AIN'T NOBODY JUMPING ME?
YOU1000000140_S0000083	NO, NO, ANYBODY JUMP YOU, IT'S JUST HIM. WELL, HE MUST BE AN OCTOPUS BECAUSE I SAW A LOT OF STUFF GOING BY MY FACE. REALLY? REALLY, DAD? AN OCTOPUS? THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST THOUGHT?
YOU1000000140_S0000085	A HUMAN OCTOPUS, REALLY? WHEN MY DAD CAUGHT ANOTHER GROWN ASS MAN AN OCTOPUS, THAT WAS THE DAY THAT HE STOPPED BEING MY DAD. I LOST ALL RESPECT.
YOU1000000140_S0000087	HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THOUGH, HE'S STILL TRYING TO DISCIPLINE ME AROUND THE HOUSE. KEVIN! HEY! DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO GET THE TRASH OUT? GET UP! GET THE TRASH OUT BEFORE I CRACK YOUR DAMN FACE. SHUT UP. SHUT UP!
YOU1000000140_S0000088	YOU GET THE TRASH OUT IF I GET STEVE TO COME OVER HERE PUT HIS DAMN HANDS ON YOU AGAIN. OH, OH
YOU1000000140_S0000090	OH, YOU GONNA GET STEVE, HUH? YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE, YOU KNOW THAT? YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE. GIVE ME THE TRASH. I'LL TAKE TRASH OUT.
YOU1000000140_S0000092	GIVE HIM THE TRASH.
YOU1000000140_S0000094	MY SON GOES DOWNSTAIRS, HE GRABS THE TRASH. HE'S ABOUT TO WALK OUTSIDE, HE SEES IT'S REAL DARK. HE GOES, DAD, IT'S REAL DARK OUTSIDE. CAN YOU COME WITH ME?
YOU1000000140_S0000096	NO, NO I CANNOT. NO. THAT'S NOT MY JOURNEY SON, THIS IS YOUR JOURNEY. IT'S ABOUT YOU BECOMING A MAN, YOU GOTTA DO THIS BY YOURSELF. MY SON GRABS THE TRASH, HE'S LITERALLY WALKING OUTSIDE.
YOU1000000140_S0000097	HE GOES DOWN THE DRIVEWAY. I COULD TELL WHEN HE GOT SCARED, BECAUSE HE STOPPED. HE STARTED DOING THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE. HE STARTED LOOKING AROUND.
YOU1000000140_S0000099	WHEN HE LOOKED AT ME, I SAID, SEE, THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE DOING THAT SHIT. GO. YOU ALL RIGHT. FINISH. FINISH. HE PUT THE TRASH IN THE TRASH CAN, START WALKING BACK. OUT OF NOWHERE, MY SON TAKES OFF RUNNING.
YOU1000000140_S0000100	I MEAN RUNNING, HAUL ASSING TOWARDS THE HOUSE, RUNNING AS FAST AS HE CAN. I GOT SCARED BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE WHAT HE WAS RUNNING FROM.
YOU1000000140_S0000102	I COULDN'T SEE IT.
YOU1000000140_S0000104	SO I CLOSED THE DOOR. I CLOSED THE DOOR.
YOU1000000140_S0000106	NO, I DID. I KNOW IT'S WRONG, BUT I DID IT. I DON'T WANT TO LIE. I SHUT THE DOOR.
YOU1000000140_S0000108	I TOLD MYSELF DEPENDING ON WHAT IT WAS, WAS GOING TO DETERMINE IF I OPEN UP THE DOOR OR NOT WHEN HE GOT BACK.
YOU1000000140_S0000110	IF IT WAS SOMETHING CRAZY, I WAS JUST GONNA PUT MY HAND ON THE GLASS. I WAS GONNA SAY, SON, TOUCH THE GLASS ONE LAST TIME. I HATE THAT IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY.
YOU1000000140_S0000112	I'M REAL SCARED OF GORILLAS.
YOU1000000140_S0000114	I AM, BECAUSE IT WAS DADDY DAY, I WAS AT THE ZOO. IT WAS ME AND MY BABIES, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I'M BY MYSELF.
YOU1000000140_S0000115	GOT MY SON IN MY ARM, MY DAUGHTER RIGHT HERE, WE LOOKING AT THE GORILLAS. WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE GORILLAS, I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY DAUGHTER WHAT A GORILLA IS. YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M TALKING, THE GORILLA SMACK THE GLASS REAL HARD.

YOU1000000140_S0000126	MY DAD ALMOST KILLED ME ONE TIME. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I COULDN'T SWIM. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW. MY DAD DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.
YOU1000000140_S0000128	WE HAD A POOL, I'M SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE POOL, I GOT MY FEET IN THE WATER. I'M PLAYING, HAVING A GOOD TIME.
YOU1000000140_S0000129	MY DAD SAID, BOY, YOU BETTER STOP PLAYING, GET IN THAT WATER AND SWIM. I SAID, DAD, I CAN'T. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM. HE SAID, YOU KNOW HOW TO FUCKING SWIM. GET IN THAT GODDAMN WATER AND SWIM. I SAID, NO, DAD, I'M SERIOUS. NOBODY EVER TAUGHT ME HOW TO SWIM. MY DAD PICKED ME UP, GRABBED ME, THREW ME IN SEVEN FEET.
YOU1000000140_S0000130	AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER, I STARTED TO DIE IMMEDIATELY.
YOU1000000140_S0000132	THIS IS WHY MY DAD AN ASSHOLE. THIS IS WHAT MY DAD SAID. HEY, YOU BETTER NOT FUCKING DROWN. I SAID, WHAT?
YOU1000000140_S0000134	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP IT.
YOU1000000140_S0000136	WHEN I TELL YOU THAT WAS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE RIDE HOME I'VE EVER HAD WITH MY DAD IN MY LIFE, KEEP IN MIND I ALMOST DIED. WHENEVER YOU COME CLOSE TO DEATH, YOU BECOME TRAUMATIZED. HARD TO GET THAT SHIT OUT YOUR HEAD.
YOU1000000140_S0000138	I KEPT HAVING FLASHBACKS. WE IN THE CAR, WE DRIVING HOME, I'M LOOKING OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW. I KEPT REPLAYING THAT SHIT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WAS LIKE, NO, NO, NO, DON'T LET ME GO, DAD. DON'T LET ME GO.

YOU1000000142_S0000010	WHITE FOLKS, PLEASE BEAT YOUR CHILDREN, BECAUSE NON WHITE PARENTS WILL BEAT THEIR KIDS. YOUR DAD'S PUERTO RICAN, YOUR MOM'S BLACK, THEY MUST HAVE WHOOPED YOUR ASS FOR NO REASON SOMETIMES, HUH?

YOU1000000142_S0000018	MY DAD'S THEORY WAS IF I GET RID OF ONE, I'LL JUST MAKE ANOTHER ONE. THEN I WILL TELL THE NEW ONE WHAT AN IDIOT THE LAST ONE WAS.
YOU1000000142_S0000020	YOU GOTTA BEAT YOUR KIDS, FOLKS, PLEASE. AND I KNOW A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE DON'T BEAT THEM, AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WON'T BEAT YOUR KIDS. PLEASE BEAT THEM. IF YOU HAVE KIDS, AND YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THEM, WHEN YOU GO HOME TONIGHT...

YOU1000000142_S0000039	BEAT THEM, PLEASE, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY YOU NEED TO BEAT THEM, WHY ELSE? BECAUSE WHEN WHITE KIDS HANG AROUND NON WHITE KIDS, WE TEND TO LOOK AT THEM FOR ADVICE.
YOU1000000142_S0000041	AND IT COULD GET US MURDERED IF WE LISTEN TO THEIR FUCKED UP ADVICE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH OUR PARENTS. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD I HUNG AROUND THIS LITTLE WHITE KID, RYAN.
YOU1000000142_S0000043	RYAN'S PARENTS NEVER BEAT HIM AND THEY NEVER EVEN YELLED AT HIM. HE COULD DO ANYTHING HE WANTED AND NOTHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM. BUT HE WAS AN ANGRY KID. WE WALKED INTO HIS HOUSE AFTER SCHOOL ONE DAY, HIS MOM GOES, RYAN, GO CLEAN YOUR ROOM! FUCK YOU, BITCH!
YOU1000000142_S0000045	HIS MOM GOES, WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH HIM?

YOU1000000142_S0000067	THAT WAS MY DAD'S THREAT RIGHT BEFORE HE'D BEAT ME EVERY SINGLE TIME.
YOU1000000142_S0000069	SOMEBODY GONNA GET A HURT REAL BAD. I HATED THAT THREAT. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE'D ALWAYS SAY SOMEBODY.
YOU1000000142_S0000071	HE'D NEVER TELL YOU IT WAS YOU. I MEAN YOU KNEW IT WAS YOU, BUT HE'D GIVE YOU THIS HOPE.
YOU1000000142_S0000073	SOMEBODY GOING TO GET HURT REAL BAD.
YOU1000000142_S0000075	SOMEBODY.

YOU1000000142_S0000081	I SAW THAT LITTLE BRAT RYAN AT SCHOOL A FEW DAYS LATER, I WAS LIKE, YO, YOUR LITTLE PLAN ALMOST GOT ME KILLED. HE GOES, OH, SORRY, DUDE. I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THE OTHER PART. IF HE'S STILL GOING TO HIT YOU, THREATEN TO PHONE CHILD SERVICES.
YOU1000000142_S0000083	WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU PHONE CHILD SERVICES, THEY'LL COME AND TAKE YOUR DAD AWAY AND HE'LL GET IN TROUBLE. YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE TO CALL. JUST PRETEND IT'LL SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.
YOU1000000142_S0000085	YOU'RE 10 YEARS OLD, YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR DAD? THAT'S LIKE FINDING KRYPTONITE.
YOU1000000142_S0000087	I THOUGHT I'D TRY IT. I WAS ABOUT TO GET MY NEXT BEATING. I STOPPED MY DAD AND GO, DON'T DO IT.
YOU1000000142_S0000089	OUR PHONE CHILD SERVICES.
YOU1000000142_S0000091	YOU EVER HAD YOUR PARENTS CALL YOUR BLUFF? YOU'LL DO WHAT?
YOU1000000142_S0000093	OUR PHONE CHILD SERVICES. IS THAT RIGHT?
YOU1000000142_S0000095	WELL, LET ME GET YOU THE PHONE, TOUGH GUY.
YOU1000000142_S0000097	WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IF I PHONE CHILD SERVICES, YOU'LL GET IN TROUBLE. I MIGHT GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE. BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM 22 MINUTES TO GET HERE.
YOU1000000142_S0000099	IN THAT TIME, SOMEBODY GONNA GET HURT REAL BAD.

YOU1000000143_S0000009	I GREW UP IN CHINA. WHO DIDN'T?
YOU1000000143_S0000011	AND MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES ARE TOTALLY RUINED BY MY CHILDHOOD.
YOU1000000143_S0000013	WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AS PART OF THE CURRICULUM, I HAD TO WORK AT A RICE PADDY RIGHT NEXT TO A QUARRY WHERE THEY USED EXPLOSIVES TO BREAK ROCKS.
YOU1000000143_S0000015	AND THAT IS WHERE I LEARNED THAT LIGHT TRAVELS FASTER THAN SOUND.
YOU1000000143_S0000017	WHICH IS ALMOST AS SLOW AS A FLYING ROCK.
YOU1000000143_S0000019	MY DAD WAS A GRUMPY GUY, BUT OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD TRY TO CHEER ME UP WITH JOKES. BUT HE DOESN'T DO IT RIGHT. WHEN I WAS SEVEN, ONE DAY HE SAID TO ME, HEY SON, WHY IS TOFU
YOU1000000143_S0000020	BETTER THAN CENTRALIZED SOCIALIST ECONOMY.
YOU1000000143_S0000022	SO FIVE MINUTES LATER I SAID, WHY?
YOU1000000143_S0000024	IS THAT BECAUSE I SAID SO?
YOU1000000143_S0000026	I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN I WAS 24 TO STUDY AT RICE UNIVERSITY IN TEXAS.
YOU1000000143_S0000028	THAT WASN'T A JOKE.
YOU1000000143_S0000030	UNTIL NOW.
YOU1000000143_S0000032	AND I WAS DRIVING THIS USED CAR WITH A LOT OF BUMPER STICKERS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PEEL OFF. AND ONE OF THEM SAID, IF YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, GO HOME.
YOU1000000143_S0000034	AND I DIDN'T NOTICE IT FOR TWO YEARS.
YOU1000000143_S0000036	AND LIKE MANY OTHER IMMIGRANTS, WE WANT OUR SON TO BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT BILINGUAL, YOU KNOW, CHINESE AT HOME AND ENGLISH IN THE PUBLIC.
YOU1000000143_S0000037	WHICH IS REALLY TOUGH TO DO BECAUSE MANY TIMES I HAVE TO SAY TO HIM IN PUBLIC, HEY LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, GO HOME.
YOU1000000143_S0000039	AND HE WOULD SAY TO ME, HEY DAD, WHY DO I HAVE TO LEARN TWO LANGUAGES? I SAID, SON, ONCE YOU BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SIGN LEGISLATIVE BILLS IN ENGLISH.
YOU1000000143_S0000040	I TALKED TO DEBT COLLECTORS IN CHINESE.
YOU1000000143_S0000042	WHEN I GRADUATED FROM RICE, I DECIDED TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE IN CHINA, I CAN'T DO THE THING I DO BEST HERE, BEING ETHNIC.

YOU1000000143_S0000056	I READ SO MUCH ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY THAT I STARTED TO HARBOR WHITE GUILT.
YOU1000000143_S0000058	AND IN AMERICA THEY SAY THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, BUT AFTER BIRTH, IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE PARENT'S INCOME FOR EARLY EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE.
YOU1000000143_S0000060	I READ IN THE MASS HEALTH MAGAZINE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA EVERY WEEK HAS TWO CARDIO DAYS AND FOUR WEIGHT LIFTING DAYS.
YOU1000000143_S0000062	YOU SEE, I DON'T HAVE TO EXERCISE BECAUSE I HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.
YOU1000000143_S0000064	I LIVE IN MASSACHUSETTS NOW, WHERE WE HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. THEN WE ELECTED SCOTT BROWN.

YOU1000000143_S0000082	AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING TOO SOFT. BUT HE WAS CONDUCTING TWO WARS, AND THEY STILL GAVE HIM THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
YOU1000000143_S0000084	AND HE ACCEPTED IT.
YOU1000000143_S0000086	YOU CAN'T BE MORE BADASS THAN THAT.
YOU1000000143_S0000088	WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M THINKING THE ONLY WAY IT CAN BE MORE BADASS THAN THAT IS IF YOU TAKE THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE MONEY AND GIVE IT TO THE MILITARY.

YOU1000000144_S0000137	A 1 VS 5 DEFIED MAP POINT TO BAIL OUT NA'VI.
YOU1000000144_S0000139	NOT EVEN THAT MUCH EXCITEMENT OVER THERE. I THOUGHT THEY'D BE SCREAMING. THERE IT IS. SMILE IN HIS FACE.
YOU1000000147_S0000000	TIRED OF EATING THE SAME OLD FOOD? FANCY A TASTE OF SOME OF THE FINEST INGREDIENTS MONEY CAN BUY?
YOU1000000147_S0000001	A MEAL LIKE THIS ONE WOULD SET YOU BACK MORE THAN JUST A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS. DON'T BELIEVE ME?
YOU1000000147_S0000002	STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT ABOUT SOME FOODS THAT ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE RICH.
YOU1000000147_S0000004	COFFIN BAY KING OYSTERS. LET'S KICK THINGS OFF WITH ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS ENTREES AROUND, OYSTERS. UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO BE DROWNING IN CASH,
YOU1000000147_S0000005	THESE BABIES PROBABLY AREN'T PART OF YOUR TYPICAL FRIDAY NIGHT DINNER. THERE ARE MANY VARIETIES OF THIS LEGENDARY DELICACY, BUT JUST ONE CAN BE NAMED THE LITERAL KING OF ALL OYSTERS.
YOU1000000147_S0000006	THE COFFIN BAY KING OYSTER, GROWN EXCLUSIVELY ON A FARM LOCATED WITHIN A SHELTERED PENINSULA OFF THE AUSTRALIAN WEST COAST.
YOU1000000147_S0000007	THESE WALLET BUSTING MOLLUSCS COME WITH A HEFTY PRICE TAG OF ABOUT $75 A POP. AFTER BEING GROWN FOR SIX YEARS RATHER THAN THE USUAL 18 MONTHS,
YOU1000000147_S0000008	AND EACH BAD BOY CAN WEIGH UP TO TWO POUNDS, MEANING THEY CAN HAVE UP TO 10 TIMES MORE MEAT THAN THEIR RUN OF THE MILL COUSINS.
YOU1000000147_S0000009	THEIR STRONG AROMA AND COMPLEX TASTE HAVE EARNED THEM THE TITLE OF THE OYSTER STEAK OF THE OCEAN.
YOU1000000147_S0000010	BUT IF YOU WANNA SHELL OUT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF, YOU'LL HAVE TO HEAD DOWN TO AUSTRALIA'S AYR PENINSULA.
YOU1000000147_S0000011	ALMAS CAVIAR. OYSTERS ARE A GREAT APPETIZER, BUT IF YOU WANNA GET REAL SWANKY, WHY NOT THROW IN SOME CAVIAR?
YOU1000000147_S0000012	BEHOLD THE ALMIGHTY ALMAS CAVIAR, WHICH'LL SET YOU BACK A COOL $25,000 FOR A 2.2 POUND 10.
YOU1000000147_S0000013	OF COURSE, THE TIN IS MADE OF METAL WHICH HAS BEEN BATHED IN 24 KARAT GOLD, SO IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY, RIGHT?
YOU1000000147_S0000014	CAVIAR IS USUALLY MADE FROM THE EGGS OF THE SAVRUGA, OCETRA, AND BELUGA SPECIES OF STURGEON FISH.
YOU1000000147_S0000015	BUT THIS WHITE CAVIAR COMES EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE ALBINO BELUGA STURGEON, WHICH LIVES IN THE CASPIAN SEA.
YOU1000000147_S0000016	BECAUSE THEIR ALBINISM IS CAUSED BY A GENETIC DISORDER, ALBINO BELUGAS ARE EXTREMELY RARE NOWADAYS.
YOU1000000147_S0000017	THAT DOESN'T STOP THE FILTHY RICH FROM DASHING THEIR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL EVEN MORE BY EATING THEIR EGGS ANYWAY.
YOU1000000147_S0000018	THE PEARL LIKE EGGS ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE SPECIMENS OVER 100 YEARS OLD AND ARE SAID TO BOAST AN INTENSE, NUTTY, CREAMY TASTE BEST ENJOYED ON TOAST OR OVER ICE WITH VODKA TO FINISH.
YOU1000000147_S0000019	ALMOST CAVIAR CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED FROM ONE OF THE FEW SELECT CAVIAR HOUSE AND PRUNIER STORES IN LONDON. AND DID I MENTION IT'S COMMONLY EATEN WITH A PEARL SPOON?
YOU1000000147_S0000020	BIRD'S NEST SOUP. HAVE YOU EVER FELT COMPELLED TO CLIMB A TREE AND CHOW DOWN ON AN ENTIRE BIRD'S NEST? OR BETTER YET, TAKE IT HOME AND TURN IT INTO SOUP?
YOU1000000147_S0000021	BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BIRD'S NEST SOUP IS A MAJOR DELICACY IN CHINA, COSTING ANYWHERE BETWEEN $2,500 TO $10,000 PER KILOGRAM.
YOU1000000147_S0000022	THESE AREN'T ANY OLD BIRDS' NESTS, BUT THE NESTS OF SWALLOWS OR SWIFTLETS WHICH ARE MADE FROM 100% SALIVA.
YOU1000000147_S0000023	THAT'S RIGHT, THESE BIRDS MAKE THEIR BABIES' HOMES OUT OF THEIR OWN SOLIDIFIED SPIT, AND SOME CULINARY CONNOISSEURS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE STUFF.
YOU1000000147_S0000024	WHEN THEY'RE BOILED IN WATER, THE DELICATENESS DISSOLVE INTO A GELATINOUS GOOP WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY PERFECT FOR SOUPS. YUMMY!
YOU1000000147_S0000025	THE ASKING PRICE OF ABOUT $100 PER BOWL CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO HOW HARD THE NESTS ARE TO GET A HOLD OF IN THE FIRST PLACE.
YOU1000000147_S0000026	CLIMBERS MUST SCALE THE DARK AND DIZZYING HEIGHTS OF THE MADAI CAVES IN MALAYSIA TO SCOUT FOR NESTS THAT ARE READY FOR THE PICKING.
YOU1000000147_S0000027	IDEALLY AFTER ONE BATCH OF EGGS IS HATCHED, BUT BEFORE A SECOND. AFTER THAT, EACH TINY FEATHER MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY REMOVED BY HAND.
YOU1000000147_S0000028	A.M. SIMONE BLACK CHICKEN. CHICKEN ISN'T THE MOST UNIQUE MENU ITEM, BUT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE LIKE THIS BEFORE?
YOU1000000147_S0000029	THE AYAM SEMANI CHICKEN, WHICH HAILS FROM INDONESIA, ISN'T JUST COATED IN JET BLACK FEATHERS, IT'S TOTALLY BLACK ON THE INSIDE TOO.
YOU1000000147_S0000030	THIS LAMBORGHINI POULTRY GROWS AT A SLOWER RATE AND SUPPOSEDLY TASTES SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN YOUR EVERYDAY KIND. BUT SOMALIS AREN'T ACTUALLY EATING FOR THEIR FLAVOR.
YOU1000000147_S0000031	THE REASON FOR ITS ELUSIVENESS AND DESIRABILITY IS THAT THE BIRD CAN BE TRACED BACK TO JAPANESE FOLKLORE OF THE 12TH CENTURY.
YOU1000000147_S0000032	WHERE IT WAS CONSIDERED A MYSTICAL FOOD OF THE ELITE. ITS CHARCOAL COLORED BLOOD IS ALSO RUMORED TO BRING POWER AND WEALTH UPON THOSE WHO CONSUME IT, MAKING IT A SOUGHT AFTER GOOD LUCK CHARM IN CERTAIN CULTURES.
YOU1000000147_S0000033	CIMANTES ARE HARD TO COME BY IN THE US, SO THE ASKING PRICE CAN BE UP TO $2,000 FOR A FULL GROWN BIRD AND $200 FOR A SINGLE NEWBORN CHICK.
YOU1000000147_S0000034	KOBE BEEF
YOU1000000147_S0000035	STEAK MAKES A MEAN MAIN COURSE, BUT IF YOU WANT A TRULY PREMIUM EXPERIENCE, THERE'S ONE KIND THAT'LL DO THE JOB.
YOU1000000147_S0000036	KOBE BEEF. THESE ILLUSTRIOUS CUTS OF MEAT ARE PROCURED FROM THE TAJIMA GU BREED OF JAPANESE WAGYU CATTLE WHICH ARE RAISED IN THE KOBE REGION.
YOU1000000147_S0000037	THE ANIMALS ARE SO WELL ESTEEMED THAT THEY LIVE LIKE KINGS. THEY'RE MASSAGED DAILY, PLAYED CLASSICAL MUSIC, AND EVEN FED BEER TO INDUCE THEIR APPETITE.
YOU1000000147_S0000038	KOBE BEEF IS RENOWNED FOR ITS SUPERIOR FLAVOR, TENDERNESS AND HIGH AMOUNT OF INTERMUSCULAR FAT, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO ITS MELT IN THE MOUTH QUALITIES.
YOU1000000147_S0000039	ALL WAGYU BEEF IS RATED ON A MARBLING SCALE OF 1 12 BASED ON THIS DISTRIBUTION OF FAT, AND KOBE BEEF ONLY QUALIFIES IF IT SCORES BETWEEN 10 12.
YOU1000000147_S0000040	THE LUXURY BEEF MARKET HAS EVEN BEEN TAINTED BY CONTROVERSY AFTER NUMEROUS ESTABLISHMENTS TRIED TO PASS OFF REGULAR WAGYU BEEF AS KOBE.
YOU1000000147_S0000041	WITH KOBE FRAUD RAMPANT IN THE US, ALL CUTS MUST NOW BE ASSIGNED A 10 DIGIT ID NUMBER SO THAT IT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE ACCOUNT IT CAME FROM.
YOU1000000147_S0000042	RESTAURATEURS MUST ALSO CARRY A LICENSE OF AUTHENTICITY THAT CAN BE SHOWN ON DEMAND.
YOU1000000147_S0000043	SO IF YOU'RE A BEEF AFICIONADO, IT'S WORTH CHECKING BEFORE SHELLING OUT UP TO $300 FOR A SINGLE POUND OF MEAT.
YOU1000000147_S0000044	BLONDE AQUA TAIN
YOU1000000147_S0000046	STEAK.
YOU1000000147_S0000047	FOR THOSE RICH ENOUGH TO TAKE A BEEN THERE DONE THAT APPROACH TO KOBE BEEF, PERHAPS BLONDE TO AQUATAINE STEAK IS MORE YOUR FORTE.
YOU1000000147_S0000048	THIS RARE BEEF IS CONSIDERED THE MOST EXPENSIVE STEAK IN THE WORLD, AND YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY ABOUT $3,200 FOR JUST ONE CUT.
YOU1000000147_S0000049	THE MEAT COMES FROM PRIZED FREE RANGE BLANC D'AQUITAINE CATTLE AND IS PRODUCED BY PARISIAN BUTCHER ALEXANDRE PAULMARD ON HIS FAMILY FARM IN NORTHEASTERN FRANCE.
YOU1000000147_S0000050	THE EXTORTIONATE PRICE TAG IS THANKS TO THE TECHNIQUE POMAR DEVELOPED IN THE 1990S TO TREAT THE MEAT.
YOU1000000147_S0000051	THE CATTLE ARE HAND REARED AND FREE TO ROAM THE FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS OF THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE, AND ONLY FOUR ARE KILLED WEEKLY.
YOU1000000147_S0000052	EACH COW IS THEN SLAUGHTERED HUMANELY TO MAKE THE PROCESS AS STRESS FREE AS POSSIBLE AND TO KEEP ACIDITY LEVELS AT A MINIMUM.
YOU1000000147_S0000053	THE MEAT IS THEN STORED IN A ROOM AND PUMPED WITH A CONSTANT STREAM OF AIR AT SPEEDS OF ALMOST 75 MILES PER HOUR.
YOU1000000147_S0000054	AND TEMPERATURES OF NEGATIVE 45 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, WHERE IT REMAINS IN THIS STATE OF FORCED HIBERNATION FOR 15 YEARS.
YOU1000000147_S0000055	TO SEE IF IT'S REALLY WORTH IT, YOU'LL HAVE TO VISIT PULLMAN'S STORE IN PARIS. VERY FEW RESTAURANTS ARE ENTRUSTED WITH THE BEEF AND PULLMAN PAYS EACH ESTABLISHMENT A PERSONAL VISIT BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN ALLOWED TO SERVE IT.
YOU1000000147_S0000056	LOB KNOT POTATOES.
YOU1000000147_S0000057	THE POTATO IS ONE OF THE MOST HUMBLE FOODS AROUND, BUT NOT WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOUGHT AFTER LABANAT VARIETY, AKA THE WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE POTATO.
YOU1000000147_S0000058	THESE SPUDS ARE SO WELL REGARDED THAT THEY'RE EVEN KNOWN AS THE CAVIAR OF THE POTATO WORLD.
YOU1000000147_S0000059	WHY, YOU ASK? FIRSTLY, THEY'RE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY GROWN ON THE TINY ISLAND OF NOIRMOUTIER OFF THE COAST OF WESTERN FRANCE, AND ONLY ABOUT 20 TONS ARE PRODUCED YEARLY.
YOU1000000147_S0000060	PREPARING THEM FOR SALE IS ALSO AN ARDUOUS PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO DELICATE TO BE MACHINE HARVESTED.
YOU1000000147_S0000061	SO EACH POTATO MUST BE CAREFULLY HAND PICKED INSTEAD. WITH ALL THE ADDED EFFORT IT TAKES TO GET A HOLD OF THEM, YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY LABANAT POTATOES ARE WORTH EATING TO BEGIN WITH.
YOU1000000147_S0000062	FANS OF THE SOUPED UP SPUDS SAY THE SEA AIR AND SEA WATER, WHICH ACTS AS A FERTILIZER FOR THE SOIL, GIVES THE POTATOES A HINT OF SEA SALT AND EVEN A SUGGESTION OF LEMON.
YOU1000000147_S0000063	IF YOU FANCY LABANAUTS FOR TEA, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THAT THEY SELL FOR ABOUT $300 PER POUND.
YOU1000000147_S0000064	WHITE TRUFFLES.
YOU1000000147_S0000065	IF THERE'S ONE THING CAPABLE OF ELEVATING A DISH TO NEW LAYERS OF PRESTIGE, IT'S TRUFFLES. THESE FRAGRANT FUNGI ARE SOME OF THE WORLD'S RAREST DELICACIES.
YOU1000000147_S0000066	AND EVEN THE ROMANS COULDN'T GET ENOUGH, ATTRIBUTING THEM WITH THERAPEUTIC AND APHRODISIAC PROPERTIES.
YOU1000000147_S0000067	WHITE TRUFFLES, OR THE DIAMOND OF THE KITCHEN, ARE BY FAR THE BEST. THE KNOBBLY WHITE MUSHROOMS CAN ONLY BE HARVESTED BETWEEN OCTOBER THROUGH DECEMBER.
YOU1000000147_S0000068	IN THE FOREST OF PIEDMONT IN NORTHERN ITALY, WHERE THEY GROW INCHES BELOW THE EARTH WITH THE ROOTS OF HARDWOOD TREES, WHICH MEANS FINDING THEM ISN'T EASY.
YOU1000000147_S0000069	SPECIALLY TRAINED DOGS OR PIGS, KNOWN AS TREFOCULTEURS, MUST SCOUR THE FOREST FLOOR IN SEARCH OF HIDDEN GEMS BELOW THE EARTH.
YOU1000000147_S0000070	SCIENTISTS HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO DOMESTICATE WHITE TRUFFLES, MEANING YOU ALSO WON'T BE STUMBLING UPON ANY IN YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET ANYTIME SOON.
YOU1000000147_S0000071	THESE FACTORS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FERVOR SURROUNDING TRUFFLES AND THE VALUE THEIR COMPLEX FLAVOR CAN BRING TO RISOTTO, PASTA, AND EVEN FOIE GRAS. JUST ONE POUND OF WHITE TRUFFLES COSTS AROUND $2,000.
YOU1000000147_S0000072	AND IN 2009, A RECORD BREAKING SINGLE 1.6 POUND SPECIMEN WAS EVEN AUCTIONED FOR AN EYE WATERING $150,000.
YOU1000000147_S0000073	KOPI LUWAK COFFEE
YOU1000000147_S0000074	MANY PEOPLE ENJOY AN AFTER DINNER BEVERAGE, AND IF YOU'RE ENTERTAINING GUESTS WITH PARTICULARLY DEEP POCKETS, PERHAPS ONLY KOPI LUWAK COFFEE WILL SUFFICE.
YOU1000000147_S0000075	LEGEND HAS IT THIS HIGHLY VALUED COFFEE WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN INDONESIA UNDER DUTCH COLONIAL RULE.
YOU1000000147_S0000076	NATIVE FARMERS AND PLANTATION WORKERS WERE FORBIDDEN FROM HARVESTING COFFEE FOR THEIR OWN USE AND WERE LEFT TO SCROUNGE AROUND FOR IT.
YOU1000000147_S0000077	THAT'S WHEN THEY MADE AN UNUSUAL DISCOVERY. CIVET CATS WOULD EAT COFFEE CHERRIES AND POOP OUT THE SEEDS, OR COFFEE BEANS, WITHOUT DIGESTING THEM.
YOU1000000147_S0000078	AFTER BREWING COFFEE FROM THE DISCARDED BEANS, THEY REALIZED IT TASTED GREAT TOO, MOSTLY BECAUSE THE CIVETS PICKED ONLY THE RIPEST CHERRIES.
YOU1000000147_S0000079	THE TRADITION CONTINUED AND NOWADAYS VENDORS OF AUTHENTIC KOPI LUWAK COFFEE CAN COMMAND ANYWHERE BETWEEN $250 TO 1,200 PER KILOGRAM.
YOU1000000147_S0000080	THERE ARE SOME CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE UNCONVENTIONAL BEVERAGE THOUGH. PRIMARILY, CIVET CATS ARE NOCTURNAL AND DON'T HAVE BIG APPETITES.
YOU1000000147_S0000081	WHICH MEANS MORE THAN 80% OF KOPI LUWAK COFFEE SOLD IN THE US HAS NEVER ACTUALLY PASSED THROUGH ONE.
YOU1000000147_S0000082	ATTEMPTS TO INDUSTRIALIZE THE PROCESS ALSO MEANS MANY CIVET CATS ARE CAGED AND FORCE FED THE BERRIES ROUND THE CLOCK, WHICH RESULTS IN CRAPPY COFFEE MADE BY VERY CRAPPY PEOPLE.
YOU1000000147_S0000083	DENSUKE BLACK WATERMELON.
YOU1000000147_S0000084	AFTER A MEAL AS RICH AS THE ONE I'VE JUST LAID OUT, A FRESH FRUIT SALAD IS ABOUT AS MUCH DESSERT AS YOU COULD MANAGE.
YOU1000000147_S0000085	THIS WON'T BE ANY OLD FRUIT THOUGH, DUH. FIRST UP, THE DENSUKI BLACK WATERMELON.
YOU1000000147_S0000086	THESE RARE MELONS ARE EXCLUSIVELY GROWN ON THE NORTHERN ISLAND OF HOKKAIDO IN JAPAN IN ANNUAL QUANTITIES OF ABOUT 10,000 UNITS.
YOU1000000147_S0000087	BESIDES THEIR INTRIGUINGLY DARK OUTER APPEARANCE, THEY'RE SAID TO HAVE CRISPER FLESH, MORE JUICE, AND AN ENHANCED SWEETNESS COMPARED TO THEIR OVERSEAS RELATIVES.
YOU1000000147_S0000088	THERE'S A LUCRATIVE MARKET FOR DECORATIVE FRUIT IN JAPAN, SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR DENSUKIS TO BE PURCHASED AS EXPENSIVE GIFTS.
YOU1000000147_S0000089	DEPENDING ON THE SIZE, THEY USUALLY GO FOR UPWARDS OF $250, BUT IN 2008, ONE FINE SPECIMEN EVEN SOLD FOR $6,100.
YOU1000000147_S0000090	YUBARI KING MELON
YOU1000000147_S0000091	EVEN THE DENSUKE IS A BARGAIN COMPARED TO JAPAN'S MOST HIGHLY PRICED MELON, THE YUBARI KING.
YOU1000000147_S0000092	WHICH IS BASICALLY A CROSS BETWEEN TWO CANTALOUPES.
YOU1000000147_S0000093	THIS ESTEEMED FRUIT IS ALSO EXCLUSIVELY GROWN ON HOKKAIDO ISLAND AND IS A MAJOR STATUS SYMBOL FOR ANYONE WITH ENOUGH
YOU1000000147_S0000095	SPARE DOUGH TO ADD ONE TO THEIR COLLECTION.
YOU1000000147_S0000096	IN SPRING 2016, SUPERMARKET OWNER TAKAMURA KUNISHI HIT THE HEADLINES AFTER HE POCKETED A PAIR OF YUBARI KINGS FOR THE EYE POPPING PRICE OF $27,240.
YOU1000000147_S0000097	MAKING THEM THE MOST EXPENSIVE MELONS EVER SOLD. BUT WHAT DOES ONE OF THESE PREMIUM FRUITS TASTE OF? A GOLD BULLION? APPARENTLY, THEY JUST HAVE AN ULTRA CONCENTRATED SWEETNESS.
YOU1000000147_S0000098	KUNISHI SAID HE OFFERED SUCH A FEE FOR THE MELONS TO PAY BACK THE HARD WORK OF THE YUBARI FARMERS.
YOU1000000147_S0000099	BUT EVEN A LESS COVETED BUYER CAN STILL EXPECT TO PAY THOUSANDS AT AUCTION. JAPAN'S LUXURY FRUIT MARKET ISN'T JUST EXCLUSIVE TO MELONS.
YOU1000000147_S0000100	AND IN 2019, TAKAMARU KANISHI RAISED EYEBROWS AGAIN AFTER PAYING $11,318 FOR A BUNCH OF RUBY ROMAN GRAPES.
YOU1000000147_S0000101	WHICH WORKED OUT AT AROUND $370 PER GRAPE.
YOU1000000147_S0000102	THIS RARE VARIETY IS LAUDED FOR ITS JUICINESS, HIGH SUGAR CONTENT, AND LOW ACIDITY. OH, AND DID I MENTION THEY'RE ABOUT THE SIZE OF PING PONG BALLS THANKS TO YEARS OF SELECTIVE BREEDING?
YOU1000000147_S0000103	WHEN THEY FIRST HIT THE MARKET IN 2008, 700 GRAM RUBY ROMAN BUNCHES SOLD FOR AROUND $910, AND THEIR PRICES ONLY SKYROCKETED SINCE.
YOU1000000147_S0000104	DONKEY CHEESE
YOU1000000147_S0000105	A CHEESE COURSE IS THE PERFECT WAY TO COMPLETE A MEAL, BUT FOR A BANQUET LIKE THIS ONE, PLAIN OLD CHEDDAR JUST WON'T CUT IT.
YOU1000000147_S0000106	BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE'S SUCH A THING AS DONKEY CHEESE, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PULE, AND IT'LL COST YOU A PRETTY PENNY.
YOU1000000147_S0000107	THIS BIZARRE CREATION IS ONLY PRODUCED BY FARMER SLOBODAN SIMIC ON HIS RURAL FARM IN SERBIA WITH THE HELP OF SOME 300 DONKEYS FROM THE ZASAVICA NATURE RESERVE.
YOU1000000147_S0000108	IT'S ESTEEMED FOR ITS SUPPOSED HEALTHY BENEFITS, WITH CLAIMS THAT IT'S HIGH IN PROTEIN, CALCIUM AND OMEGA 3 FATTY ACIDS.
YOU1000000147_S0000109	GETTING MILK FROM THE DOCKIES ISN'T EASY BECAUSE ONLY ABOUT 20 ANIMALS PRODUCE IT AT ONE TIME.
YOU1000000147_S0000110	AND IT TAKES SEVERAL GALLONS OF MILK TO MAKE ONE POUND OF CHEESE.
YOU1000000147_S0000111	THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR MILK DOESN'T CONTAIN ENOUGH CASEIN, THE CHARACTERISTIC THAT THICKENS IT INTO CURD, TO MAKE THE CHEESE THE TRADITIONAL WAY.
YOU1000000147_S0000112	THANKFULLY, SIMIC HAS A SECRET METHOD TO MAKE THE CHEESE, BUT IT COMES AT A PRICE.
YOU1000000147_S0000113	EACH KILO SELLS FOR ABOUT $1,110. THAT'S A LOT TO PAY FOR LITERAL ASS CHEESE.
YOU1000000147_S0000114	DON'T YOU THINK? WHICH OF THESE PREMIUM INGREDIENTS WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO TRY? LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENTS AND THANKS FOR WATCHING.
YOU1000000148_S0000000	HI VOGUE, THIS IS CARLA BRUNI AND TODAY I'LL BE LOOKING THROUGH MY LIFE IN LOOKS.
YOU1000000148_S0000002	ALL RIGHT, THIS MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST SHOW I DID FOR CHANEL. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH KARL BASICALLY UNTIL HE LEFT US LAST YEAR. AND THE FUNNY THING ABOUT KARL IS THAT HE WAS ALWAYS SO LATE.
YOU1000000148_S0000003	THAT SOMEHOW I'M ACTUALLY WONDERING IF HE'S REALLY PASSED AWAY OR MAYBE IF HE'S JUST LATE AND HE MIGHT ARRIVE.
YOU1000000148_S0000004	FASHION WAS ALWAYS GOING BACK TO SOURCES THAT WOULD BE A FEW DECADES EARLIER. THE HAIR AND THE MAKEUP AND ALSO THE LOOK OF THE OUTFIT, STILL FROM THE 80S, I WOULD SAY.
YOU1000000148_S0000006	AH, VOILA. HERE'S GIANNI, VERSACE, NAOMI, CAMPBELL, AND MYSELF. I'M WEARING A CATSUIT, A VERY SORT OF SPLENDID, GORGEOUS, PRINTED CATSUIT. AND NAOMI IS WEARING, I GUESS,
YOU1000000148_S0000007	THE SAME TYPE OF PRINT THAT I'M WEARING, BUT SHE IS WEARING A DRESS. VERSACE'S STYLE WAS EXTREMELY AUDACIOUS, YOU KNOW?
YOU1000000148_S0000008	IT WAS NOT ABOUT BEING CLASSIC. IT WAS ABOUT BEING STRONG, SEXY, AND EVEN A LITTLE TRANSGRESSIVE.
YOU1000000148_S0000009	THIS PICTURE ALMOST MAKES ME SAD. THINKING THAT GIANNI IS GONE IS STILL A SHOCK. HE WAS LIKE A SORT OF A, YOU KNOW, LOVELY FATHER TO US.
YOU1000000148_S0000011	OH MY GOD, HERE I AM AS A BRIDE AT GIVENCHY!
YOU1000000148_S0000013	IT'S A PLEASURE ALWAYS TO BE THE BRIDE IN A SHOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY STILL DO THAT TODAY.
YOU1000000148_S0000014	BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS A PLEASURE BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE THE CLOTHES, YOU KNOW, THE SORT OF THE CHERRY ON THE CAKE. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WANTS TO BE DRESSED AS A BRIDE ONCE IN A WHILE. I WOULD LOOK LIKE AN EASTER EGG IF I WAS WEARING THIS NOW, YOU KNOW?
YOU1000000148_S0000015	NOW, IT'S TOO LATE. BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS SORT OF FRESH AND ROMANTIC, RIGHT? HUBERT DE GIVENCHY WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE DESIGNER, BUT ALSO SUCH A GENTLEMAN. IT WAS SUCH A PLEASURE TO BE ONE OF HIS GIRLS, YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000148_S0000016	NEXT LOOK. SO HERE IT'S ME WITH MIU CIAPRADA, OBVIOUSLY AT A FITTING. I ALWAYS LOVED HER BRAND, I LIKE WHAT SHE DOES, I LIKE WHAT SHE CREATES.
YOU1000000148_S0000017	SHE'S A VERY DELICATE, LAID BACK PERSON. WHEN I WAS MODELING, WE WERE DOING HOURS OF FITTINGS FOR EACH DESIGNER. YOU GET TO SEE THE CLOTHES VERY EARLY.
YOU1000000148_S0000018	AND ALSO YOU SEE HOW MUCH WORK THERE IS TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN AND TO MAKE SOMETHING BECOME A DRESS OR A SUIT OR A COAT.
YOU1000000148_S0000019	I LIKE THIS PICTURE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A RAYS OF SUN. BOTH MEWCHA AND ME ARE VERY YOUNG. NICE.
YOU1000000148_S0000021	WELL, THIS IS VERSACE AGAIN. THIS IS VERSACE COUTURE, JUST AFTER THE SHOW AT THE HOTEL RITZ. I THINK THERE WAS A DINNER AFTER THIS SHOW. I REMEMBER THAT DRESS.
YOU1000000148_S0000022	BUT WE USED TO DO MAYBE 20 SHOWS PER SEASON AND PER COUNTRY. SO AT THE END OF IT, FOUR TIMES A YEAR, THERE WAS NO MEDIUM SHOWS, BUT THERE WAS COUTURE SHOWS ALSO. OH MY GOD.
YOU1000000148_S0000023	A LOT OF WALK. FASHION WEEK WAS CRAZY, IT WAS ECLECTIC. WE WOULD RUN ALL THE TIME, SLEEP VERY LITTLE, EAT VERY LITTLE. ALWAYS RUNNING IN A CAR FROM A SHOW TO ANOTHER.
YOU1000000148_S0000024	YOU KNOW, IT WAS SO MUCH FUN, BUT SO MUCH WORK. THIS IS 1986, PROMOTING KODAK SHOOTING IN LONDON. AND THE DRESS ACTUALLY HAS SOMETHING PARTICULAR, YOU KNOW, IT HAS PICTURES ALL OVER IT OF MYSELF.
YOU1000000148_S0000025	ISN'T THIS EMBARRASSING? WOULD YOU WEAR A DRESS WITH PICTURES OF YOURSELF ON? THIS IS SO FUNNY, REALLY. I WONDER WHERE THIS DRESS IS AND MAYBE WE CAN GET IT BACK.
YOU1000000148_S0000026	NOT REALLY TO WEAR IT, BUT JUST TO HAVE IT. ALSO, IT MAKES ME THINK THAT WE USED TO WORK ARGENTIQUE. YOU COULDN'T RETOUCH IT VERY EASILY, SO YOU HAD TO DO A VERY GOOD LIGHT. EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT THE HAIR AND THE MAKEUP AND THE LIGHT.
YOU1000000148_S0000027	AND SO WE COULDN'T GO BACK IN A COMPUTER AND FIX IT. PICTURES WAS WHAT IT WAS. AND THAT WAS THE NICE PART ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE CREATIVE PROCESS WAS ALWAYS GOING TOWARDS AS MUCH PERFECTION AS WE COULD.
YOU1000000148_S0000028	BECAUSE THEN THAT WAS IT, WE COULDN'T DO MUCH. RETOUCHES WERE VERY HARD TO DO. OKAY, SO THIS IS NOT A LOOK. IT'S A T SHIRT.
YOU1000000148_S0000030	THIS IS THE COVER OF MY FIRST ALBUM. I WAS ACTUALLY WEARING, YES, A T SHIRT AND JEANS, I WOULD SAY. BUT OF COURSE, THIS PICTURE IS FROM KATE BARRY, VERY TALENTED FRENCH PHOTOGRAPHER.
YOU1000000148_S0000031	THIS PICTURE IS ABOUT SIMPLICITY. THERE'S ALMOST NO MAKEUP, NO HAIR. I'M LAYING DOWN WITH MY GUITAR. THERE'S SOMETHING VERY PURE AND SIMPLE ABOUT THE PICTURE, RIGHT?
YOU1000000148_S0000032	I MADE THIS PICTURE FOR MY ALBUM AS FAR AS I COULD FROM SOPHISTICATED WORLD BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE ANOTHER MESSAGE WHICH WAS THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE ABOUT THE MUSIC.
YOU1000000148_S0000033	YOU KNOW, I HAD SUCH A STRONG IMAGE COMING FROM MODELING THAT I HAD TO TRY TO CUT IT OFF, YOU KNOW, AND TO SHOW SOMETHING OF MYSELF THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MAKEUP AND WITH BEING GLAMOROUS.
YOU1000000148_S0000034	YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT A GLAMOROUS PICTURE, BUT I THINK HE HELPED THE ALBUM TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS A SONGWRITER AND NOT A MODEL ANYMORE.
YOU1000000148_S0000037	THIS IS THE WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES 2006 IN TORINO, WHICH IS THE CITY I WAS BORN. I WAS SO HONORED WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO HOLD THE FLAG.
YOU1000000148_S0000038	AND I'M WEARING A DRESS DESIGNED BY ARMANI, AND I HAD TO CROSS THE WHOLE STADIUM. IT WAS FREEZING COLD, AND THIS IS A DRESS ENTIRELY MADE OF GLASS AND METAL, YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000148_S0000039	SO IT'S LIKE A SORT OF MATERIAL THAT THE KNIVES WOULD WEAR IN THE MIDDLE AGE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S ALL MADE OF METAL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING VERY METAL. IT WAS VERY HEAVY.
YOU1000000148_S0000040	AND UNDER THIS DRESS, I WAS WEARING LIKE PANTS AND SHIRT BECAUSE IT WAS SO COLD. IT WAS THE WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES AND IT WAS OUTSIDE, BUT SO COLD.
YOU1000000148_S0000041	SO I WAS ACTUALLY HAPPY TO WEAR SUCH A HEAVY DRESS AND TO BE ABLE TO WEAR PROPER WOOL, YOU KNOW, MOUNTAIN UNDERWEAR.
YOU1000000148_S0000043	ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS MICHELLE OBAMA AND MYSELF. I THINK WE'RE IN STRASBOURG. SHE'S ONE OF THE NICEST PERSON I'VE MET, YOU KNOW, IN THAT TIME, IN THAT WORLD. SHE'S A VERY WARM PERSON, VERY KIND.
YOU1000000148_S0000044	AND VERY BRIGHT. SHE DID SOMETHING ADORABLE DURING THAT TRIP. SHE CAME FROM AMERICA, SO YOU KNOW, THE USAGE IS TO GIVE A PRESENT TO THE OTHER FIRST LADY.
YOU1000000148_S0000045	AND SO SHE OFFERED ME A GUITAR, A GIBSON GUITAR. SO THAT WAS THE BEST PRESENT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD ACTUALLY THINK OF ME PLAYING GUITAR WHEN I WAS AT THE ELYSEE PALACE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY SEES YOU ONLY LIKE A FIRST LADY AS IF YOU DID NOTHING BEFORE, RIGHT?
YOU1000000148_S0000046	SO WHEN I GOT A GUITAR AS A PRESENT, I TOOK IT AS A SIGN, YOU KNOW? SUCH A COOL THING TO DO.
YOU1000000148_S0000047	WHEN YOU BECAME FIRST LADY, HOW DID YOUR STYLE HAVE TO CHANGE?
YOU1000000148_S0000048	WELL, YOU KNOW, I THROW ALL THE LATEX AWAY. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
YOU1000000148_S0000050	ALL MY HOT PANTS, YOU KNOW, ARE OFF.
YOU1000000148_S0000052	WHEN I MARRIED MY HUSBAND, OF COURSE, IT WAS ABOUT ALSO HONORING FRANCE.
YOU1000000148_S0000053	YOU KNOW, WITH THE STYLE. I CHOOSE TO WEAR ONLY FRENCH DESIGNERS, NOT ONLY TO PROMOTE, YOU KNOW, FRENCH FASHION THAT DOESN'T REALLY NEED IT.
YOU1000000148_S0000054	BUT BECAUSE IT GIVES PRIDE TO FRENCH PEOPLE TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH STANDARD OF QUALITY AND OF SAVOIR FAIRE. OH, WHAT A LOOK.
YOU1000000148_S0000055	SO THIS IS A VIDEO CLIP FROM JEAN BAPTISTE MONDINO, AND IT'S A SONG THAT I MADE A COVER OF IN THIS ALBUM I MADE WITH DAVID FOSTER. SO IT'S A ROLLING STONES SONG CALLED, MISS YOU.
YOU1000000148_S0000056	AND THIS WAS THE VIDEO THAT I MADE WITH JEAN BAPTISTE. IT LOOKS VERY DARK, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY SENSUAL VIDEO THAT HAS SORT OF SLOW MOTION IN IT. THE LOOK WAS A CATSUIT, A VERY SIMPLE BLACK CATSUIT.
YOU1000000148_S0000057	THE VIDEO WAS MADE BY MYSELF AND A DOUBLE OF MYSELF. IT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING VIDEO. IT'S A VERY INTERESTING VIDEO, VERY SIMPLE, BUT SEXY AND SORT OF SLOW MOTION.
YOU1000000148_S0000058	OKAY, THIS IS SEPTEMBER 2017, THE JENNIFER SATCHEZ TRIBUTE SHOW. SOME OF THE GIRLS I GET TO SEE OFTEN, YOU KNOW, I NEVER LOST TOUCH WITH NAOMI AND HELENA CHRISTENSEN. SOMETIMES I SEND MESSAGE TO CINDY.
YOU1000000148_S0000059	BUT I HADN'T SEEN CLAUDIA FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS OR SIX YEARS. AND JUST BEFORE THIS SHOW, WE MET ON A BEACH ON CORSICA. SO I'M SEEING THIS GIRL ON THE BEACH AND I'M LIKE, THIS IS CLAUDIA. SO I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE SAID TO ME,
YOU1000000148_S0000060	I MEAN, WE ALMOST SAID IT AT THE SAME TIME. ARE YOU DOING THE RESEARCH?
YOU1000000148_S0000062	I'M SO HAPPY THAT DONATELLA HAD THAT IDEA. IT WAS SO MOVING FOR US.
YOU1000000148_S0000063	AND SO EMOTIONAL REALLY. AND THIS DRESS WAS A DRESS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE I WORE 25 OR 30 YEARS BEFORE. IT WAS THAT DRESS BUT SHORT.
YOU1000000148_S0000064	2019, THIS IS THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL. AND THIS IS A DRESS BY MY FRIEND HEDI SLIMANE FOR CÉLINE. I LIKE THE COLOR OF THE DRESS. I LIKE THE SORT OF NAVY BLUE.
YOU1000000148_S0000065	RED CARPET ARE A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT. I DON'T DO IT OFTEN. WHEN I DO IT, I THINK IT'S QUITE GOOD FUN. THIS LOOKS QUITE SOBER, I WOULD SAY.
YOU1000000148_S0000066	COMPARED TO SOME OF THE LOOKS YOU GET TO SEE IN A CANNES FILM FESTIVAL, WHICH IS THE TRADITION, YOU KNOW? SO IT'S GREAT, IT'S GLAMOROUS. YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING I WOULDN'T DO ON A RED CARPET IS WEARING A RED DRESS, BUT NO ONE EVER DOES THAT.
YOU1000000148_S0000068	OTHERWISE YOU DISAPPEAR, RIGHT?
YOU1000000148_S0000070	YEAH, I DO LIKE ADI'S WORK, I MUST SAY, SINCE THE BEGINNING. I LIKED IT EVEN WHEN HE WAS DESIGNING CLOTHING FOR MEN. I WOULD WEAR HIS COSTUME THAT HE DESIGNED A FEW YEARS AGO FOR CHRISTIAN DIOR MEN.
YOU1000000148_S0000071	THEY WERE VERY, VERY NARROW ANYWAY. A GIRL COULD WEAR THEM. I LIKE THE WOMAN THAT HE PROJECT, THIS SORT OF ETERNAL YOUNG ADOLESCENT WOMAN, VERY NATURAL.
YOU1000000148_S0000072	SO THIS IS MY HOUSE.
YOU1000000148_S0000074	NOW THIS IS THE COVER OF MY LAST ALBUM THAT HAS NO TITLE, IT ONLY HAS MY NAME.
YOU1000000148_S0000076	AND MYSELF DID THE PICTURES SITTING OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WEARING CELINE JEANS.
YOU1000000148_S0000078	MY GUITAR. WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE A VERY TIMELESS FEELING WITH THIS ALBUM COVER. WHEN I'M IN MY REAL LIFE, I'M BASICALLY ALWAYS VERY UNSOPHISTICATED.
YOU1000000148_S0000079	SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK OF MY MUSIC, I ALWAYS THINK OF UNSOPHISTICATED IMAGE.
YOU1000000148_S0000080	I BELIEVE IT'S NOT SO EASY TO BE SIMPLE. I BELIEVE IT'S COMPLICATED TO MAKE A SIMPLE IMAGE. VOGUE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED MY LIFE AND LOOK.
YOU1000000148_S0000082	AND SEE YOU SOON!
YOU1000000149_S0000001	HI, I'M EMMA CHAMBERLAIN AND I'M GOING TO BE TAKING YOU THROUGH MY EVERYDAY SKINCARE, MY EVERYDAY MAKEUP, AND MY EVERYDAY HAIR. I JUST CHANGED THE COLOR OF IT, SO THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND, YOU KNOW, IT DESERVES A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT.
YOU1000000149_S0000002	AND MY DREAM IS COMING TRUE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO ONE OF THESE, SO... LET'S DO IT! OKAY, SO STEP ONE. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE NEAREST HEADBAND I HAVE AND PUT IT ON.
YOU1000000149_S0000004	HYDRATING FACE MASK.
YOU1000000149_S0000005	I DO THIS PROBABLY THREE TIMES A WEEK, FOUR TIMES A WEEK. I'M HONESTLY KIND OF SOMEBODY WHO JUST FOLLOWS MY INSTINCT. IF I FEEL LIKE MY SKIN IS DRY, I'LL DO A HYDRATING SKIN MASK. IF I FEEL LIKE MY SKIN IS GROSS,
YOU1000000149_S0000006	I'LL DO SOME SORT OF DETOXIFYING SKIN MASK. I JUST, I'M INTUITIVE WITH THE WHOLE THING.
YOU1000000149_S0000008	I'VE HAD ON AND OFF ACNE MY WHOLE LIFE, WELL SINCE LIKE PUBERTY.
YOU1000000149_S0000009	BUT MY SKIN GOT REALLY BAD IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN IT GOT BAD AGAIN AS LIKE AN OLDER TEEN.
YOU1000000149_S0000010	AND SO I DECIDED I WOULD GO ON ACCUTANE, WHICH IS A VERY INTENSE ACNE MEDICATION. I DID THAT FOR SEVEN MONTHS LAST YEAR.
YOU1000000149_S0000011	AND MY ACNE WENT AWAY.
YOU1000000149_S0000012	BUT I STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN MY SKIN. IT ACTUALLY MADE ME FALL IN LOVE WITH SKINCARE IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. ANYWAY, I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS ON FOR 10 MINUTES.
YOU1000000149_S0000014	THIS IS A VERY CRUCIAL PART OF MY MORNING ROUTINE. I HAVE A REALLY LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY ACNE JOURNEY, AND THERE WAS GOOD AND BAD MOMENTS.
YOU1000000149_S0000015	BUT Y'ALL SAW ALL OF IT. YOU CAN GO BACK AND SEE ANY OF IT. IT'S BEEN 10 MINUTES. I'M WASHING THIS OFF.
YOU1000000149_S0000017	NOW I LOOK LIKE A NEWBORN. OH MY GOD, MY EYEBROWS. MY EYEBROWS ARE VERY NEGLECTED, GUYS. PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME A HARD TIME. I...
YOU1000000149_S0000019	I REALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING TO THEM.
YOU1000000149_S0000021	BUT MOVING ON. FIRST, WE HAVE THIS SERUM THAT HAS SOME SORT OF SNAIL. I MEAN, ACCORDING TO THIS, IT'S SUPPOSED TO... OH MY GOD, IT...
YOU1000000149_S0000022	THIS IS GOING TO PREVENT WRINKLES. THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I'M STARTING TO WORRY ABOUT. ANYWAY, I DROP A LITTLE BIT INTO MY HAND.
YOU1000000149_S0000024	I'VE ALWAYS LIKED
YOU1000000149_S0000026	PUTTING IT IN MY HANDS MORE THAN PUTTING IT DIRECTLY ON MY FACE. I FEEL LIKE IT ALWAYS JUST LIKE FALLS OFF. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS SEE PEOPLE ON LIKE TIKTOK AND STUFF GOING LIKE THIS.
YOU1000000149_S0000027	I'M LIKE, MINE JUST GOES STRAIGHT ONTO MY SHIRT WHEN I TRY TO DO THAT.
YOU1000000149_S0000028	AND I'LL UNDERSTAND THEN I USE A TEA TREE RELIEF WHENEVER I HAVE A PIMPLE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND I LIVE WITH MY DAD
YOU1000000149_S0000030	HE WOULD TELL ME TO PUT TEA TREE OIL ON IT. AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID WHEN HE HAD ACNE.
YOU1000000149_S0000032	THANK YOU, DAD, FOR THE ACNE TIP. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY, IT WAS KIND OF NICE GROWING UP WITH PARENTS THAT ALSO HAD ACNE BECAUSE THEY KIND OF FELT MY PAIN.
YOU1000000149_S0000033	IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY, SO I FELT LIKE I HAD THE SUPPORT SYSTEM OF PARENTS THAT WERE LIKE, WE GET IT. NEXT I'M USING
YOU1000000149_S0000035	IT'S SO FUNNY BECAUSE WITH SKINCARE I'M VERY INTERESTED IN IT ESPECIALLY RECENTLY AND ESPECIALLY SINCE I GOT OFF ACCUTANE BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU1000000149_S0000036	I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ACNE AGAIN, SO I NEED TO REALLY WORK ON MAINTAINING MY SKIN AND KEEPING IT AS HEALTHY AND HAPPY AS I POSSIBLY CAN.
YOU1000000149_S0000037	THE CRAZY THING ABOUT SKINCARE THAT I'VE REALIZED IS IT IS SO DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY. I'VE TRIED HUNDREDS OF PRODUCTS.
YOU1000000149_S0000038	I'M CONSTANTLY SWITCHING IT UP. I'M CONSTANTLY TRYING NEW THINGS. THIS IS LITERALLY MY FAVORITE PRODUCT. THIS MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A BABY'S BUTT ON MY FACE. IT'S A HEMP OIL. IT'S UNREAL.
YOU1000000149_S0000040	WHEN I WAKE UP, I LOOK LIKE A VAMPIRE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I FEEL LIKE WHILE I'M SLEEPING, I JUST LOSE ALL OF MY LIFE IN MY FACE AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
YOU1000000149_S0000041	THIS PRODUCT TRULY BRINGS THE LIFE BACK TO MY SKIN. I ALSO TRY TO AVOID DAIRY, NOT ONLY FOR MY EXTREMELY DISGUSTINGLY SENSITIVE STOMACH.
YOU1000000149_S0000042	BUT ALSO BECAUSE I THINK THAT DAIRY DOES MAKE ME BREAK OUT ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T AND THEN I'M LIKE, OH
YOU1000000149_S0000043	OKAY, SO I CAN PUT UNHEALTHY AMOUNTS OF PARMESAN CHEESE ON EVERYTHING THAT I'M EATING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. LAST STEP OF MY SKINCARE ROUTINE.

YOU1000000149_S0000050	WHATEVER, IT ADDS PERSONALITY. LIP BALM. THIS IS HUGE.
YOU1000000149_S0000052	I'M LIKE KIND OF ADDICTED TO LIP BALM AND I HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS. LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE A LIP BALM ON ME AND IF I DON'T
YOU1000000149_S0000053	I'M BEGGING SOMEONE TO LET ME BORROW THEIRS, WHICH ACTUALLY IS NOT ALLOWED ANYMORE.
YOU1000000149_S0000054	AND NEVER WILL BE AGAIN. IT'S CRAZY THAT I EVER DID THAT. NOW I CAN RETROSPECT. THAT REALLY IS SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT. IT'S MAKEUP TIME.
YOU1000000149_S0000055	I AM A HUGE FAN OF A LIGHT MAKEUP. THIS IS A TINTED FACE OIL, LIFE CHANGING. IT BASICALLY ACTS AS A SUPER LIGHT FOUNDATION ISH TYPE OF THING.
YOU1000000149_S0000056	SO I PUT A LITTLE BIT ON MY HANDS, I RUB IT AND I JUST LITERALLY LIKE LIGHTLY
YOU1000000149_S0000058	RUB IT IN.
YOU1000000149_S0000060	BUT IT'S LIKE SO NICE AND LIGHT.
YOU1000000149_S0000062	I STARTED WEARING MAKEUP PROBABLY EIGHTH GRADE SLASH FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE I BECAME A CHEERLEADER COMPETITIVELY.
YOU1000000149_S0000063	AND WE HAD TO DO CRAZY HAIR AND MAKEUP AND I JUST ENDED UP GETTING KIND OF DECENT AT IT THEN
YOU1000000149_S0000064	WHEN IT CAME TO DAY TO DAY WEAR, I NEVER WAS HUGE INTO IT UP UNTIL RECENTLY.
YOU1000000149_S0000065	LET'S REALLY MAKE SURE WE'RE LOOKING OKAY HERE. SEE HOW NICE AND LIGHT IT IS THOUGH ON YOUR SKIN? IT MAKES YOU LOOK GLOWY AND LIKE IT'S AN AMAZING PRODUCT.
YOU1000000149_S0000066	CONCEALER. I'M ALWAYS TRYING OUT NEW CONCEALERS BECAUSE THESE UNDER EYE BAGS ARE NOT
YOU1000000149_S0000068	GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON. THEY ARE IN FACT GENETIC.
YOU1000000149_S0000069	IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE ON TIKTOK DRAW ON UNDER EYE BAGS OR UNDER EYE DARK CIRCLES.
YOU1000000149_S0000070	WITH LIKE DARK EYESHADOW AND I'M LIKE WAIT A MINUTE UNDER EYE BAGS ARE TRENDING NOW UNDER EYE CIRCLES ARE TRENDING NOW COUNT ME IN
YOU1000000149_S0000072	I LIKE TO PUT THIS IN WITH MY FINGERS. I NEVER, I USED TO USE A SPONGE BUT I FIND THAT IT LOOKS MORE DEWY AND NATURAL IF I USE MY FINGER.
YOU1000000149_S0000074	I ALSO LIKE TO PUT THE EXCESS PRODUCTS THAT ARE ON MY FINGERS ON MY EYELIDS. IT JUST CREATES LIKE A NICE LIGHT BASE FOR THE THINGS THAT GO THERE NEXT.
YOU1000000149_S0000075	I USE POWDER EARLY IN MY ROUTINE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT JUST PREVENTS FROM ANY CREASING IN MY FACE OF WHATEVER IS GOING ON HERE.
YOU1000000149_S0000077	LET'S NOT COMMENT ON MY BRUSH USAGE.
YOU1000000149_S0000078	BECAUSE I LITERALLY JUST CHOOSE WHATEVER BRUSH I FEEL LIKE WOULD WORK BEST FOR WHAT I'M DOING. I THINK SETTING UNDER EYES, FOREHEAD.
YOU1000000149_S0000079	AND CHIN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART I'VE FOUND. AND UNDER MY NOSE ACTUALLY TOO.
YOU1000000149_S0000080	SO NOW WE HAVE A NICE BASE

YOU1000000149_S0000086	HI, LATER.
YOU1000000149_S0000088	THE THING I'VE LEARNED IS LESS IS MORE AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WATCH A TUTORIAL AND YOU REALIZE
YOU1000000149_S0000089	YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT THE WHOLE BOTTLE OF FOUNDATION ON YOUR HAND TO MAKE YOUR SKIN LOOK GOOD. YOU KNOW, IF ANYTHING IT'LL LOOK WORSE.
YOU1000000149_S0000091	I SHOUT OUT...
YOU1000000149_S0000093	OKAY.
YOU1000000149_S0000095	SOMETIMES I'LL ADD IN LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A COLOR LIKE THIS.
YOU1000000149_S0000097	INTO MY CREASE, BUT I MAKE SURE I DON'T OVERDO IT BECAUSE IT'S VERY EASY TO OVERDO IT.
YOU1000000149_S0000099	MY EYES CAN GET OVERPOWERED VERY EASILY, SO I ALWAYS TRY TO AVOID THAT AT ALL COSTS.
YOU1000000149_S0000101	I AM NOT A BIG EYELINER PERSON.
YOU1000000149_S0000102	SO I LIKE TO TAKE THIS KIND OF MEDIUM BROWN AND MAYBE MIX IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THIS BROWN.
YOU1000000149_S0000104	THIS SIDE IS JUST A NIGHTMARE FOR ME TRYING TO DO MY HAND.
YOU1000000149_S0000106	CAN YOU NOT?
YOU1000000149_S0000108	YOU WANNA SAY HI TO MY CAT? WHAT'S UP?
YOU1000000149_S0000110	OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK OUTSIDE.
YOU1000000149_S0000111	THAT'S FUN THOUGH, RIGHT? OKAY. IF YOU KEEP SCRATCHING ON THE DOOR THOUGH, YOU'RE GROUNDED. BACK TO WORK. BEING A CAT MOM IS NOT EASY.
YOU1000000149_S0000113	TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THIS.
YOU1000000149_S0000115	RUB IT IN BETWEEN MY FINGERS.
YOU1000000149_S0000116	I JUST KIND OF LIGHTLY TAP IT ON MY INNER CORNER. I FEEL LIKE THAT REALLY LIGHTENS MY EYES UP.
YOU1000000149_S0000118	LET'S TAKE A BROW GEL.
YOU1000000149_S0000120	KEEP THEM NICE AND FLUFFY AND NATURAL LOOKING.
YOU1000000149_S0000121	THEN I TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TINTED BROW GEL.
YOU1000000149_S0000123	THE NEXT FEW STEPS OF THIS ROUTINE IS JUST OUT OF ORDER, BUT THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE TO DO IT. SO BEAR WITH ME.
YOU1000000149_S0000125	I LIKE TO WIPE ALL THE EXCESS PRODUCT OFF MY LID.
YOU1000000149_S0000127	AND THEN I TAKE THIS PLUMPING LIP CREAM.
YOU1000000149_S0000129	AND I PUT THIS ON AND I LET IT SIT WHILE I DO THE REMAINDER OF MY LOOK SO THAT MY LIPS CAN KIND OF FLUFFEN UP.
YOU1000000149_S0000131	I THINK THAT I COULD USE SOME BLUSH.
YOU1000000149_S0000133	THIS IS THE ONLY BLUSH I LITERALLY OWN.
YOU1000000149_S0000135	I HATE THE WAY YOU HAVE TO SMILE WHEN YOU PUT ON BLUSH.
YOU1000000149_S0000136	CAN YOU GUYS LOOK AWAY FOR A SECOND WHILE I DO THIS?
YOU1000000149_S0000138	OH MY GOD, THIS EYELASH CURLER IS SO GROSS.
YOU1000000149_S0000140	BUT I'VE HAD IT FOR SO LONG. IT'S JUST THE ONLY ONE I'VE EVER FOUND THAT I LIKE.
YOU1000000149_S0000144	ALRIGHT, LET ME HAVE MY MASCARA. THAT LITERALLY IS THE COOLEST SHAPE. LOOK AT
YOU1000000149_S0000146	HOW FUN IS THAT?
YOU1000000149_S0000148	I LOVE THE LIGHT.

YOU1000000149_S0000152	AND I REALLY WANT TO PLAY INTO THAT THIS YEAR. 2021 IS THE TWIGGY LOWER LASH LINE YEAR.
YOU1000000149_S0000154	LIP LINER.
YOU1000000149_S0000156	I'VE ALWAYS NEGLECTED MY LIPS, BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY ACTUALLY PULL TOGETHER A FULL MAKEUP LOOK. I'VE RECENTLY LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE. SO HERE WE ARE.
YOU1000000149_S0000158	OH MY GOD, I'M DONE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU1000000149_S0000160	NOW WE NEED TO DO HAIR. I DID JUST GO BRUNETTE.
YOU1000000149_S0000162	WAS BLONDE FOR LIKE EIGHT MONTHS AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT BUT
YOU1000000149_S0000164	MY HAIR GOT EXTREMELY DAMAGED AND SO JUST A FEW DAYS AGO I CUT ALL OF IT OFF.
YOU1000000149_S0000165	AND DYE IT BROWN, DRY SHAMPOO, DAP. THIS ONE'S REALLY GOOD. THIS ONE HAS BEEN AMAZING, ESPECIALLY WITH BROWN HAIR, IT'S HARD TO USE DRY SHAMPOO BECAUSE IT REALLY JUST SHOWS UP.
YOU1000000149_S0000167	DRY SHAMPOO IS ALSO GREAT BECAUSE IT ADDS VOLUME. LIKE, WHY NOT, YOU KNOW?
YOU1000000149_S0000169	OKAY, I'M ALSO SOMEBODY THAT'S ALWAYS LOVED TO HAVE MY HAIR UP IN A PONYTAIL OR UP IN SOME WAY.
YOU1000000149_S0000170	AND NOW THAT MY HAIR IS LITERALLY THIS SHORT, I CAN'T DO THAT. SO I HAVE TO ADAPT.
YOU1000000149_S0000172	THE DRY SHAMPOO HONESTLY LIKE WEIRDLY STYLES IT ENOUGH TO A POINT WHERE I'M LIKE SATISFIED WITH IT BUT I DO LIKE TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF HAIRSPRAY.
YOU1000000149_S0000174	I WILL JUST DO ANYTHING FOR VOLUME.
YOU1000000149_S0000176	SEE, NOW IT LOOKS GOOD. BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE MY OWN FACE ON THE INTERNET EVERY SINGLE DAY, IT'S MADE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE OBSESSIVE ABOUT HOW I LOOK.
YOU1000000149_S0000177	BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S JUST ABOUT PRACTICING RESILIENCE AND REALIZING THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU1000000149_S0000178	HOPEFULLY PEOPLE AREN'T FOLLOWING ME BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT MY HAIR COLOR. HOPEFULLY THEY'RE FOLLOWING ME BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HANG OUT WITH ME. WHEN I START TO GET TWO IN MY HEAD, THE PHONE'S OFF.
YOU1000000149_S0000179	AND I'M PLAYING DRUMS, I'M HANGING OUT WITH MY ONE FRIEND, TALKING TO MY PARENTS ON THE PHONE. THAT FIXES EVERYTHING, I THINK.
YOU1000000149_S0000180	THIS IS THE FINAL LOOK. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. THANK YOU FOR HANGING OUT WITH ME. I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TODAY AND SEE YOU AROUND. BYE.
YOU1000000150_S0000000	THIS IS THE NEW BENTLEY CONTINENTAL GT. NOW THE OLD GUY HAD A BIT OF A REPUTATION FOR BEING DRIVEN BY PEOPLE WHO TENDED TO PLAY WITH THESE THINGS FOR A LIVING.
YOU1000000150_S0000002	ANYWAY, THIS NEW ONE, IT MAY END UP BEING THE SAME BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF MONEY AND HE WANTS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY COOL AND STYLISH AND FAST, YOU'RE GOING TO GO FOR THIS. NOW, I LOVE THE DESIGN OF THIS CAR, SO IT'S JUST SO COOL.
YOU1000000150_S0000003	THESE CREASES, THE CHROME DETAILING, THE WIDE HAUNCHES HERE AT THE BACK. NOW SOME PEOPLE WHO'VE SEEN IT SAY, WELL I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE REAR, BUT I LOVE IT. I LIKE THE WAY THESE LIGHTS MATCH THE EXHAUST AND IT'S JUST ALL KIND OF SLEEK AND SQUAT AND STRONG.
YOU1000000150_S0000004	THEN AT THE FRONT YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL GRILLE. THIS CAR IS STUNNING. THE GUY WHO DESIGNED THIS HAS CREATED A MASTERPIECE. IT'S, FOR ME, AS BEAUTIFUL AS ANY CONSTABLE. SO, YEAH.
YOU1000000150_S0000005	I'M NOT TALKING POLICEMAN, I'M TALKING ART. NOW, THIS CAR IS NOT CHEAP, IT STARTS FROM JUST UNDER £160,000. IF YOU KNOW OF ANYONE WHO'S LOOKING TO BUY A NEW CAR, CLICK ON THE POP OUT BAR IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE SCREEN OR ON THE LINK BELOW THE VIDEO
YOU1000000150_S0000006	BECAUSE YOU CAN REFER THEM TO CARWOW AND IF THEY BUY A CAR THROUGH US WE'LL GIVE YOU A 50 POUND AMAZON GIFT CARD.
YOU1000000150_S0000008	AS YOU'D IMAGINE, THE INSIDE OF THIS CAR IS JUST GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS. NOW, THE PARTICULAR CAR I'VE GOT HERE HAS GOT ALMOST £50,000 WORTH OF OPTIONS ON IT, AND £34,000 OF THAT
YOU1000000150_S0000009	IS THE FIRST EDITION SPECIFICATION, AND THAT'S SIGNIFIED BY THIS LITTLE NUMBER ONE WITH THE UNION JACK THERE UP ON THE DASH. SO IT INCLUDES STUFF LIKE THE MULLINER PACK, WHICH INCLUDES LIKE DIAMOND QUILTING. THE CAR ALSO HAS THE KNURLING ON THE AIR VENTS
YOU1000000150_S0000010	AND ON VARIOUS OTHER BITS AND PIECES SUCH AS THE LITTLE ORGAN STOPS. IT'S JUST FEEL QUALITY. I MEAN, EVERYTHING IS JUST LOVELY. THERE'S A METAL EFFECT FOR ALL THE SWITCHES AND THINGS LIKE THE DOOR HANDLES ARE ACTUALLY SOLID METAL. I LOVE IT IN HERE.
YOU1000000150_S0000011	I REALLY DO. THEN THERE'S ATTENTION TO DETAIL SUCH AS THE WAY THE VENTS MATCH UP TO THIS METAL STRIP THAT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CABIN. I MEAN, THAT IS REALLY PLEASING MY OCD. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY WOULDN'T. FOR INSTANCE, THE STITCHING UP ON HERE
YOU1000000150_S0000012	BUT IT DOES MEANDER A BIT. I CAN FORGIVE IT THOUGH, BECAUSE THIS IS HAND STITCHED. IF THIS WAS DONE BY A ROBOT I'D WANT IT DEAD STRAIGHT, BUT THE FACT THAT IT IS SLIGHTLY WONKY IS KIND OF
YOU1000000150_S0000013	LET'S YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN DONE BY A MAN. OBVIOUSLY IF IT'D BEEN A JAPANESE PERSON, THEY'D PROBABLY BEEN IT DEAD STRAIGHT, BUT THAT'S BRITISH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LIKE IN ENGLAND AND IT'S A BIT LIKE JOHN LENNON'S VOICE THE FACT THAT IT'S IMPERFECT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO PERFECT
YOU1000000150_S0000014	AND THE LEATHER QUALITY THROUGHOUT IS JUST LUSH. IT'S GOT A BOUTIQUE TAILORED FEEL TO IT. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THOUGH. SO YOU'VE GOT DIGITAL DIALS IN THIS CAR AND
YOU1000000150_S0000015	THEY'RE REALLY FUNCTIONAL AND I LIKE WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THEM. THEY LOOK ALMOST REAL, THE WAY THEY'VE GOT LIKE A 3D EFFECT. PART OF ME JUST WANTS OLD FASHIONED ANALOGUE DIALS.
YOU1000000150_S0000016	BUT THERE IS GREATER FUNCTIONALITY WITH THIS, SO YOU CAN DO THINGS LIKE LOOK AT THE SAT NAV, MAKE IT GO WIDESCREEN, CONNECT YOUR PHONE, LOOK THROUGH VARIOUS FUNCTIONS AND
YOU1000000150_S0000017	IT'S ALL GOOD AND THERE'S THE WIDESCREEN INFOTAINMENT DISPLAY WHICH IS OKAY TO USE. YOU CAN TELL IT'S BASED ON THE SYSTEM USED BY AUDI. FOR SOME REASON THEY'VE TRIED TO PERSONALISE IT, MAKE IT A BIT MORE BENTLEY BUT IT'S
YOU1000000150_S0000018	IT'S NOT AS EASY TO USE.
YOU1000000150_S0000019	THESE SWITCHES ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE A BIT LIKE THOSE YOU GET IN A GOLF. NOW JOURNALISTS MAY COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT IS SOMEONE WHO BUYS THIS CAR HAS NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR A GOLF, NOR THEIR FRIENDS. THE ONLY GOLF THEY KNOW IS PLAYED AT ST ANDREWS OR PEBBLE BEACH.
YOU1000000150_S0000020	SO IT'S FUNCTIONAL, IT WORKS, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AND IT DOESN'T FEEL CHEAP. IN FACT ALL THE SWITCHES WITH THE METAL EFFECT LIKE I SAY, IT'S JUST, GOSH IT'S LOVELY. SOME OF THE SWITCHES DOWN HERE, THEY'RE NICELY LAID OUT BUT THEY CAN BE A BIT CONFUSING TO USE WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING, BUT YOU CAN FEEL YOUR WAY ROUND THEM OKAY.
YOU1000000150_S0000021	AND THERE IS A DECENT AMOUNT OF STORAGE IN HERE. SO WE'VE GOT HUGE DOOR BINS, WHICH IS HANDY FOR YOUR BOTTLE OF WATER. DOWN HERE, THERE'S A SPECIAL STORAGE AREA, WHICH I IMAGINE COULD BE USED FOR YOUR CIGARS, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY CUBANS, SO I'M HAVING TO USE...
YOU1000000150_S0000023	TO ILLUSTRATE THAT. THERE IS A BIT OF STORAGE IN HERE BUT THE GLOVE BOX ISN'T THE LARGEST BUT IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN PUT YOUR EXPENSIVE LEATHER GLOVES IN THERE, THERE'S A BIT MORE STORAGE UNDER THERE AND THIS CAR ACTUALLY HAS A WIRELESS CHARGING POINT FOR YOUR MOBILE PHONE.
YOU1000000150_S0000024	AND THEN UNDER HERE THERE'S SOME REALLY DEEP CUP HOLDERS. I MEAN LOOK AT THAT, LOOK AT THE WAY THAT OPENS. I MEAN THE QUALITY IN HERE IS JUST IMPECCABLE. ALL THE WOOD JUST FEELS GREAT AND EVEN THE SPEAKER COVERS FOR THIS UPGRADED NAME AUDIO SYSTEM WHICH
YOU1000000150_S0000025	BY THE WAY, IS SO LOUD. THE BASS IS THUMPING, IT'S ALMOST LIKE THUNDER. IT'S SO GOOD. THAT FEELS GLORIOUS. EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH AND FEEL IS GLORIOUS. HOWEVER, WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR PEOPLE IN THE BACK? THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FOUR SEATER COUPE,
YOU1000000150_S0000026	SO, COME ON, YES THAT WILL SLIDE OUT THE WAY. GOOD. SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING MANUALLY IN THIS BENTLEY. ALSO THE DOOR
YOU1000000150_S0000027	THERE YOU GO, IT'S SOFT CLOSING. IT'S GOT THIS LITTLE SEAT BELT BUTLER THERE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACH FOR YOUR OWN BELT. NOW I'M JUST GOING TO PUT THIS SEAT BACK. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE REAR OF THIS CAR BEFORE. LET'S SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE. IS IT GOING TO CRUSH MY LEGS?
YOU1000000150_S0000029	I'VE GOT ENOUGH KNEE ROOM, THE FOOT SPACE IS A BIT TIGHT AND THE SEAT IS RATHER DEEP SO IT'S PRESSING AGAINST MY CALF. SO IT'S NOT THE MOST COMFY BACK HERE AND HEADROOM IS TIGHT AS WELL, THOUGH MY HEAD IS TOUCHING THIS BEAUTIFUL LEATHER ROOF LINING.
YOU1000000150_S0000030	I'VE GOT PRODUCT IN MY HAIR SO IT'S GOING TO END UP LEAVING STAIN ON THERE. THESE SEATS ARE GORGEOUS. YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN REAR WINDOWS AS WELL, WHICH IS NICE. THAT'S A BIT OF FRESH AIR IN. THERE'S SOME STORAGE AND CUP HOLDERS UNDER HERE. YOU'VE GOT 12 VOLT SOCKET, YOU'VE GOT
YOU1000000150_S0000031	CHARGING POINT FOR YOUR MOBILE PHONE. YOU'VE EVEN GOT SOME THROUGH LOADING IF YOU WANT TO CARRY SKIS IN THE BACK. LOOK AT THIS, IT'S A BIT UNUSUAL. I'VE NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE. NORMALLY THIS WOULD BE HINGED BUT YES, I COULD PROBABLY SELL THAT ON EBAY FOR ABOUT £500. NOW LET'S CHECK OUT
YOU1000000150_S0000032	THE BOOT. BECAUSE, YEAH, THIS IS QUITE A BIG CAR, BUT I DON'T RECKON IT'S GOT THE BIGGEST BOOT. I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S A SPORTY COUPE.
YOU1000000150_S0000034	BUT IT'S DECENT ENOUGH IN SIZE. YOU CAN FIT A LARGE SUITCASE AND THERE IS A BIT OF A LIP TO LIFT STUFF OVER, BUT TO STOP YOU SCRATCHING YOUR PAINTWORK, THERE IS A SCUFF PLATE HERE. I THINK IT MIGHT BE PLASTIC, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE METAL AND I'LL FORGIVE IT BECAUSE QUALITY IN THE BOOT HERE IS REALLY GOOD.
YOU1000000150_S0000035	BOOT, EVEN THE CARPETS HERE ARE THICK, ALMOST AS THICK AS IN THE FRONT. AND CHECK THIS OUT FOR THE 12V SOCKET, LOOK AT THAT, IT'S DAMPED. NOW THE THING WITH THIS BOOT IS THAT THEY'VE DESIGNED IT TO BE WIDE ENOUGH TO TAKE
YOU1000000150_S0000037	IT'S JUST A GOLF CLUBS LOOK. GOLF CLUBS.
YOU1000000150_S0000039	FIT QUITE EASILY.
YOU1000000150_S0000040	HOWEVER, THIS CAR ISN'T ALL PERFECT. HERE'S FIVE ANNOYING THINGS ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000150_S0000042	THIS STEERING WHEEL LOOKS SUPER LOVELY AND I REALLY LIKE THE LARGE BENTLEY LOGO. SEEMS POSH. SHAME THEN THAT THEY HAVE TO WRITE AIRBAG SO BIG BENEATH IT. AIRBAG!
YOU1000000150_S0000043	THE SURROUNDS FOR THESE PARKING SENSORS JUST LOOK AWFUL. THEY DON'T EVEN FIT PROPERLY. FOR SOME REASON YOU CAN'T GET THE BENTLEY CONTINENTAL GT WITH ANDROID AUTO. WHAT, IS THAT BECAUSE ANDROID PHONES AREN'T AS GOOD AS IPHONES? I THINK NOT BECAUSE THE NEW GALAXY
YOU1000000150_S0000044	S9 IS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN AN IPHONE X. DISCUSS IN THE COMMENTS BOX BELOW.
YOU1000000150_S0000045	WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING THE LIGHT REFLECTS IN THIS SHINY STRIP AND IT CATCHES THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE AND YOU ALWAYS THINK THERE'S ANOTHER VEHICLE JUST IN YOUR BLIND SPOT. DON'T WORRY THERE'S STILL PLENTY TO LIKE ABOUT THIS CAR. HERE'S THE CARWOW 5 COOL FEATURES. THE HEAD UP DISPLAY IS REALLY BIG
YOU1000000150_S0000046	AND BRIGHT AND VERY USEFUL WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING. YOU CAN SHOW THINGS LIKE THE DIRECTION FROM THE SATELLITE NAVIGATION, YOUR SPEED AND THE ACTUAL SPEED LIMIT. WHEN YOU PUT THE REAR SPOILER UP MANUALLY, IT SHOWS THAT YOU'VE DONE THAT ON A LITTLE GRAPHIC ON THE CAR'S DISPLAY, WHICH IS KIND OF COOL.
YOU1000000150_S0000047	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE LOOK OF THE LIGHTS. THEY'VE BEEN DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE DIAMONDS. MAYBE THEY'RE JUST SWAROVSKI CRYSTALS. THAT'S A BIT EASY. DEFINITELY DIAMONDS. DIGITAL DISPLAY A LITTLE BIT TOO MODERN FOR YOU.
YOU1000000150_S0000048	DON'T WORRY, YOU CAN TURN BACK TIME BY ROTATING THE SCREEN AROUND FOR SOME ANALOGUE DIALS. AND THEN WHEN YOU TURN THE CAR OFF, IT'LL ALL JUST FLIP AWAY
YOU1000000150_S0000050	AND REVEAL A NICE CLEAN WOODEN SURFACE.
YOU1000000150_S0000051	NOW IT'S TIME TO HIT THE ROAD TO SEE WHAT THIS CAR IS LIKE TO DRIVE.
YOU1000000150_S0000053	HOW FAST CAN A CAR WHICH WEIGHS 2.2 TONNES ACTUALLY BE? WELL, WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT BECAUSE I'VE GOT SOME SPECIAL TIMING EQUIPMENT UP THERE. I'M GOING TO LAUNCH THIS BENTLEY.
YOU1000000150_S0000055	CRIKEY!
YOU1000000150_S0000057	THIS IS NUTS. THIS IS VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY FAST.
YOU1000000150_S0000059	WHOA! WOW! WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW!
YOU1000000150_S0000061	I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO THE BRAKES FIRST OF ALL. I MEAN, THEY SLAMMED ON THE ANCHORS. THAT'S GOOD NEWS. THE BRAKES ARE GOOD. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE?
YOU1000000150_S0000063	0 60MPH IN 3.7 SECONDS.
YOU1000000150_S0000065	SO WHY IS THIS CAR SO BLUMMING QUICK? WELL, BECAUSE UNDERNEATH THE BONNET IS A 6.0 LITRE W12 TWIN TURBOCHARGED PETROL ENGINE WITH
YOU1000000150_S0000066	635 HORSEPOWER AND 900 NEWTON METRES OF TORQUE.
YOU1000000150_S0000067	AND I LOVE THIS ENGINE. IT IS SO POWERFUL. THERE'S SOMETHING ALMOST GEOLOGICAL TO IT IN THE WAY THAT IT'S RELENTLESS AND IT MAKES THE NOISE.
YOU1000000150_S0000069	OF AN ERUPTING VOLCANO. NOW THERE IS A SMALL MATTER OF ECONOMY IN EMISSIONS, WHICH IS NOT GREAT, BUT I'M AVERAGING 22MPG
YOU1000000150_S0000070	NOW THAT COULD BE QUITE EXPENSIVE, BUT IF YOU CAN AFFORD THIS CAR, YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS HOW FAR YOU CAN GO BETWEEN FUEL STOPS. AND THIS CAR HAS A BIG PETROL TANK, SO WITH THAT ECONOMY,
YOU1000000150_S0000072	I COULD GO ABOUT 450 MILES BETWEEN HAVING TO PULL UP AND RUB SHOULDERS WITH NORMAL PEOPLE AT A PETROL STATION. I CAN TWIST THE DIAL DOWN HERE AND PUT EVERYTHING IN COMFORT MODE AND IT SOFTENS OFF THE AIR SUSPENSION
YOU1000000150_S0000073	AND THEN THE THROTTLE RESPONSE MAKES THE STEERING A BIT LIGHTER. THE BEST MODE IS THE SPECIAL BENTLEY MODE WHICH IS THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS BETWEEN SPORTINESS AND COMFORT. AND YEAH, YOU CHUCK IT INTO A CORNER
YOU1000000150_S0000074	IT SOMEHOW GRIPS AND GOES ROUND. FOR INSTANCE, I'M ON A TWISTY ROAD NOW AND
YOU1000000150_S0000076	IT'S SURPRISINGLY GOOD. YOU SEE, THIS NEW CONTINENTAL GT SEEMS TO JUST CONTINUE JUST HOLDING ITS LINE, WHEREAS THE OLD ONE WOULD HAVE KIND OF JUST RUN OUT OF TALENT AND STARTED TO WOBBLE OFF THE ROAD. IT IS GENUINELY GOOD FUN WHEN YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY.
YOU1000000150_S0000077	TO THROW IT A POWER PIT!
YOU1000000150_S0000079	THAT'S A BIT WRONG DOING THIS. IT'S A BIT LIKE DRIVING THE BRITISH MUSEUM REALLY FAST DOWN A ROAD.
YOU1000000150_S0000081	YOU CAN DO WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE. THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM GRIPS AND GRIPS AND GRIPS.
YOU1000000150_S0000083	AND IT CAN SEND LOADS OF POWER TO THE BACK. I MEAN IT IS REAR DRIVE BIASED SO IT FEELS SPORTY.
YOU1000000150_S0000084	I MEAN, YEAH, IT'S NOT QUITE AS AGILE AS SOMETHING LIKE A FERRARI GTC4LUSSO, BUT I THINK IT'S NICER INSIDE. I COULD LIVE LIKE THIS. WHAT A CAR. ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT TO BE CRITICAL.
YOU1000000150_S0000085	THERE IS SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S THE REAR VISIBILITY WHICH IS KIND OF LETTERBOX LIKE. THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I DON'T LIKE?
YOU1000000150_S0000087	NOW IF YOU CLICK ON THE POP OUT BAR IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE SCREEN OR THE LINK BELOW THE VIDEO YOU CAN GO TO CARWOW.COM TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU CAN SAVE ON A NEW CAR. SO THEN WHAT'S MY FINAL VERDICT ON THE BENTLEY CONTINENTAL GT? SHOULD YOU AVOID IT? SHOULD YOU CONSIDER IT? SHOULD YOU SHORTLIST IT?
YOU1000000150_S0000088	OR SHOULD YOU JUST GO RIGHT AHEAD AND BUY IT? WELL, IF I WON THE LOTTERY, OR IF I WAS A FOOTBALL PLAYER, I'D BUY IT. I LOVE THIS CAR, I REALLY DO.

ALSO CLICK ON OUR LOGO TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS CHANNEL AND IF YOU CLICK ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER YOU CAN ACTUALLY WATCH MORE OF OUR CONTENT. MEANWHILE CLICK OVER TO THE RIGHT TO GO TO OUR DEALS PAGE TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU CAN SAVE ON A NEW CAR.
YOU1000000150_S0000092	NOW, DID YOU SPOT THE EASTER EGG IN THIS VIDEO? IT WAS THE CONTINENTAL CHOCOLATE IN THE CAR'S GLOVE BOX.
YOU1000000151_S0000001	THE FR S AND ITS SISTERS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION AS THE AFFORDABLE ENTHUSIAST REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR, THE DE FACTO STANDARD. HOWEVER, THE BRITISH PIONEERED THIS IDEA AND THE JAPANESE REFINED IT, SO WE BROUGHT ALONG
YOU1000000151_S0000003	2000 AND A MAZDA RX 8 TO FIND OUT IF THE FR S TRULY IS THE BEST EXAMPLE.
YOU1000000151_S0000004	AND THESE ARE THE TWO THAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR. I MEAN, WE'VE HAD SO MANY REQUESTS.
YOU1000000151_S0000006	AND I'M EXCITED TO DO IT, BUT I HAVE A LITTLE CONCERN I MAY HAVE DUG MYSELF A HOLE.
YOU1000000151_S0000007	WELL, SO WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU1000000151_S0000008	WELL, ON THE PCH PIECE, I MAY HAVE SAID THAT THE FRS WAS BETTER THAN THE PCH.
YOU1000000151_S0000010	I THINK YOU DID SAY THAT.
YOU1000000151_S0000011	I THINK I DID TOO. I THINK I REMEMBER THAT. SO NOW I AM PREPARED TO BE WRONG. WE HAVE THEM HERE. I'M PREPARED TO DRIVE THEM. I'M PREPARED TO BE WRONG.
YOU1000000151_S0000012	I THINK I'M GONNA BE WRONG TOO. I THINK I...
YOU1000000151_S0000013	WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? NO MATTER HOW THIS GOES, THE FANBOYS FOR THESE CARS ARE SO SERIOUS.
YOU1000000151_S0000014	WELL, THAT'S TRUE. THIS IS THE WRONG REVIEW. THESE ARE THE WRONG
YOU1000000151_S0000016	SO WHATEVER WE SAY...
YOU1000000151_S0000018	THIS IS ABOUT THE ONLY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ALL THREE OF THESE CARS UNBIASED BY NON OWNERS TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. YOU'VE ASKED FOR IT. SO LET'S GO BE WRONG.
YOU1000000151_S0000020	SO HERE IS THE SAME WHITE FR S WE HAD ON OUR PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY SHOOT.
YOU1000000151_S0000022	IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST 86 FR S THAT WERE IN THE COUNTRY AND I JUST LIKE THIS CAR.
YOU1000000151_S0000023	IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET BACK IN A CAR THAT YOU REMEMBERED LOVING AND IT DIDN'T LET YOU DOWN.
YOU1000000151_S0000025	THE FR S IS NOT DISAPPOINTING ME. PERSONALLY, I FEEL LIKE THE BRZ IS THE BETTER SETUP. HOWEVER, AND I'M GETTING BACK TO THE FR S THINKING I LOVED IT, BUT WE WERE COMPARING AGAINST DIFFERENT CARS.
YOU1000000151_S0000026	THE TWO CARS WE BROUGHT ALONG WITH IT, PRETTY STEEP COMPETITION.
YOU1000000151_S0000028	LAST TIME WE DROVE THE RX 8 FOR THE SHOW IT WAS AN 04. THIS IS A 2011. IN FACT, IT'S THE LAST RX 8 R3 SOLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND I MAINTAIN THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAR IS JUST ODD.
YOU1000000151_S0000029	JUST KIND OF OFF KILTER UNIQUE, THIS SECOND GENERATION RX 8 IS DEFINITELY MORE REFINED THAN THE FIRST GENERATION.
YOU1000000151_S0000030	AFTER HAVING DRIVEN THE FIRST GENERATION RX 8, I FEEL LIKE THAT CAR WAS MORE WILLING, JUST SLIGHTLY MORE WILLING THAN THIS CAR. BUT WHAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'VE DONE IS COMPLETELY TAKE AWAY THAT FUN TO DRIVE, THAT JUST
YOU1000000151_S0000031	BRILLIANT ENTHUSIASM. SO THIS CAR REPRESENTS THE MOST SORTED, BEST EXAMPLE OF THE RX 8.
YOU1000000151_S0000033	OF COURSE, THERE'S TWO VERSIONS OF THE HONDA S2000, AND THEY ARE MUCH DEBATED, THE AP1 AND THE AP2. THIS IS AN AP2. IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE AP1 VERSION WITH A HIGHER REDLINE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE TAIL HAPPY SUSPENSION,
YOU1000000151_S0000034	THEN YOU CAN GET THEM CHEAPER. BUT IN THIS AP2, THEY DEFINITELY REFINED THE CAR. AND OF COURSE, YOU'RE BUYING ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLE CARS EVER MADE. THE GUY THAT OWNS THIS HAS GOT ALMOST 80,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING MORE THAN STANDARD MAINTENANCE.
YOU1000000151_S0000035	WHAT'S GREAT IS YOU'VE GOT THAT NEARLY BULLETPROOF NATURE OF HONDA CARS, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEATING ON THIS THING. NOW THE CAR WE'RE DRIVING TODAY IS THE CAR WE DROVE IN OUR STANDALONE HONDA S2000 REVIEW. SO DRIVING IT LATER
YOU1000000151_S0000036	IT'S GOT OF COURSE MORE MILES AND IT STILL FEELS FRESH. I'M SAD TO SAY THESE CARS ARE NO LONGER THE MARKET. AND IT'S ALSO A TRAGEDY THAT HONDA IS BUILDING THINGS LIKE THE HONDA PANAMERA, I MEAN THE HONDA CROSSTOUR.
YOU1000000151_S0000038	GETTING RIGHT OUT OF THE OTHER CARS INTO THE FR S IS TRULY REVEALING. I WASN'T THINKING THAT THE FR S NEEDED MORE POWER. I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE.
YOU1000000151_S0000040	I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT. IN SPITE OF BEING THE LEAST POWERFUL, THE FR S IS ACTUALLY THE EASIEST TO LAUNCH. BUT IT ALSO RUNS OUT OF BREATH THE FASTEST. I MEAN, ABOVE ABOUT 5,000 RPMS, IF YOU PUT YOUR FOOT TO THE FLOOR...
YOU1000000151_S0000041	YOU EXPECT THAT EXTRA LITTLE SURGE WHEN YOU MAT THE GAS AND IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. HERE I AM STEPPING ON THE THROTTLE AND I FEEL LIKE THE FR S IS HOLDING SOMETHING BACK.
YOU1000000151_S0000043	AND THAT FEELING ISN'T THAT IT'S HOLDING SOMETHING BACK, IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE TO GIVE.
YOU1000000151_S0000045	NOW, THIS S2000 HAS THE 40 MORE HORSEPOWER THAT WE WISH WE HAD IN THE FR S.
YOU1000000151_S0000047	BUT IT HAS ALMOST THE EXACT SAME TORQUE.
YOU1000000151_S0000049	SO BECAUSE OF THE MUCH LOVED HONDA VTEC ENGINE, YOU'VE GOT TO REV IT PRETTY HIGH TO FIND THE POWER IN THIS CAR.
YOU1000000151_S0000050	THERE'S ENOUGH THERE, I'M NOT WANTING FOR POWER, AND AS HARD AS YOU CAN REV THE ENGINE, IT'S JUST A CONSTANT SURGE.
YOU1000000151_S0000052	AND YOU FEEL THAT VTEC CHANGEOVER RIGHT ABOUT 6,000 RPMS. AND IT GIVES YOU THAT EXTRA LITTLE KICK IN THE ASS WHEN THE FR S IS JUST DYING AWAY. THE S2000 IS A SECOND FASTER, 0 60, THAN THE FR S.
YOU1000000151_S0000053	I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY STAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO REMIND YOU THAT THE FR S IS JUST UNDERPOWERED.
YOU1000000151_S0000055	THE RX 8 ALSO HAS THE MISSING INGREDIENT THE FR S DOES NOT, MORE POWER.
YOU1000000151_S0000056	AND THIS ENGINE, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S ATYPICAL, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ITS REPUTATION IS NOT ALL THAT RELIABLE, IT'S SO SILKY SMOOTH. IT FEELS LIKE SOMEHOW THIS ENGINE IS BETTER LUBRICATED AND BETTER BUILT THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER DRIVEN.
YOU1000000151_S0000057	THERE'S NO VIBRATION, IT JUST SINGS UP THROUGH THE RPM, HEADED TOWARD ITS 9,000 RPM REDLINE. HOWEVER, EVEN THOUGH THE RX 8 IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FR S, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE IT.
YOU1000000151_S0000058	IT'S NOT REALLY ANY FASTER, AND LIKE THE FR S, IT NEVER GIVES ME AS MUCH AS I EXPECT.
YOU1000000151_S0000060	THE RX 8 MAKES GREAT POWER. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO NOT THINK THAT IT DOES ANYWHERE BELOW 5,000 RPM.
YOU1000000151_S0000062	YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB THIS CAR BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK, SMACK IT AROUND AND MAKE IT YOUR BITCH. OTHERWISE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SMILING. ONCE YOU DO, YOU WILL BE HAPPY.
YOU1000000151_S0000064	NOW I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR EVERY PERSON YOU HEAR ABOUT WHO'S GONE 150,000 MILES ON THEIR FIRST ROTARY ENGINE, THERE'S THE GUY NEXT TO HIM WITH AN RX 8 THAT'S DONE THREE ENGINES IN 150,000 MILES. THE BIG TRICK IS THESE ENGINES BURN A LOT OF GAS.
YOU1000000151_S0000065	AND THEY BURN A LOT OF OIL. JUST DURING THE HARD DRIVING OF THIS SHOOT WE'VE BURNED ALMOST A HALF QUART OF OIL.
YOU1000000151_S0000067	NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ALL THREE OF THESE CARS IS THEY'VE GOT ELECTRIC POWER STEERING.
YOU1000000151_S0000068	FOR ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FOR POOR ELECTRIC STEERING RACKS IN CARS, EACH OF THESE THREE CARS HAVE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING, AND ALL OF THEM GET IT RIGHT.
YOU1000000151_S0000069	SO IF YOU'VE ASSOCIATED ELECTRIC POWER STEERING WITH SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING A FIELD GOER, OR HAVE GOOD STEERING FEEDBACK, YOU'RE COMPLETELY WRONG.
YOU1000000151_S0000071	NOW THE STEERING ON THE RX 8 DOESN'T FEEL QUITE AS SHARP, BUT WHAT'S NICE IS THE HARDER YOU PUSH THIS CAR, THE BETTER IT GETS.
YOU1000000151_S0000072	IF YOU COMPARE THE RX 8'S STEERING TO MOST CARS, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO WIN. IT IS A VERY INFORMATIVE STEERING RACK, BUT IT FEELS LARGER AND MORE DISCONNECTED THAN THE OTHER TWO CARS.
YOU1000000151_S0000074	IF YOU THINK THE HANDLING ON THE RX 8 IS NUMB, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD EXAMINED. I WOULD SAY THE STEERING FEELS SLIGHTLY MUTED, BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL NUMB.
YOU1000000151_S0000076	THIS IS SO STRANGE, I CAN FEEL THE LONGER WHEELBASE, BUT IT PLANTS ITSELF SO WELL.
YOU1000000151_S0000078	NOW, THIS R3 MAKES IT FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE. IT'S GOT A STIFFER SUSPENSION, AND IN FACT, THIS CAR HAS THE LONGEST WHEELBASE, BUT THE WORST RIDE ON THE HIGHWAY. IT JUST KIND OF VIBRATES AND POPS AS YOU GO ALONG AT NORMAL HIGHWAY SPEEDS.
YOU1000000151_S0000080	EVEN IN THIS COMPANY, THE FR S IS AN INCREDIBLY EASY CAR TO DRIVE VERY FAST. NOW, OF COURSE, IT CAN'T GET UP TO SPEED AS FAST, BUT ONCE YOU'RE THERE, THIS CAN HANG ON TO SPEED IN CORNERS ALMOST BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO.
YOU1000000151_S0000081	WITH A BETTER SET OF TIRES, I THINK YOU CAN OUTGRIP THEM BOTH. BUT THE GREAT THING IS, THIS JUST TELLS YOU SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. PARTIALLY BECAUSE THE LIMITS IN THE FR S ARE LOW ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN APPROACH THEM SAFELY AND YOU CAN FEEL THEM COMING.
YOU1000000151_S0000083	IN SOME WAYS, THE FR S IS LIKE HAVING A REALLY GOOD NAVIGATOR. THEY'RE TELLING YOU INFORMATION ALL THE TIME, AND THE FASTER YOU DRIVE, THE MORE THEIR INFORMATION JUST INCREASES.
YOU1000000151_S0000084	I REALLY DO LOVE THE FLICKABILITY OF THIS CAR. IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE IT'S ON AN EDGE.
YOU1000000151_S0000086	THE CHASSIS DYNAMICS ARE GOOD BECAUSE OF THAT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY, BECAUSE OF WHERE THAT ENGINE IS AT. BUT TO TURN THE FR S FROM REALLY, REALLY GOOD INTO GREAT, IT NEEDS MORE POWER.
YOU1000000151_S0000087	I WAS WRONG.
YOU1000000151_S0000089	IT'S GOOD.
YOU1000000151_S0000091	BUT IT ISN'T THE HONDA S2000
YOU1000000151_S0000093	THERE'S ZERO BODY ROLL IN THIS CAR. I MEAN, SHORT OF LIKE THE CORVETTE ZR1 WE DROVE, THIS HAS GOT THE LEAST BODY ROLL I'VE EVER FELT. AND OF COURSE, THE S2000 BRAGS A 50 50 WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION, AND IT WEIGHS WHAT THE FR S WEIGHS.
YOU1000000151_S0000095	THIS CAR'S HANDLING IS UNBELIEVABLY SHARP. AND WHAT I LOVE IS YOU CAN JUST ROLL ONTO THE THROTTLE AND PUSH IT HARDER AND HARDER.
YOU1000000151_S0000097	THROUGH THE CORNER, JUST LIKE YOU DO A MOTORCYCLE. THE HARDER YOU ROLL ONTO THE THROTTLE, THE MORE IT SETTLES THE CAR.
YOU1000000151_S0000098	THE FR S HAS A LITTLE BIT BETTER INITIAL TURN IN BECAUSE THE STEERING RACK IS TIGHTER, BUT THE S2000 SEEMS TO LINK THE CORNER MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN THE FR S. IT GETS A LITTLE BIT OF SLIDE, A LITTLE BIT OF SCRUB GOING ON, AND THE S2000 JUST CLINGS AND HANGS ON.
YOU1000000151_S0000100	GETTING BACK IN THE FRS IS LIKE LOOKING UP YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ON FACEBOOK AND
YOU1000000151_S0000102	FINDING OUT THAT SHE'S
YOU1000000151_S0000104	ALMOST AS GOOD AS YOU REMEMBER HER. BUT HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THE FR S. THIS IS VERSION 1.0.
YOU1000000151_S0000106	DESIGNED THIS CAR AND MADE IT SPECIFICALLY WITH THE THINKING IN MIND THAT
YOU1000000151_S0000107	PEOPLE WOULD BE ADDING TO IT. HOWEVER, I WANT THIS CAR TO BE JUST THAT MUCH BETTER. IT'S SO GOOD. WHY CAN'T IT BE RIGHT?
YOU1000000151_S0000108	I REALLY DO LOVE THIS CAR. I STEP AWAY FOR A WHILE AND I THINK IT REALLY PROBABLY WASN'T THAT GOOD AND I COME BACK AND I REALIZE, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE FR S IS OVERHYPED. BUT THE ACCOLADES IT'S GOTTEN ARE COMPLETELY DESERVED.
YOU1000000151_S0000109	THIS IS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE CAR. IT IS A REWARDING AND FUN TO DRIVE CAR. AND HOW RARELY IS THAT AVAILABLE AT 25 GRAND NEW.
YOU1000000151_S0000111	THIS HAS ALL THE REFINEMENT AND THE FINE TUNING THAT THE FR S JUST HASN'T GOTTEN YET. I EXPECT THAT IT WILL, BUT THIS RX 8 IS ABOUT AS GREAT AS THIS CAR IS GOING TO GET, AND IT FEELS VERY REFINED.
YOU1000000151_S0000112	I REMEMBER LIKING THE FIRST GENERATION RX 8. IT WAS VERY WILLING AND I LOVE THIS CAR EVEN MORE.
YOU1000000151_S0000113	THE THING ABOUT THE RX 8 FOR ME IS THAT I'M VERY IMPRESSED. I RESPECT IT. I JUST CAN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH IT.
YOU1000000151_S0000115	IT'S LIKE MEETING A FRIEND OF YOURS' GIRLFRIEND, AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT SHE'S HOT, BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON, SHE JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.
YOU1000000151_S0000117	I'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO MY HEART. I'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO THE CAR THAT MADE ME GRIN AS SOON AS I GOT IN IT AGAIN. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE MOST PURE, THE CLEAREST DRIVING EXPERIENCE.
YOU1000000151_S0000118	FOR ENTHUSIASTS. IT'S THE HONDA S2000.
YOU1000000151_S0000119	NOW THE DOWNSIDES TO THE S2000 KIND OF PUT ME IN A DILEMMA. IT'S CRAMPED IN HERE, IT'S LOUD, YOU'VE GOT TO SEND THE ENGINE REVVING TO THE STRATOSPHERE TO GET ANY POWER OUT OF IT. THESE ARE ALL THE SAME ISSUES I HAVE WITH THE LOTUS ELISE.
YOU1000000151_S0000120	AND AT 25 TO 30 GRAND, I'M JUST GOING TO BUY THE LOTUS. BUT AT 15 TO 20 GRAND, THIS CAR MAKES ALL KINDS OF SENSE.
YOU1000000151_S0000122	WHAT A DAY.
YOU1000000151_S0000124	AND WHAT AN AMAZING THREE CARS.
YOU1000000151_S0000126	I SAT AT EACH OF THESE CRITIQUING THEM AND THINKING, WE'RE SPLITTING HAIRS HERE.
YOU1000000151_S0000127	WE ARE. THIS IS WHISKER DIFFERENCES, AND I'M HONEST, WHEN I SAY I CAME INTO THIS DAY WITH AN OPEN MIND. TRULY. I KIND OF THOUGHT I'D COME IN PICKING THE FR S, AND I DIDN'T. I LOVE THE FR S.
YOU1000000151_S0000128	IT'S A GREAT CAR.
YOU1000000151_S0000129	IT'S FANTASTIC. BUT THE CAR I JUMPED INTO AND JUST STARTED SMILING, I KNEW WAS THE WINNER FOR ME AND THAT WAS THE S2000.
YOU1000000151_S0000130	I WANTED THE FR S TO LIVE UP TO THE HYPE AND BE THE BEST CAR HERE. AND I HAVE TO SAY, I LOVE IT. IT'S A GREAT CAR. IT'S STILL A FOUR STAR. IT'S STILL IN MY TOP FIVE. IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT THE S2000 IS BETTER.
YOU1000000151_S0000131	I CAN'T BELIEVE A CAR THAT'S 10 YEARS OLD IS STILL SO FANTASTIC. THIS IS HONDA AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME.
YOU1000000151_S0000132	YEAH, WHERE HAS THAT CAR GONE IN HONDA'S LINEUP? THAT'S THE CAR, YOU KNOW ME, I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF CONVERTIBLES. THAT'S THE CAR THAT WOULD MAKE ME BUY A CONVERTIBLE. I LIKE IT THAT MUCH. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE CAR.
YOU1000000151_S0000133	WELL, THESE TWO CARS ALSO ANSWERED THE BURNING QUESTION, DOES THE FR S NEED MORE POWER?
YOU1000000151_S0000135	NOW I'VE REALIZED IT SHOULD. AND THESE CARS HAVE 40 MORE HORSEPOWER.
YOU1000000151_S0000137	AND THEY HAVE BETTER WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION, SO THEY'RE A BIT MORE PREDICTABLE. NOT THAT THE FR S IS BAD THOUGH.
YOU1000000151_S0000139	I REALLY LIKE THIS CAR. I SHOULD PUT IT ANOTHER WAY. I RESPECT THIS CAR.
YOU1000000151_S0000140	OK.
YOU1000000151_S0000141	I CAN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT IT. THE OTHER TWO JUST SPARKED ME I FALL IN LOVE WITH THOSE TWO CARS. I'VE GOT TO PUT THE RX 8 THIRD, BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S A BAD CAR IT'S A GREAT CAR. IT'S JUST NOT REALLY FOR ME. I ACTUALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IS AS POWERFUL AS I WANT IT TO BE
YOU1000000151_S0000143	WITH THE FR S, BUT THE S2000 JUST PROVES OUT. 2,800 POUNDS WITH 240 HORSEPOWER, THAT RECIPE STARTS TO BE EXACT. AND THIS ONE GETS CLOSE, BUT IT JUST FALLS SHORT. IF YOU DROVE THEM BY THEMSELVES
YOU1000000151_S0000145	FANTASTIC CAR YOU HAVE NO AWARENESS THAT IT COULD BE DIFFERENT OR BETTER.
YOU1000000151_S0000146	AND OF COURSE OUR DECISIONS COULD BE WRONG AGAIN.
YOU1000000151_S0000148	WITH THESE CARS, THEY WILL BE WRONG. SOMEONE WILL HATE US. SOMEONE WILL LOVE US. TELL US IN THE COMMENTS. WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.
YOU1000000151_S0000150	DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S GREAT.
YOU1000000151_S0000152	BUT IT ISN'T FIRST PLACE GREAT. NOT COMPARED TO THESE OTHER TWO CARS. THE FR S TIES THE S2000 FOR BEST STEERING FEEL. THEY'RE BOTH GOOD AT DIFFERENT THINGS.
YOU1000000151_S0000153	IT'S GOT MY SECOND FAVORITE GEARBOX. IT'S NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE ONE IN THE S2000.
YOU1000000151_S0000155	WHEN I DRIVE IT, I FIND IT THE MOST ENDEARING. IT TALKS TO ME THE MOST. IT WARMS UP TO ME THE BEST. IT'S THE CAR THAT I JUST WANT TO GET INTO IN ANY CONDITION. AND THAT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE.
YOU1000000151_S0000156	IF YOU CAN FIND AN R3 IF YOU CAN FIND ONE FOR SALE
YOU1000000151_S0000158	BUY THIS CAR. THE FASTER YOU GO, THE MORE FUN YOU HAVE, AND IT JUST, IT TURNS INTO A RACE CAR.
YOU1000000151_S0000159	I'M GENUINELY IMPRESSED, BUT I DON'T LUST AFTER THIS CAR. I DON'T WANT ONE. AND I DO THE OTHER TWO.
YOU1000000151_S0000160	FRANKLY, I DIDN'T THINK THIS CAR WOULD WIN FOR ME, BUT YOU REALIZE THIS REPRESENTS HONDA AT THE PEAK OF THEIR POWERS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HONDA HAS GONE COMPLETELY OFF THE RAILS.
YOU1000000151_S0000161	AND GOTTEN AWAY FROM MAKING BRILLIANT DRIVING MACHINES LIKE THE S2000.
YOU1000000151_S0000162	I WILL ADMIT THAT I'M NOT REALLY A CONVERTIBLE GUY, BUT ON A DAY LIKE THIS, ON A ROAD LIKE THIS, THIS CAR STARTS TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.
YOU1000000152_S0000000	SO.
YOU1000000152_S0000001	HOW MANY BATHROOMS ARE IN THE HOUSE?
YOU1000000152_S0000002	21.

YOU1000000152_S0000024	AND YOU LOOK AT ANY 10 YEAR PERIOD OF TIME AND IN THE END OF THE DAY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

YOU1000000152_S0000141	SO AFTER LIKE A HALF HOUR OF NEGOTIATION, NOT ONLY WITH THE MANAGER BUT THE CEO OF LEICA, BRUCE HAD A FLATBED WAITING OUTSIDE LEICA IN BEVERLY HILLS.
YOU1000000152_S0000142	THEY HAD TO TAKE THE STOREFRONT OFF OF LIKERT BECAUSE THIS WAS PUT IN BEFORE THEY PUT THE STOREFRONT.

YOU1000000152_S0000213	ALL RIGHT, WE'RE OUT. THANK YOU.
YOU1000000153_S0000000	SOMETIMES I REALLY FEEL THAT THE WORLD AROUND US CONTINUES TO BE MORE HECTIC AND MORE COMPLICATED AND SO MANY OF US ARE TRULY CRAVING TO FIND SIMPLICITY.
YOU1000000153_S0000001	AND HERE IN QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT A YOUNG COUPLE DISCOVERED WHEN THEY MADE THE DECISION TO BUILD A TINY HOUSE ON WHEELS.
YOU1000000153_S0000003	HI AMY, HOW ARE YOU?
YOU1000000153_S0000004	HI, HOW ARE YOU?
YOU1000000153_S0000005	GOOD, LOVELY TO MEET YOU. G'DAY GREG, HOW'S IT GOING?
YOU1000000153_S0000007	NICE TO MEET YOU, BRYCE.
YOU1000000153_S0000008	IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU AND SUPER COOL TO SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL HOME.
YOU1000000153_S0000009	THANK YOU, WE'RE REALLY GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000010	SO HOW DID YOU COME TO BE LIVING IN A TINY HOUSE?
YOU1000000153_S0000011	WELL, WE ACTUALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE MOVEMENT THROUGH ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS. SO I WAS BINGE WATCHING THE VIDEOS AND SENT ONE OR TWO TO GREG AND THEN SAID, HEY, WHY DON'T WE BUILD A TINY HOUSE? AND TO MY SURPRISE, HE AGREED AND
YOU1000000153_S0000012	TOOK THAT AND RAN WITH IT BEFORE HE COULD CHANGE HIS MIND. SO, YOU KNOW, A FEW MORE MONTHS AND WE HAD A TINY HOUSE OF OUR OWN.
YOU1000000153_S0000013	AND YOU REALLY HAVE FOUND A FANTASTIC PARKING SPOT FOR THE HOME AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000014	YEAH, WE'RE REALLY LUCKY BECAUSE ONE OF OUR FRIENDS HAS BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO JUST LET US PARK UP HERE ON OUR PROPERTY IN ONE OF THE GOAT PADDOCKS ESSENTIALLY. SO YEAH, IT'S REALLY NICE. WE GET A NICE VIEW. IT'S VERY QUIET. WE GET AWAY FROM A LOT OF THE STREET NOISE AND IT'S JUST
YOU1000000153_S0000015	PEACEFUL.
YOU1000000153_S0000016	YEAH, GIVES US A BIT OF LAND AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VEGGIE PATCH AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. SO, AND WE HAVE THAT NICE COMMUNITY SPIRIT WITH HER AND CAN HAVE A FAMILY DINNER EVERY FORTNIGHT. AND YEAH, I COULDN'T WANT MORE, I GUESS.
YOU1000000153_S0000017	AND WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU REALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA OF LIVING IN A TINY HOUSE?
YOU1000000153_S0000018	I THINK FOR US IT'S PROBABLY THE SIMPLICITY OF THE LIFESTYLE. I THINK ALSO THE FINANCIAL FREEDOM. SO THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST PART FOR US. WE DON'T WANT TO BE TIED DOWN TO A JOB AND THEN YOU KNOW WE CAN LIVE A LIFESTYLE WE TRULY LOVE.
YOU1000000153_S0000019	YEAH, DEFINITELY.
YOU1000000153_S0000020	AND TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AESTHETIC OF THIS HOME. IT'S BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED.
YOU1000000153_S0000021	WELL, HONESTLY MOST OF IT WAS AMY. WE DID IT MAINLY FROM EVERYTHING FROM THE OUTSIDE IS MAINLY BASED FROM AROUND THAT GIANT WINDOW. WE DECIDED THAT ANY ROOM THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE INSIDE WE WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE COULD
YOU1000000153_S0000022	REALLY SPENDS A LOT OF TIME OUTSIDE ENJOYING IT.
YOU1000000153_S0000023	I THINK I WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD KIND OF SINK INTO THE BACKGROUND, SO NOTHING THAT WOULD STAND OUT TOO MUCH. AND I LIKE THE CEDAR, THE NATURAL LOOK OF THAT. AND I THINK WHILST IT CAN STILL SINK INTO THE BACKGROUND AND IT DOESN'T STAND OUT TOO MUCH, IT'S REALLY QUITE STRIKING AND MODERN.
YOU1000000153_S0000024	AND WE REALLY DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME WHEN WE WERE IN A BIGGER HOUSE. WE SPENT A LOT MORE TIME IN OUR OUTDOOR AREA AS IT WAS. SO WE KEPT THE SAME OUTDOOR AREA AND JUST MADE A BIT MORE SPACE, ESSENTIALLY, THAN WHAT WE HAD THERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000025	THAT'S IT. SO ALL OF THE DECKING IS MODULAR. SO GREG SPENT HOURS LABORING AWAY WITH PALLET WOOD AND EVERYTHING SO HE COULD KEEP THE COSTS DOWN AND MINIMIZE THAT FOOTPRINT ON EVERYTHING AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000026	WE'VE DONE THAT SO IF WE EVER NEED A MOVE WE CAN PULL IT ALL APART. IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT TASK, IT WOULDN'T BE SIMPLE, BUT IT CAN BE DONE AND WE CAN TAKE IT TO OUR NEXT PARKING SPOT.
YOU1000000153_S0000027	REALLY GOOD SIZED WATER TANK HERE AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000028	YES, SO I THINK WATER WAS KEY. WE MANAGED TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE DROUGHT PERIOD THAT WE WERE HERE ONLY JUST BEFORE WE GOT ALL THAT DOWNFALL WHICH WAS GREAT BUT HAVING THE TWO KIDS AND US WE REALLY NEEDED A LARGE TANK SO WE HAVE GONE WITH A 10,000 LITRE TANK THERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000029	COLOUR BOND SO IT WASN'T PLASTIC WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE QUALITY OF WATER FOR US AND IT TIES IN REALLY NICELY WITH THE DESIGN OF THE HOUSE SO THAT WAS A BONUS.
YOU1000000153_S0000030	AND NOW, MOST OF THE TIME YOU LIVE HERE BY YOURSELVES, BUT GREG, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE YOUR KIDS OVER AS WELL, DON'T YOU?
YOU1000000153_S0000031	YES, EVERY SECOND WEEK FOR FIVE DAYS WE HAVE THEM, MY SON WHO'S TURNING 13 THIS YEAR AND MY DAUGHTER WHO IS 10. WE THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE A BIT OF TROUBLE ADAPTING TO IT BUT IT WAS HONESTLY VERY SMOOTH. WHEN WE INTRODUCED THEM TO THE HOUSE THEY GOT EXCITED AND THEN
YOU1000000153_S0000032	IT WAS LIKE, YAY, WE HAVE SOMEWHERE TO SLEEP, NOW LET'S GO PLAY OUTSIDE.
YOU1000000153_S0000033	AND SO WHAT SIZE IS THE TINY HOUSE?
YOU1000000153_S0000034	SO THIS ONE IS 7.2 METRES LONG, THAT'S 2.4 WIDE AND ABOUT 4.2 HIGH, SO WE TRY TO KEEP IT ALL WITH THE LEGAL SPECS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT ON THE ROAD.
YOU1000000153_S0000035	WELL THE HOUSE IS JUST BEAUTIFUL FROM THE OUTSIDE. I REALLY LOVE THIS WONDERFUL ENTERTAINING DECK THAT YOU'VE BUILT ONTO IT AND I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT GOING ON INSIDE. SHALL WE CHECK IT OUT?
YOU1000000153_S0000036	YES, LET'S DO IT.
YOU1000000153_S0000037	ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
YOU1000000153_S0000039	OH, THIS IS GORGEOUS.
YOU1000000153_S0000040	THANK YOU, WE ARE VERY PROUD OF IT.
YOU1000000153_S0000041	IT'S ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL JUST WALKING IN AND IMMEDIATELY BEING GREETED BY THIS VERY COMFORTABLE LOOKING LOUNGE.
YOU1000000153_S0000042	YEAH, COMFORT WAS THE MAIN GOAL WITH THIS. SO WE FOUND THAT IN OUR REGULAR SIZED HOUSE. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE LOUNGE ROOM ON THE COUCH WATCHING MOVIES, PLAYING GAMES WITH THE KIDS. SO WE NEEDED A COUCH THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE ALL FOUR OF US.
YOU1000000153_S0000043	AND BE COMFORTABLE. SO WE DESIGNED THE LAYOUT ACTUALLY OF THE LOUNGE ROOM BASED OFF THE SIZES OF THIS COUCH. SO THE CHASE DOES DOUBLE AS STORAGE WHICH IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN YOUR TINY HOUSE.
YOU1000000153_S0000045	THE BED OBVIOUSLY IT PULLS OUT FROM UNDER THERE AS WELL WHICH IS GREAT TO HAVE THAT EXTRA SLEEPING SPACE IF YOU NEED IT.
YOU1000000153_S0000046	WE ACTUALLY FIND THAT WE SPREAD THAT OUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. YEAH, WE LIKE TO PULL THAT OUT. TO HAVE MORE FAMILY TIME REALLY. WE SPEND MORE TIME WITH IT OUT JUST HANGING OUT LIKE THAT RATHER THAN JUST IN THIS L SHAPED COUCH.
YOU1000000153_S0000047	FORMAL SEATING. WE LIKE TO LAZE OUT, WATCH A MOVIE, PLAY OUR GAMES.
YOU1000000153_S0000048	YEAH.
YOU1000000153_S0000049	SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. AND LOTS OF WINDOWS HERE GIVING YOU REALLY NICE VIEWS INTO THE OUTDOORS.
YOU1000000153_S0000050	YEAH, WE REALLY WANTED TO CAPITALISE ON THE VIEW AND BRING IN AS MUCH NATURAL LIGHT AS POSSIBLE. FOR A TINY HOUSE, I THINK IF IT'S SMALL, IT CAN FEEL EVEN SMALLER IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT NATURAL LIGHT AND THAT JUST MAKES IT FEEL AIRY AND BRIGHT AND DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL SO CLAUSTROPHOBIC, I THINK.
YOU1000000153_S0000052	AND THEN WE ALSO GET A BEAUTIFUL CROSS BREEZE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IN THE HOT WEATHER HERE SO THAT HELPS AS WELL, KEEPS THE PLACE COOL.
YOU1000000153_S0000053	YEAH, IT CERTAINLY IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THE WEATHER HERE, YOU REALLY DO GET SOME EXTREMES, DON'T YOU?
YOU1000000153_S0000055	SAID, I THINK IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE HAD FLOODS AND DROUGHTS SO YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT WAY TO BE ABLE TO STILL KEEP COOL AND KEEP THAT ELECTRICITY BILL DOWN.
YOU1000000153_S0000056	AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD SIZED KITCHEN HERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000057	YES, SO WE DO A LOT OF MEAL PREPPING, SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD LIKE A BIG BENCH. I THINK THAT WAS KEY FOR US BECAUSE WE DO THE MEAL PREPPING TOGETHER, SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER IN THIS SPACE AT ONE TIME. AND THEN IT ALSO DOUBLES AS A GREAT SPACE TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND HAVE OUR FOOD AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000058	STUDY SPACE. SO ORIGINALLY WE MADE SURE THAT THIS BENCH SPACE THAT IS AT THE END HERE WAS MAINLY JUST SO THAT WE COULD DO WORK OR STUDY THERE AS WELL. SO WE'VE GOT SPACE TO DO IT.
YOU1000000153_S0000059	YEAH, AND WE ALSO WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF OVERHEAD CUPBOARD SPACE THERE AS WELL FOR STORAGE AND TO KEEP IT NICE AND TIDY RATHER THAN AN OPEN SHELVING JUST BECAUSE IT GETS QUITE DUSTY OUT HERE IN THE BUSH AREA.
YOU1000000153_S0000060	AND IT'S SO LOVELY HOW THIS WINDOW HERE CAN JUST COMPLETELY OPEN THE KITCHEN UP TO THE OUTDOORS.
YOU1000000153_S0000061	YEAH, SO WE ACTUALLY DESIGNED A LOT OF THE HOUSE AROUND THAT BY FALL WINDOW THERE AND WHEN IT OPENS UP IT REALLY DOES BRINGS THE OUTSIDE IN WE USE IT A LOT WITH
YOU1000000153_S0000062	IF WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER, WE MEAL PREP HERE AND JUST HAND THE MEALS OVER OUT THERE AND WE CAN ALL STILL TALK AND COMMUNICATE TOGETHER AND THIS SORT OF STARTS TO FEEL MORE LIKE AN ISLAND BENCH IN A KITCHEN RATHER THAN A WALL SEPARATING YOU GUYS AND IT'S REALLY COOL.
YOU1000000153_S0000063	AND THEN REALLY GOOD SIZE APPLIANCES HERE IN THE KITCHEN, FULL SIZE FRIDGE AND LOTS OF STORAGE THAT'S BEEN BUILT INTO THE STAIRS THERE TOO.
YOU1000000153_S0000064	YES, SO THIS WAS A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT TO WORK. THE FRIDGE WAS FROM OUR PREVIOUS STANDARD HOUSE AND WE WANTED TO KEEP THAT JUST BECAUSE WE LIKE THE DESIGN OF THE FRIDGE SPACE BEING UP THE TOP. WE'VE POPPED OUR MICROWAVE IN HERE WHICH IS
YOU1000000153_S0000065	KEEPING IT NICE AND WELL HIDDEN. ALSO HAS EXTRA STORAGE FOR CHOPPING BOARDS AND BREAD WHICH IS REALLY GREAT TO KEEP THE CABINETS NICE AND CLEAR UP HERE. THE REST OF THE STORAGE SHOWER IS ACTUALLY FOR OUR CLOTHING AND THEN BEHIND THESE BASKETS WE'VE GOT QUITE A DEEP SPACE HERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000066	SO WE CAN HIDE EXTRA ITEMS LIKE OUR BLENDER IN THERE AS WELL, AND SOME CLOTHING AND A SPOT UP THERE FOR ALL THE DOG STUFF AS WELL. KEEPS IT ALL NEAT AND TIDY AND KEEPS OUR BENCHES CLEAR, WHICH IS REALLY GOOD.
YOU1000000153_S0000067	YEAH AND BECAUSE WE LIKE TO FOOD PREP SO MUCH NOT DOWNSIZING ON THE OVEN WAS ESSENTIAL FOR US AS WELL SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEPT THAT OVEN THE RIGHT SIZE. WE DOWNGRADED TO THE TWO BURNER STOVE BUT THAT WASN'T AN ISSUE REALLY BECAUSE
YOU1000000153_S0000068	YEAH, LIKE WE DO THINGS OUT OF A SLOW COOKER OR THE OVEN THE REST OF THE TIME, SO IT WASN'T REALLY A PROBLEM.
YOU1000000153_S0000069	AND THE OTHER STORIES THAT WE REALLY LOVE IN HERE IS ACTUALLY OUR PULL UP PANTRY. SO A LOT OF WORK WENT INTO THAT AND WE ACTUALLY MEASURED OUT HOW THICK WE NEEDED IT TO BE TO FIT JARS IN AND EVERYTHING. SO MAKE THE MOST OF THAT SPACE AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000070	THEN WE'VE GOT THE LOFT ABOVE US HERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000071	YES, SO THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN ADDITION THAT WE ADDED TO THE STANDARD DESIGN WITH THIS ONE. WE NEEDED TO HAVE A SPACE FOR THE CHILDREN AS WELL. SO THAT'S REALLY GREAT BECAUSE THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OWN SPACE AND BE APART FROM US BUT THEY'RE STILL PART OF THE FAMILY UNIT.
YOU1000000153_S0000072	WE CHOSE NOT TO ENCLOSE IT JUST SO I COULD HAVE THAT OPEN FEEL AND ALSO TO LIMIT IT GETTING TOO HOT UP THERE WITH THE CROSS BREEZE AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000073	AND THEN THROUGH THERE WE HAVE YOUR BATHROOM AND IT'S REALLY NICE HOW YOU'VE CREATED THIS FULL LENGTH LOUVER WINDOW.
YOU1000000153_S0000074	YES, THE WINDOW WE WANTED TO CREATE A SPACE I GUESS WHERE FROM ONE END OF THE HOUSE TO THE OTHER IT WAS REALLY OPEN ENDED SO WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN THE LOUNGE ROOM AND LOOKING THROUGH
YOU1000000153_S0000075	YOU JUST SEE STRAIGHT OUT INTO NATURE AND IT DOESN'T JUST CUT THE HOUSE OFF AND FEEL LIKE IT SUDDENLY ENDS.
YOU1000000153_S0000076	GREAT SIZE SHOWER YOU'VE GOT IN HERE
YOU1000000153_S0000077	YES, SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME AS A 900, IT'S I THINK 820 BY 820, SO A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN NORMAL, BUT WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL SHOWER HEAD WHICH MAKES IT REALLY LUXURIOUS TO HAVE A SHOWER IN THERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000078	WE ALSO HAVE THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER LEVER WINDOW THERE JUST TO TRY BRING THE INSIDE OUT AGAIN AND ALSO TO EXTRACT SOME OF THAT STEAM WHICH CAN CAUSE A BIT OF TROUBLE IN A TINY SPACE AS WELL. SO IT FEELS VERY LOVELY HAVING A SHOWER IN THERE ACTUALLY, PROBABLY BETTER THAN OUR OLD HOUSE.
YOU1000000153_S0000079	IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHOWERS WE'VE EVER HAD IN THAT THING. SO YEAH, IT'S AMAZING.
YOU1000000153_S0000080	AND THEN IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU'VE GOT THE COMPOSTING TOILET HERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000081	YES, SO THAT WAS PROBABLY OUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT THE HOUSE. REALLY? YEAH, IT WAS THE TOILET WHEN WE ASKED THAT QUESTION. I THINK IT'S JUST THAT IT'S SO UNIQUE IN DESIGN AND BEING IN A DROUGHT AREA I GUESS, IT'S SO GREAT WITH THE WATER USAGE.
YOU1000000153_S0000083	YEAH, WE THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPED US GET THROUGH A PART OF THAT DROUGHT PERIOD BEFORE WE STARTED TO GET ALL THE FLOODS WAS THE FACT THAT WE DID NOT HAVE A FLUSHING TOILET. WE WERE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THE END OF OUR TANK AND WE THANKFULLY GOT THE RAIN BUT YEAH, THE COMPOSTING TOILET, IT DOESN'T USE
YOU1000000153_S0000084	WATER TO GET RID OF IT, IT'S SO MUCH EASIER.
YOU1000000153_S0000085	AND GREAT TO SEE YOU'VE GOT THE WASHING MACHINE THERE AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000087	THAT'S IT FROM OUR OLD HOUSE AS WELL. WE'VE WORKED OUT REALLY WELL, DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY NEW APPLIANCES. NO NEED FOR A DRYER IN THIS CLIMATE. SO WE JUST HANG EVERYTHING UP OUTSIDE UNDER THE DECK OR IN THE SUN.
YOU1000000153_S0000088	WE DO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE A LOT OF THE ECO FRIENDLY DISHWASHING LIQUIDS AND THE LAUNDRY DETERGENT IS THE SAME AS WELL SO THAT WHEN IT RUNS OFF TO OUR GREY WATER, BECAUSE WE USE THAT OUT IN OUR GRASSES AND GARDENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, WE WILL HELP.
YOU1000000153_S0000089	YEAH, NOT PUTTING ANYTHING TOXIC OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000090	OF COURSE.
YOU1000000153_S0000091	SO RECYCLE ALL THE WATER WE CAN HERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000092	YEAH, AND THEN REALLY NICE SIZE VANITY IN HERE AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000093	YES, SO I THINK EVERY GIRL WANTS A NICE BIG VANITY. SO THIS WAS KIND OF MY BRAINCHILD. I WANTED THE PENDANT LIGHTS AND THE SHELVING FOR MY BEAUTY PRODUCTS. A BIG NICE THING TO BE ABLE TO WASH MY FACE AND DO MY MAKEUP.
YOU1000000153_S0000095	AND I THINK IT JUST, IT WORKS REALLY WELL AS WELL WITH THE KIDS. GENERALLY, GETTING THE KIDS READY FOR SCHOOL, THERE'S TWO OF THEM IN THE BATHROOM, IT'S NICE AND BIG, THEY CAN BOTH STILL BRUSH THEIR TEETH, DO THEIR HAIR, DO WHAT THEY NEED TO AT THE SAME TIME, NO ONE'S FIGHTING. AND YEAH, IT WORKS GOOD.
YOU1000000153_S0000096	AND THEN UPSTAIRS WE'VE GOT YOUR SLEEPING LOFT.
YOU1000000153_S0000097	YES, A LITTLE SANCTUARY.
YOU1000000153_S0000099	THIS IS JUST SO COZY UP HERE. AND HAVING THAT SKYLIGHT IS JUST LOVELY, ISN'T IT?
YOU1000000153_S0000100	YEAH, THIS LOFT IS OUR SANCTUARY AND THIS SKYLIGHT REALLY JUST MAKES IT WHAT IT IS. IT BRINGS IN ALL OF THAT LIGHT.
YOU1000000153_S0000101	YEAH, I THINK EVEN COMPARED TO OUR BEDROOMS AT PREVIOUS HOMES, THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMFORTABLE AND LUXURIOUS THAT WE'VE HAD. WE INVESTED IN A GOOD MATTRESS THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT THINNER SO IT COULD GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA ROOM.
YOU1000000153_S0000102	AND YEAH, IT'S BEEN A LOVELY EXPERIENCE BEING UP HERE.
YOU1000000153_S0000103	I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE SLEEPING LOFTS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY KIND OF FREAK OUT AND SAY I COULD NEVER DO THAT BUT THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING WHICH IS JUST SO COZY AND COMFORTABLE ABOUT CLIMBING INTO A LOFT AND YOU FEEL SO PROTECTED IN THE SPACE LIKE THIS DON'T YOU?
YOU1000000153_S0000105	IT'S LIKE A NEST AND IT'S SAFE. I THINK IF WE HAD HAVE ENCLOSED MAYBE THE FRONT PORTION OF IT, IT MIGHT FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE CLAUSTROPHOBIC, BUT IT'S SO AIRY AND BRIGHT AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T FEEL CONFINED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT'S VERY OPEN.
YOU1000000153_S0000106	THE VIEW THAT WE HAVE IS QUITE NICE AS WELL AND WE GET THE VIEWS OUT TO THE SIDES AND AT NIGHT WE GET THE NIGHT SKY. IT'S AMAZING UP HERE. IT'S NOT ANYTHING TO REALLY BE WORRIED ABOUT. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO.
YOU1000000153_S0000107	YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE TRANSITION TO A LOFT STYLE AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT IDEAL FOR PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY ISSUES BUT THE STAIRS ARE EASY TO NAVIGATE. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES, GOT A HANDRAIL THERE AND EVERYTHING TO HELP.
YOU1000000153_S0000108	YEAH, IT'S BEEN AN EASY TRANSITION.
YOU1000000153_S0000109	AND SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING IN THE TINY HOUSE NOW?
YOU1000000153_S0000110	I THINK WE'RE GOING ON JUST ON SIX MONTHS NOW OF PHIL TIME LIVING IN THE TINY HOUSE. SO IT'S GONE REALLY FAST ACTUALLY.
YOU1000000153_S0000111	WE ACTUALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE WE WENT LIKE FOUR MONTHS WITHOUT A TV.
YOU1000000153_S0000112	YEAH, I MEAN, TIME GOES SO FAST, I GUESS. AND I THINK IN ANOTHER SENSE, IT ALSO DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX MONTHS. YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT WAS AN EASY CHANGE OF LIFESTYLE, CHANGE OF PACE. AND IT'S JUST BEEN SUCH AN EASY TRANSITION INTO IT THAT I THINK IT FEELS LIKE.
YOU1000000153_S0000113	THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS. AND I THINK WE SPENT SUCH A LONG TIME IN THE DESIGN PHASE AND THE BUILDERS WORK SO CLOSELY WITH US. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S GONE INTO THIS THAT ISN'T A WELL THOUGHT OUT PROCESS.
YOU1000000153_S0000114	YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK US, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU OVER THE TINY HOUSE YET?
YOU1000000153_S0000116	IN LOVE WITH THE DESIGN EVERY DAY AND THE LIFESTYLE IT OFFERS.
YOU1000000153_S0000117	ABSOLUTELY.
YOU1000000153_S0000118	AND CAN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PRICE? WHAT DID THIS COST TO BUILD?
YOU1000000153_S0000119	SO ALL UP WE SPENT ABOUT $100,000 SO THAT INCLUDED THE BUILD, FURNISHINGS, THE WATER TANK DELIVERY, SO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN A MORTGAGE.
YOU1000000153_S0000120	EVERYTHING THAT WE PAY FOR DAILY, OR SORRY, MONTHLY NOW AS WELL, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DROPPED. LIKE ELECTRICITY PRICES, LIKE WE'RE NOT OFF GRID YET, BUT WE DO PLAN ON THIS BEING A SOLAR POWERED HOUSE EVENTUALLY AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000121	WITH WATER, LIKE WE SAID, WE'VE GOT A 10,000 LITRE TANK AND THAT GETS US BY FINE. IT'S JUST BEEN A VERY COMFORTABLE TRANSITION WITH MONEY WISE AS WELL. LIKE, EXPENDITURES GOING OUT IS ANOTHER THING THAT MADE IT VERY COMFORTABLE.
YOU1000000153_S0000122	YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU1000000153_S0000123	AND SO WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU BOTH NOW?
YOU1000000153_S0000124	HONESTLY, HOPEFULLY A LOT MORE TRAVEL AND EXPLORING AND LIVING LIFE AND ENJOYING IT. SO HOPEFULLY THE FREEDOM THAT COMES WITH THIS TINY WILL ALLOW US TO BECOME FINANCIALLY FREE AS WELL.
YOU1000000153_S0000125	AND HAVE A FIVE YEAR PLAN HOPEFULLY, AND BUY A BIG BLOCK OF OUR OWN AND YEAH, TO SEE WHERE IT TAKES US I GUESS.
YOU1000000153_S0000126	YEAH, WE'RE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO HOPEFULLY TAKE THIS OVER TO A BIGGER BLOCK. I DON'T THINK WE COULD EVER DO A NORMAL SIZED HOUSE EVER AGAIN THOUGH. NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. TINY IS SOMETHING WE'LL ALWAYS STICK WITH. BUT YEAH, WE'LL DEFINITELY BE DOING A LOT MORE LIVING AGAIN NOW.
YOU1000000153_S0000127	WE CAN. IT'S REALLY OPENED UP A LOT OF FREEDOM IN OUR LIVES. AND IT SEEMS WEIRD TO SAY THAT. I MOVED INTO A SMALLER HOUSE, SO NOW I'M MORE FREE. BUT ONCE YOU DO IT, YOU REALLY GET IT.
YOU1000000153_S0000128	IT BECOMES ABOUT THE LIFESTYLE OPPOSED TO DOING THAT DAILY GRIND TO PAY FOR A HOUSE THAT YOU DON'T GET TO ENJOY.
YOU1000000153_S0000129	WHICH WE THOROUGHLY DO ENJOY.
YOU1000000153_S0000130	YES, ABSOLUTELY. I THINK LIVING IN THIS HOME, IT'S TAUGHT US SOMETHING THAT WE MAYBE DIDN'T EXPECT. I GUESS OUR TRANSITION TO TINY LIVING WAS
YOU1000000153_S0000132	BORN FROM A MORE TRAGIC TIME IN OUR LIFE, YOU KNOW, THE PASSING OF MY FATHER AND EVERYTHING THAT CAUSED US TO QUESTION HOW WE WERE LIVING LIFE AND WHAT DIRECTION WE WERE GOING. YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T WANT TO
YOU1000000153_S0000133	SIT BACK IN 50 YEARS TIME AND REALISE THAT WE HAD WASTED TIME WITH OUR FAMILY AND LOVED ONES AND YOU KNOW GONE THROUGH THE DAILY GRIND AND HAD ENJOYED LIFE. SO IT'S REALLY, IT'S BEEN AN OPENING EXPERIENCE.
YOU1000000153_S0000134	IT GENERALLY COMES DOWN TO TIME, LIKE THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN THIS HOUSE, IT COMES DOWN TO HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE NOW. WE HAVE TIME TOGETHER, WE HAVE TIME TO JUST BE IN
YOU1000000153_S0000135	A SENSE WHERE WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF DAILY LIFE, WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO RELAX TOGETHER, WE'RE ABLE TO PROBLEM SOLVE TOGETHER, WE'RE ABLE TO JUST BE TOGETHER. AND I THINK
YOU1000000153_S0000136	MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY DAY.
YOU1000000153_S0000137	YEAH.
YOU1000000153_S0000138	NOT PROMISED TOMORROW SO YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE WITH IT NOW.

YOU1000000154_S0000161	ABSOLUTELY, YEAH, THIS IS WHITE MARBLE. YEAH. AND WE SET IT UP HERE IN THE FIREPLACE MATCHING THE CEILING DESIGN.
YOU1000000154_S0000162	AND DOUBLE POCKET DOORS ON THE EXTERIOR WHICH WERE REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE THE EXTERIOR DOORS HAVE TO BE WATERPROOF AND THEY GET THEM TO SIT RIGHT INSIDE THE DOOR.
YOU1000000154_S0000163	AND THEN ALSO DID BLACKOUT SHADES.
YOU1000000154_S0000164	FOR ALL THESE WINDOWS IN THIS ROOM WHICH AGAIN WAS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS DESIGN OF THE WINDOWS WOW AND THE UPPER CLEAR STORIES, SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE POCKETS

YOU1000000154_S0000184	RIGHT, SO WE CALL THIS AN INTEGRATED SINK, WHICH MEANS WE TAKE STONE, IN THIS CASE THE CAESER STONE QUARTZ, AND WE BUILD A SINK OUT OF THE EXTRA STONE.
YOU1000000154_S0000185	WORK THE SEAMS AND YOU ALSO HAVE THE SEAMS BUILT IN WITH THE SAME MATERIAL, RIGHT?
YOU1000000154_S0000186	THAT'S BUILDING THE SINKS AND A CABINETRY UNDERNEATH THE DRAWERS.
YOU1000000154_S0000187	IT LOOKS SO SIMPLE HERE, BUT GETTING ALL THESE DETAILS RIGHT, GETTING ALL THE CORNERS, EDGES, EVERYTHING LEVELED, IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK.
YOU1000000154_S0000188	AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A BIG MIRROR NEXT TO THE LAW AFTER WE SOLVE THAT.

YOU1000000154_S0000222	IF YOU ACTUALLY GET CLOSE TO IT, YOU CAN SEE THE SEAMS, BUT EVENTUALLY IT BLENDS INTO THE LOOK.
YOU1000000154_S0000223	YEAH, AND THEN WE DID SOME WALL SCONCES, SURROUND SOUNDS, SO THERE'S LIKE A SUBWOOFER THERE AGAIN.
YOU1000000154_S0000224	BURIED UNDER THE PANELING AND THEN A CURVED PROJECTOR SCREEN.

YOU1000000154_S0000255	YEAH, WATER, I'M ASSUMING, ARE FLOWING FROM THIS INTO THE POOL?
YOU1000000154_S0000256	YES, AND THEN THERE'S A WATERFALL OUT ON THAT SIDE TOO, YOU CAN SEE ON THE BACK SIDE.
YOU1000000154_S0000257	OKAY.
YOU1000000154_S0000258	SO NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CHECK OUT THE BACKYARD BUT I WANT MY BOY ED TO COME WITH ME. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YOU1000000154_S0000260	WELL MY LEG IS NOT WORKING SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.
YOU1000000154_S0000261	WELL, I GOT YOUR BACK.
YOU1000000154_S0000262	YOU WANNA CARRY ME DOWN THE STAIRS?
YOU1000000154_S0000264	OKAY, YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
YOU1000000154_S0000266	OH MY GOD.
YOU1000000154_S0000267	ALRIGHT, WE READY? JUST KEEP YOURSELF IN PLACE.
YOU1000000154_S0000268	THIS IS WHERE THE LAWSUIT STARTS TO HAPPEN.
YOU1000000154_S0000270	AND WE HAVE THE OWNER HERE, BUT PERFECT.
YOU1000000154_S0000271	OKAY, THAT WAS PRETTY SWEET.
YOU1000000154_S0000273	AT LEAST YOU KNOW THE STAIRS ARE BUILT IN A WAY YOU CAN CARRY SOMETHING.
YOU1000000154_S0000274	WE CAN MARRY SOMEONE.
YOU1000000154_S0000275	AND I THINK I'M GOING TO CHARGE HIM FOR HIS GYM MEMBER.
YOU1000000154_S0000277	GIVING THEM A GOOD WORKOUT. OKAY SO WE'VE JUST COME DOWN HERE TO THE BACKYARD LITERALLY WHEN WE SEE THESE LUXURY PROPERTIES IT'S ALMOST LIKE OH YEAH I'VE GOT A 20,000 SQUARE FOOT LOT BUT 90% OF IT IS LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000154_S0000278	RIGHT.
YOU1000000154_S0000279	WHICH THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T REALLY USE IT. THIS YOU ACTUALLY COME DOWN HERE THINKING THERE'S NOTHING DOWN HERE.
YOU1000000154_S0000280	YOU'VE BASICALLY GOT YOUR OWN AREA YOU CAN PUT A FOOT IN.
YOU1000000154_S0000282	THAT IS NUTS.
YOU1000000154_S0000283	THIS IS NATURAL.
YOU1000000154_S0000284	SO IT WAS LIKE THIS WHEN YOU HAD IT.
YOU1000000154_S0000285	IT WAS LIKE THIS, IT WAS JUST A LITTLE MORE GROWN IN BUT WE KIND OF CLEARED IT UP GETTING READY TO PUT SOME GRASS IN.
YOU1000000154_S0000286	WE RESTORED THE CREEK BED BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS, THIS ACTUALLY IS A NATURAL FLOOD CHANNEL THAT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN VICENTE AND THEN THE OCEAN.
YOU1000000154_S0000287	SO WE RESTORED THE CREEK BED, WE PUT A LITTLE BRIDGE.
YOU1000000154_S0000288	AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME LIGHTING IN THE TREES AND MAKE THIS LITTLE MAGICAL GARDEN AREA, OR THE MEADOW AS WE CALL IT.
YOU1000000154_S0000289	OKAY GUYS, SO THAT WRAPS UP EPISODE 2 OF LA HARD HAT TOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING. WE WANT TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS, WE WANT YOU TO SUBSCRIBE, SO WRITE THEM DOWN BELOW. ENES, WHAT DID YOU THINK?

YOU1000000155_S0000000	REAL ESTATE INVESTING RULES OF THUMB, THE 2% RULE, THE 50% RULE, AND THE 70% RULE.
YOU1000000155_S0000001	THERE ARE SOME RULES OF THUMB THAT CAN HELP INVESTORS QUICKLY SCREEN THROUGH DEALS TO MAKE A GOOD EDUCATED GUESS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURSUE THEM.
YOU1000000155_S0000002	NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT. NOTICE THAT I DIDN'T SAY THERE ARE SOME RULES OF THUMB THAT CAN HELP INVESTORS MAKE PURCHASE DECISIONS.
YOU1000000155_S0000003	BECAUSE RULES OF THUMB ARE NOT MEANT TO BE HARD AND FAST RULES. THEY SIMPLY HELP AN INVESTOR GET A QUICK AND DIRTY OPINION ON SOME VALUABLE METRICS.
YOU1000000155_S0000004	ALWAYS DO A PROPER ANALYSIS. BUT REGARDLESS, THESE RULES OF THUMB CAN COME IN REALLY HANDY IN SAVING YOU FROM ANALYZING EVERY SINGLE DEAL THAT YOU COME ACROSS.
YOU1000000155_S0000005	MY NAME IS BRANDON TURNER AND IN THIS VIDEO I'VE OUTLINED SEVERAL OF THE MOST COMMON REAL ESTATE MATH RULES OF THUMB.
YOU1000000155_S0000006	SO YOU CAN BEGIN PRACTICING THEM IN YOUR OWN ANALYSIS OF PROPERTIES.
YOU1000000155_S0000008	FIRST, THE 2% RULE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE 1% RULE OR THE 2% TEST.
YOU1000000155_S0000009	PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON RULES OF THUMB USED BY RENTAL PROPERTY INVESTORS IS KNOWN AS THE 2% RULE.
YOU1000000155_S0000010	BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S A RULE, SO I SAY 2% TEST. I LIKE THAT BETTER.
YOU1000000155_S0000011	ESSENTIALLY, THIS RULE OF THUMB LOOKS AT THE MONTHLY RENT DIVIDED BY THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IN A PERCENTAGE FORM.
YOU1000000155_S0000012	FOR THOSE WHO JUST GOT CONFUSED, LET'S MAKE THIS SUPER SIMPLE. IF A PROPERTY RENTS FOR $2,000 A MONTH,
YOU1000000155_S0000013	AND THE VALUE IS $200,000, THEN 2,000 DIVIDED BY 200,000 EQUALS 1%.
YOU1000000155_S0000014	IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE PROPERTY DOES NOT PASS THE 2% TEST, BUT IT DOES MEET THE 1% TEST. EXACTLY.
YOU1000000155_S0000015	OR, WHAT IF A PROPERTY THAT RENTS FOR $1,500 A MONTH AND IT COSTS $180,000 TO BUY? WELL, $1,500 DIVIDED BY $180,000 IS .8%.
YOU1000000155_S0000016	THAT'S DEFINITELY SHORT OF THE 1% RULE OR 1% TEST. NOW, WHAT IF THAT PROPERTY RENTS FOR $1,500 A MONTH, BUT IT'S WORTH $120,000?
YOU1000000155_S0000017	WELL, 1500 DIVIDED BY 120,000 EQUALS 1.25%. ALRIGHT, SO YOU GET HOW THE MATH WORKS NOW, RIGHT? BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
YOU1000000155_S0000018	WELL, ESSENTIALLY, THE 1% OR 2% TEST GIVES US A QUICK AND DIRTY VIEW ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PROPERTY WILL PRODUCE POSITIVE CASH FLOW.
YOU1000000155_S0000019	AND OF COURSE, JUST A RULE OF THUMB, IT ISN'T ALWAYS PRECISE, BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE HIGHER THE PERCENTAGE, THE BETTER THE CASH FLOW.
YOU1000000155_S0000020	THIS ALSO GREATLY DEPENDS ON LOCATION, PRICE, AND HOW MUCH THE EXPENSES TRULY ARE ON THE PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000021	BUT THE RULE OF THUMB CAN HELP AN INVESTOR MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURSUE A CERTAIN PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000022	FOR EXAMPLE, I KNOW THAT MOST PROPERTIES THAT FALL SHORT OF 1% WILL LIKELY NEVER PRODUCE A POSITIVE CASH FLOW FOR ME.
YOU1000000155_S0000023	IF IT'S BETWEEN 1 AND 2% IT PROBABLY WILL, AND IF IT'S ABOVE 2% WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO FIND TODAY, THEN I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THAT IT WILL.
YOU1000000155_S0000024	SO, IF MY REAL ESTATE AGENT TELLS ME THAT THEY HAVE A PERFECT RENTAL HOUSE FOR ME TO BUY, AND I SEE THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE IS $125,000,
YOU1000000155_S0000025	AND I FIND THAT IT WILL RENT FOR $1,000 A MONTH, I CAN MAKE A VERY QUICK DECISION AND I KNOW THAT, MOST LIKELY, THAT DEAL AIN'T GONNA EVER PROVIDE CASH FLOW.
YOU1000000155_S0000026	BECAUSE IT FALLS SHORT OF THE 1% RULE BECAUSE 1000 DIVIDED BY 125,000 EQUALS 0.8%.
YOU1000000155_S0000027	IN A CASE LIKE THIS, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN SPEND ANY MORE TIME LOOKING AT THE DEAL IF I WAS ONLY INTERESTED IN THE CASH FLOW.
YOU1000000155_S0000028	SO THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE 2% RULE TEST THING. WHILE THE 2% RULE AND THE 1% RULE OR TEST WE JUST MENTIONED
YOU1000000155_S0000029	THEY CAN HELP YOU GET WITH A GO, NO GO DECISION ON LOOKING FURTHER INTO A RENTAL PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000030	IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL US HOW MUCH CASH FLOW WE MIGHT EXPECT. FOR THAT, INVESTORS OFTEN RELY ON THE 50% RULE OF THUMB.
YOU1000000155_S0000031	THE 50% RULE STATES THAT ON AVERAGE AND OVER TIME, HALF OF THE INCOME IN A PROPERTY IS SPENT ON OPERATING EXPENSES.
YOU1000000155_S0000032	NOW, WHAT ARE OPERATING EXPENSES? WELL, GOOD QUESTION. OPERATING EXPENSES ARE ALL OF THE EXPENSES INVOLVED WITH RUNNING A RENTAL PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000033	EXCEPT THE LOAN PAYMENT. SO IT INCLUDES TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, REPAIRS, VACANCY, AND OTHER METRICS.
YOU1000000155_S0000034	THAT LEAVE THE LANDLORD'S CHECKING ACCOUNT EVERY SINGLE MONTH OR EVERY YEAR, DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT.
YOU1000000155_S0000035	THE 50% RULE CAN HELP AN INVESTOR QUICKLY ESTIMATE THE CASH FLOW OF A RENTAL PROPERTY BECAUSE IT COMBINES ALL OF THOSE EXPENSES, EXCEPT FOR THE LOAN, INTO ONE EASY NUMBER.
YOU1000000155_S0000037	SO, LET'S WORK THROUGH THIS. IMAGINE A PROPERTY RENTS FOR $2,000 A MONTH. THE 50% RULE SAYS HALF OF THIS, A THOUSAND, WILL BE SPENT ON EXPENSES.
YOU1000000155_S0000038	THIS MEANS WE'RE LEFT WITH A THOUSAND BUCKS, BUT NOW WE NEED TO MAKE THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT ON THIS, RIGHT? UNLESS YOU PAID CASH FOR THE PROPERTY, BUT LET'S SAY YOU DIDN'T.
YOU1000000155_S0000039	SO WITH THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS WE HAVE LEFT, LET'S SAY THE MORTGAGE IS $600. SO HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE LEFT? 400 BUCKS.
YOU1000000155_S0000040	BECAUSE 2000 TIMES 50% EQUALS 1000, 1000 MINUS 600 FOR OPERATING EXPENSES IS $400 IN CASH FLOW.
YOU1000000155_S0000041	THAT REMAINING NUMBER IS WHAT YOU CAN ESTIMATE OVER TIME ON AVERAGE YOU MIGHT GET IN MONTHLY CASH FLOW.
YOU1000000155_S0000042	OF COURSE, THAT 50% ESTIMATE ON OPERATING EXPENSES CAN REALLY VARY WILDLY DEPENDING ON THE PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000043	IN SOME AREAS, TAXES AND INSURANCE MIGHT BE INCREDIBLY HIGH, BUT IN OTHER AREAS IT MIGHT BE MUCH LOWER. SOME PROPERTIES REQUIRE THAT THE LANDLORD PAY ALL UTILITIES.
YOU1000000155_S0000044	WHERE OTHER PROPERTIES ALLOW THE TENANT TO PAY THEIR OWN. AND WHILE INHERENT WEAKNESSES DO EXIST.
YOU1000000155_S0000045	THE 50% RULE DOES HAVE VALUE. I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PROPERTY THAT RENTS FOR $1,200 A MONTH,
YOU1000000155_S0000047	AND YOU KNOW THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT WOULD BE AROUND A THOUSAND, YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT PROPERTY WILL NOT PRODUCE A POSITIVE CASH FLOW.
YOU1000000155_S0000048	BECAUSE 200 BUCKS A MONTH IS NOT A LOT OF ROOM FOR ALL THOSE EXPENSES. BECAUSE 1200 TIMES 50% EQUALS 600.
YOU1000000155_S0000049	600 MINUS A THOUSAND IS NEGATIVE 400. NOW, THE 50% RULE HELPS KEEP REAL ESTATE INVESTORS IN CHECK,
YOU1000000155_S0000050	AND TO REMIND US THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPENSES THAT OVER TIME ADD UP. YEAH, I MEAN A NEW ROOF IS ONLY NEEDED EVERY 20 YEARS.
YOU1000000155_S0000051	BUT IF YOU DIVIDE A $10,000 ROOF INTO 240 MONTHS, THAT ROOF IS ACTUALLY COSTING YOU $42 A MONTH, EVERY SINGLE MONTH.
YOU1000000155_S0000052	THESE OPERATING EXPENSES ADD UP OVER TIME, AND AS MOST INVESTORS HAVE SEEN, THEY TEND TO SETTLE AROUND 50% GIVEN A LONG ENOUGH TIME FRAME.
YOU1000000155_S0000053	OKAY ON TO THE FINAL RULE OF THUMB TODAY THE 70% RULE
YOU1000000155_S0000054	THE LAST COUPLE RULES OF THUMB THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WERE DESIGNED TO HELP RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE FLIPPERS, THE WHOLESALERS? I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU GUYS OUT.
YOU1000000155_S0000055	SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE FLIPPING HOUSES, THE 70% RULE CAN BE HELPFUL IN DETERMINING JUST HOW MUCH TO PAY FOR A PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000056	THE 70% RULE STATES THAT THE MOST YOU SHOULD PAY FOR A POTENTIAL FLIP IS 70% OF THE AFTER REPAIR VALUE, LIKE WHAT IT WOULD SELL FOR WHEN IT WAS ALL FIXED UP.
YOU1000000155_S0000057	MINUS THE REPAIR COSTS. SO EXAMPLE, IF A HOME WOULD SELL FOR 300 GRAND ALL FIXED UP AND THE PROPERTY NEEDED 50 GRAND WORTH OF WORK TO GET THERE,
YOU1000000155_S0000058	THEN, 300,000 TIMES 70% IS 210,000. SUBTRACT OUT THAT $50,000 AND YOU'RE LEFT WITH 160K.
YOU1000000155_S0000059	ACCORDING TO THE 70% RULE, THE MOST SOMEONE SHOULD PAY FOR THAT PROPERTY WOULD BE $160K. BUT OF COURSE, THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE 70% RULE.
YOU1000000155_S0000060	THIS RULE OF THUMB ASSUMES THAT 30% OF THE ARV, THE AFTER REPAIR VALUE, IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON HOLDING COSTS, ON CLOTHING COSTS, ON THE BUYING SIDE, THE SELLING SIDE.
YOU1000000155_S0000061	COMMISSIONS, TAXES, ATTORNEY FEES, TITLE COMPANY FEES AND MORE, AND THE FLIPPERS PROFIT AND ANY OTHER CHARGES THAT COME UP DURING THE DEAL. NOW THIS WORKS WELL IN SOME MARKETS,
YOU1000000155_S0000062	BUT IT HAS SOME SEVERE LIMITATIONS.
YOU1000000155_S0000063	FOR EXAMPLE, THE 70% RULE DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WELL FOR A PROPERTY WITH A REALLY LOW ARV, AFTER REPAIR VALUE.
YOU1000000155_S0000064	SUCH AS $50,000. AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE 30% DEDUCTED FROM THE ARV INCLUDES THE HOLDING COSTS AND THE CLOSING COSTS, AS WELL AS THE PROFIT
YOU1000000155_S0000065	THE INVESTOR OR THE FLIPPER WANTS TO MAKE. HOWEVER, LIKE 30% OF 50 GRAND IS LIKE $15,000. SO FOLLOWING THE 70% RULE,
YOU1000000155_S0000066	ALL OF THE FEES, COST, AND PROFIT WOULD ONLY BE $15,000.
YOU1000000155_S0000067	IF THE FEES AND HOLDING COSTS WERE TO TOTAL LIKE 10 GRAND, THAT WOULD LEAVE JUST $5,000 IN PROFIT FOR THE HOUSE FLIPPER.
YOU1000000155_S0000068	AND I DON'T KNOW ANY HOUSE FLIPPER WHO'S GOING TO TAKE ON THE RISK OF FLIPPING A HOUSE FOR JUST FIVE GRAND.
YOU1000000155_S0000069	SO, FOLLOWING THE 70% RULE, A FLIPPER OR WHOLESALER WOULD PAY FAR TOO MUCH FOR THE PROPERTY IN THIS EXAMPLE.
YOU1000000155_S0000070	AND INVESTOR FLIPPING HOUSES AT THIS LEVEL MIGHT REQUIRE FAR LESS THAN 70%, MAYBE A 50% OR EVEN LOWER.
YOU1000000155_S0000071	NOW, A SIMILAR PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THE 70% RULE FOR MORE EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES.
YOU1000000155_S0000072	THE 70% RULE WOULD DICTATE THAT A HOME WITH AN ARV OF 700 GRAND THAT NEEDS 50 GRAND TO WORK
YOU1000000155_S0000073	SHOULD PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OFFER OF $440,000.
YOU1000000155_S0000074	BUT, IN MOST MARKETS, FINDING A $700,000 PROPERTY FOR $440,000 IS SIMPLY NOT FEASIBLE.
YOU1000000155_S0000075	A PERSON WHO STICKS EXCLUSIVELY TO THAT 70% RULE ARE LIKELY NEVER GOING TO FIND A GOOD ENOUGH DEAL TO EVER FLIP A SINGLE PROPERTY IN THAT MARKET.
YOU1000000155_S0000076	IN THIS CASE, 80% OR EVEN 85% MIGHT BE GOOD ENOUGH.
YOU1000000155_S0000077	FURTHERMORE, SOME INVESTORS MAY SPEND MORE OR LESS ON FEES AND COSTS BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICULAR LIFE SITUATION OR LOCATION.
YOU1000000155_S0000078	FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME STATES, PURCHASING A HOME MAY REQUIRE THREE GRAND IN CLOSING COSTS, WHILE IN OTHER STATES IT MIGHT BE $6,000.
YOU1000000155_S0000079	SOME INVESTORS MAY HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE, WHICH SAVES THEM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN COMMISSIONS.
YOU1000000155_S0000080	WHEREAS, OTHER INVESTORS, WELL, THEY MAY NEED TO PAY COMMISSIONS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SELL THE PROPERTY. SO, HOW SHOULD THE 70% RULE BE VALUED?
YOU1000000155_S0000081	WELL, CAREFULLY. IT'S A QUICK AND DIRTY WAY TO GUESSTIMATE THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNT YOU SHOULD PAY FOR A PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000082	BUT, AS WITH ALL RULES OF THUMB, NO CONCRETE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE UNLESS YOU'VE RUN A REAL ESTATE ANALYSIS ON THE PROPERTY.
YOU1000000155_S0000083	AND OF COURSE, IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT, CHECK OUT THE BIGGERPOCKETS SUITE OF CALCULATORS. YOU CAN GET THEM AT BIGGERPOCKETS.COM FORWARD SLASH CALC, C A L C.

YOU1000000156_S0000001	NICHOLAS MANZO.
YOU1000000156_S0000003	MORNING, SIR.
YOU1000000156_S0000005	MR. MANZO.
YOU1000000156_S0000006	YEAH
YOU1000000156_S0000007	YOU HAVE A RED LIGHT VIOLATION.
YOU1000000156_S0000008	YEAH.
YOU1000000156_S0000009	ON PLEASANT VALLEY PARKWAY. DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?
YOU1000000156_S0000011	WELL, IN FACT, I WENT AND INVESTIGATED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES. I WAS WRONG, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I MADE A RIGHT HAND TURN AND
YOU1000000156_S0000013	THAT'S THE FIRST VIOLATION I'VE GOTTEN IN 72 YEARS OF DRIVING.
YOU1000000156_S0000015	REALLY?
YOU1000000156_S0000016	YEP, LOOK UP MY RECORD.
YOU1000000156_S0000017	I'M GONNA LOOK IT UP.
YOU1000000156_S0000019	NOW, MR. MEZZO, I'LL ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YOU1000000156_S0000021	INDICATES THAT YOU ARE 93 YEARS OLD.
YOU1000000156_S0000022	RIGHT?
YOU1000000156_S0000024	WORLD WAR II VETERAN.
YOU1000000156_S0000026	SPENT 29 MONTHS IN THE PACIFIC, OKAY, WITHOUT COMING BACK. AND CAME BACK ALIVE.
YOU1000000156_S0000027	WHERE WERE YOU IN THE
YOU1000000156_S0000028	I WAS IN THE NAVY.
YOU1000000156_S0000029	EVEN THE NAVY.
YOU1000000156_S0000030	YEP.
YOU1000000156_S0000032	HOW LONG DID YOU SERVE?
YOU1000000156_S0000033	I SERVED THREE YEARS, 1943 FEBRUARY ON MY 17TH BIRTHDAY. I JOINED THE NAVY AND I DIDN'T COME BACK FOR THREE YEARS.
YOU1000000156_S0000035	THE TRUTH OF THE STORY IS, I CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY IF YOU'VE GOT A FEW MINUTES.
YOU1000000156_S0000036	I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
YOU1000000156_S0000037	I JOINED THE NAVY WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD. I WENT UP TO FEDERAL HILL, HOLY GHOST CHURCH. I GOT MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I FORGED IT.
YOU1000000156_S0000038	I MADE MYSELF 17 YEARS OLD AND I WENT DOWN TO THE RECRUITING STATION, I JOINED THE NAVY, EVERYTHING WENT FINE.
YOU1000000156_S0000039	UNTIL TWO WEEKS LATER THE POLICEMEN AND THE NAVY COME UP AND THEY WANTED TO ARREST ME BECAUSE I FORGED MY FIRST CERTIFICATE.
YOU1000000156_S0000041	BUT I WAITED ANOTHER YEAR AND I LEFT MOUNT PLEASANT HIGH SCHOOL AND I WENT IN THE NAVY. AND I SPENT THREE YEARS, 29 MONTHS IN THE PACIFIC.
YOU1000000156_S0000043	EVERY BATTLE THAT WAS IN THE PACIFIC I WAS THERE. I WAS IN IT.
YOU1000000156_S0000044	I RECEIVE LETTERS FROM PEOPLE EVERY DAY AND I RECEIVED A NUMBER OF LETTERS FROM VETERANS WHO ACTUALLY SEND ME CHECKS.
YOU1000000156_S0000045	AND THE PURPOSE FOR THEM SENDING ME CHECKS IS TO HELP OTHER VETERANS.
YOU1000000156_S0000047	NOW
YOU1000000156_S0000049	I WOULD REALLY DISMISS YOUR CASE OUTRIGHT ANYWAY.
YOU1000000156_S0000051	YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000156_S0000052	I WOULD DISMISS IT. AND IT'S NOT GONNA GO ON YOUR RECORD, BUT I'M NOT GONNA HAVE YOU PAY ANYTHING OF THIS.
YOU1000000156_S0000053	BUT I HAVE A GENTLEMAN WHO SENT ME A CHECK FOR $50 AND HE WANTS TO...
YOU1000000156_S0000055	HE WANTS ME TO, HE SAID HIS FATHER WAS A WORLD WAR II NAVY VETERAN.
YOU1000000156_S0000057	AND PLEASE USE THIS TO HONOR HIM AND HIS SERVICE AS A VETERAN. AND YOU WERE A WORLD WAR II NAVY VETERAN AS WELL.
YOU1000000156_S0000058	SO I'M GOING TO USE THIS CHECK. THIS IS FROM ANTHONY CHRISTENSEN.
YOU1000000156_S0000060	AND MR. CHRISTENSEN IS FROM, LOOKS LIKE PANHANDLE, TEXAS. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES DURING THE WAR.
YOU1000000156_S0000061	WELL, I WAS ON BOARD SHIP.
YOU1000000156_S0000063	A BIG SHIP.
YOU1000000156_S0000065	BATTLESHIP AND WE WERE IN MANY, MANY
YOU1000000156_S0000067	BATTLES, MANY OF THEM. THE WORST ONE I'VE SEEN WAS IWO JIMA.
YOU1000000156_S0000069	THAT WAS A...
YOU1000000156_S0000071	THAT WAS TERRIBLE. WE LOST MORE MARINES IN THAT INVASION.
YOU1000000156_S0000073	AND I THINK ANY OTHER WAR OUTSIDE OF THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE.
YOU1000000156_S0000075	YOU COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD THAT WAS.

YOU1000000156_S0000088	AND YOU WERE THE GREATEST GENERATION. AND YOU SAID SOMETHING EARLIER.
YOU1000000156_S0000090	SECOND WORLD WAR BROUGHT ABOUT A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE.
YOU1000000156_S0000091	RIGHT.
YOU1000000156_S0000092	BUT THERE WAS SUCH STRONG PATRIOTISM THAT HERE YOU WERE A 16 YEAR OLD BOY AND YOU WANTED TO GO AND FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY.
YOU1000000156_S0000093	SO MUCH SO THAT YOU EVEN FORGED A DOCUMENT TO TRY TO GET INTO THE SERVICE TO GO AND PROTECT THE COUNTRY.
YOU1000000156_S0000094	AND I GOT CAUGHT.
YOU1000000156_S0000096	BUT YOU WENT BACK.
YOU1000000156_S0000097	I WENT BACK A YEAR LATER, RIGHT ON MY BIRTHDAY, I JOINED THE NAVY.

YOU1000000156_S0000106	AND HE WAS THERE FOR 18 MONTHS AND HE SURVIVED. HE CAME HOME.
YOU1000000156_S0000108	CITIZEN.
YOU1000000156_S0000109	THEY SHOULD BUILD A MONUMENT TO YOUR FAMILY BETWEEN YOUR FATHER IN WORLD WAR I AND YOU AND ALL YOUR COUSINS.
YOU1000000156_S0000110	MY KNUCKLES.
YOU1000000156_S0000111	AND YOUR UNCLES IN WORLD WAR II. UNBELIEVABLE, AND THEY ALL CAME BACK.
YOU1000000156_S0000113	WE ALL CAME BACK, YEAH, EVERY ONE OF US.
YOU1000000156_S0000114	I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR SERVICE.
YOU1000000156_S0000116	AND THAT 93 JUDGE, HE'S GOT A WONDERFUL HEAD OF HAIR TOO. I GOTTA COMMEND HIM FOR THAT.
YOU1000000156_S0000117	WELL, I REMEMBER WHEN THE JUDGE HAD A NICE HAT I HAD.
YOU1000000156_S0000118	I'LL BE STILL GOING.
YOU1000000156_S0000120	HE STILL DOES.
YOU1000000156_S0000122	WE COULD BRING BACK THEM OLD DAYS, HUH?
YOU1000000156_S0000123	THEY WERE WONDERFUL DAYS. THESE ARE WONDERFUL DAYS TOO, EXCEPT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE SENSE OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY THAT WE HAD BACK THEN.

YOU1000000157_S0000011	YOU DON'T? OH.
YOU1000000157_S0000012	I PUT ALL MY MONEY UP UNDER THE BED.
YOU1000000157_S0000013	WHO DO YOU LIVE WITH?
YOU1000000157_S0000014	MY GIRL.
YOU1000000157_S0000015	OH, DID SHE GIVE YOU SOME MONEY THIS MORNING?
YOU1000000157_S0000017	NAH, SHE WANTS MONEY, SHE TAKES MONEY FROM ME.
YOU1000000157_S0000019	DOES SHE WORK?
YOU1000000157_S0000020	I'LL PAY HER.
YOU1000000157_S0000021	OH, YOU'RE SUPPORTING HER? OH, I SEE. WELL, COMING FROM YOUR RESIDENCE...
YOU1000000157_S0000023	IT WAS LOUD MUSIC.
YOU1000000157_S0000024	YES, SIR. I'VE BEEN THERE 15 YEARS.
YOU1000000157_S0000026	HOLD ON FOR A MINUTE. POLICE COULD HEAR THE MUSIC FROM OUTSIDE AND THEY ISSUED YOU A $200 FINE.
YOU1000000157_S0000027	SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS?
YOU1000000157_S0000028	WELL, I'VE BEEN THERE 15 YEARS, NO PROBLEM. WE GOT NEW NEIGHBORS THAT MOVED IN AND THEY CALLED THE COPS ON ME. THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR. I WOULD HAVE TURNED THE MUSIC DOWN.
YOU1000000157_S0000030	WAS IT A RADIO OR WAS IT A...
YOU1000000157_S0000031	OH, IT WAS THE RADIO.
YOU1000000157_S0000032	RADIO.
YOU1000000157_S0000033	YOU HAVE THE AMPLIFIERS.
YOU1000000157_S0000034	YES, SIR.
YOU1000000157_S0000035	YEAH, THEY'RE BOTH FIRES.
YOU1000000157_S0000036	YEAH.
YOU1000000157_S0000037	WHAT TIME OF DAY WAS IT?
YOU1000000157_S0000038	I THINK IT WAS ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK.
YOU1000000157_S0000039	AT NIGHT?
YOU1000000157_S0000040	YES, SIR.
YOU1000000157_S0000041	YEAH.
YOU1000000157_S0000043	MR. CRAWFORD, I HAVE A SUMMONS BEFORE ME.
YOU1000000157_S0000045	THAT INDICATES THAT ON APRIL 27TH THAT
YOU1000000157_S0000047	THERE WAS ALL MUSIC COMING FROM YOUR RESIDENCE.
YOU1000000157_S0000048	IT DOES NOT SAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000050	THE TIME.
YOU1000000157_S0000052	SO THE SUMMONS IS INCOMPLETE.
YOU1000000157_S0000054	MY PHILOSOPHY IS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE ENTITLED
YOU1000000157_S0000056	TO THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE LAW, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE AN EXPERIENCED ATTORNEY OR NOT. SO IF YOU CAME HERE WITH AN ATTORNEY TODAY, AN ATTORNEY WOULD MAKE A MOTION TO DISMISS.
YOU1000000157_S0000057	BECAUSE THE SUMMONS IS INCOMPLETE. NOW, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A LAWYER, BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THE LAW ENFORCED ON YOUR BEHALF.
YOU1000000157_S0000058	BUT I KNOW THAT AND IT WOULD BE IMMORAL IF I FIND YOU WHEN THE SUMMONS IS INCOMPLETE. SO I'M GOING TO DISMISS IT.
YOU1000000157_S0000059	THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
YOU1000000157_S0000060	WITH THE PROMISE FROM YOU THAT KEEP THE MUSIC DOWN, RIGHT?
YOU1000000157_S0000061	OKAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000062	WHAT WERE YOU DOING? WERE YOU DANCING WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND? WHAT WAS GOING ON?
YOU1000000157_S0000063	YEAH, I HAD A LITTLE DISCO BALL IN MY HOUSE, AND YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000157_S0000065	I JUST TURNED TO MUSIC WHEN I DIDN'T REALIZE.
YOU1000000157_S0000066	LET ME SEE YOUR BEST MOVE. LET ME SEE YOUR BEST MOVE.
YOU1000000157_S0000067	GIVE HIM THE GRAPE STREET SLIDE.
YOU1000000157_S0000069	THERE YOU GO.
YOU1000000157_S0000071	THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
YOU1000000157_S0000073	GOOD MORNING.
YOU1000000157_S0000074	CAROLINE, YOU'VE BEEN HERE SO LONG, IT'S AFTERNOON.
YOU1000000157_S0000076	EXCUSE ME, I GOT UP AT 5 A.M. AND DROVE THROUGH THREE HOURS OF BOSTON TRAFFIC BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN MY INNOCENCE AND I PLEAD NOT GUILTY.
YOU1000000157_S0000078	BY PLEADING NOT GUILTY, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU WANNA COME BACK AND HAVE A TRIAL.
YOU1000000157_S0000079	NO, OKAY, THEN I DON'T PLEAD NOT GUILTY. CAN YOU LOOK AT MY SUMMONS?
YOU1000000157_S0000080	YEAH, LOOK AT THOSE SUMMONS.
YOU1000000157_S0000081	BASED ON WHAT I BELIEVE YOU EXPLAINED, IT'S CALLED...
YOU1000000157_S0000082	CAROLINE I DON'T HEAR A WORD YOU SAY UNLESS YOU SPEAK
YOU1000000157_S0000083	BASED ON WHAT I BELIEVE I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER, IT'S A FAULTY SUMMONS?
YOU1000000157_S0000084	REALLY?
YOU1000000157_S0000085	WELL, MAYBE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU1000000157_S0000086	EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.
YOU1000000157_S0000087	BECAUSE THE BECAUSE
YOU1000000157_S0000089	UM...
YOU1000000157_S0000091	I'M
YOU1000000157_S0000092	THE SPEED I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DRIVING AT IS NOT POSTED.
YOU1000000157_S0000093	OH, YOU EARNED THAT.
YOU1000000157_S0000094	THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD.
YOU1000000157_S0000095	YOU WERE LISTENING.
YOU1000000157_S0000096	I WAS LISTENING.
YOU1000000157_S0000098	EVERY SINGLE WORD I SAID. AND YOU SAID, I WONDER IF ANY OF THIS APPLIES TO ME.
YOU1000000157_S0000099	NO, I STILL BELIEVED IN MY INNOCENCE BEFORE THAT.
YOU1000000157_S0000100	WELL, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
YOU1000000157_S0000101	WELL, I CAME BACK AND WENT TO THE SCHOOL AND RECREATED THE SCENE AND TOOK FILM AT NIGHT.
YOU1000000157_S0000102	I USED TO BE A SCHOOL TEACHER AND IT'S VERY, VERY HARD TO SEE THE SPEED LIMIT AT THAT LOCATION. THERE'S NO SPEED LIMIT IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL.
YOU1000000157_S0000103	THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE SIGNS.
YOU1000000157_S0000105	WELL, THE FIRST THING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS STOP LECTURING THE JUDGE.
YOU1000000157_S0000106	I'M SORRY.
YOU1000000157_S0000107	ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BECAUSE SOME JUDGES GET VERY UPSET.
YOU1000000157_S0000108	NO, IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO DO THAT ANYWAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000109	OH, GOOD. IT'S NOT MY JOB.
YOU1000000157_S0000110	NO.
YOU1000000157_S0000112	BE CAREFUL, HE'S A TOUGH GUY.
YOU1000000157_S0000114	OKAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000115	HE'S ON THE SWAT TEAM.
YOU1000000157_S0000116	FIRST GUYS OUT THERE WITH THE BIG GUNS.
YOU1000000157_S0000117	NO, JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE KIDS.
YOU1000000157_S0000118	OH, I SEE.
YOU1000000157_S0000120	LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT'S GOING ON WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.
YOU1000000157_S0000122	THEY JUST BEGAN THIS SYSTEM. AND THE FIRST WAVE OF SUMMONSES THAT WENT OUT, THERE WERE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM.
YOU1000000157_S0000123	THAT DID NOT INDICATE THE SPEED LIMIT IN THE SMALL BOX WHERE THE PRINT IS BIG.
YOU1000000157_S0000125	AND THEY INDICATED THE SPEED LIMIT UP AT THE TOP OF THE SUMMONS, YOU CAN'T SEE IT. YOU LITERALLY NEED A MAGNIFYING GLASS TO SEE IT.
YOU1000000157_S0000127	SO I HAVE TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THE SUMMONS WAS INADEQUATE FOR THE CITY TO PREVAIL. THERE'S SUCH A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE POWER OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE POWER OF THE SOVEREIGN THAT THEY SHOULD GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.
YOU1000000157_S0000128	I TAKE THAT.
YOU1000000157_S0000129	THANK YOU.
YOU1000000157_S0000130	UNLESS IT'S A CRIME OF MORAL TURPITUDE, THEN I THINK, AND THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED. BUT THESE ARE SPEEDING TICKETS.
YOU1000000157_S0000131	I'M NOT CONDONING SPEEDING, BUT I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD AFFORD ALL OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
YOU1000000157_S0000132	THANK YOU.
YOU1000000157_S0000133	EVEN THOUGH.
YOU1000000157_S0000135	EVEN THOUGH YOU COME FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
YOU1000000157_S0000136	NO, BUT I GREW UP IN RHODE ISLAND.
YOU1000000157_S0000137	WHERE?
YOU1000000157_S0000138	I GREW UP IN JOHNSTON, I WENT TO ST. MARY'S ACADEMY WITH A VISITATION IN PROVIDENCE, AND MY FATHER'S HERE IN A NURSING HOME AND THAT'S WHY I WAS HERE.
YOU1000000157_S0000139	OH, OKAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000141	I'M A RHODE ISLANDER.
YOU1000000157_S0000142	OKAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000143	I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MATTERS.
YOU1000000157_S0000144	IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT.
YOU1000000157_S0000145	CHEERS.
YOU1000000157_S0000146	BUT BASED ON THE SUMMONS, THE SUMMONS WAS INCOMPLETE.
YOU1000000157_S0000147	OKAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000148	SO THE MATTER'S GONNA BE DISMISSED.
YOU1000000157_S0000149	THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU1000000157_S0000150	GOOD WORK.
YOU1000000157_S0000151	I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.
YOU1000000157_S0000153	EVERYBODY SAYS THAT.
YOU1000000157_S0000154	NO, I'M OKAY.
YOU1000000157_S0000155	THEN THEY COME BACK THE FOLLOWING WEEK.
YOU1000000157_S0000156	THANK YOU.

YOU1000000158_S0000008	YES, I WORK FOR A STAFFING AGENCY. I'M A RECRUITER.
YOU1000000158_S0000010	MY EXPLANATION TO THOSE TICKETS, I DEALT WITH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP.
YOU1000000158_S0000013	RUNNING AWAY FROM SOMEBODY THAT USED TO CHASE ME WITH MY DAUGHTER.

YOU1000000158_S0000036	ONE MINUTE.
YOU1000000158_S0000037	I'M TRYING TO DETERMINE WHY YOU WOULD GO THROUGH NINE RED LIGHTS, OKAY?
YOU1000000158_S0000038	I MEAN, WERE YOU BEING PURSUED BY SOMEBODY OR WERE YOU JUST...
YOU1000000158_S0000039	YEAH.
YOU1000000158_S0000041	JUDGE DAINEY CHECKED ON THAT. HE SAID THERE WAS A COUPLE OF REPORTS OR SOMETHING THAT THERE WAS SOME DAMAGE DONE TO A VEHICLE AND STUFF LIKE THAT, BUT HE GOES, HE DOESN'T THINK ALL OF THEM.

YOU1000000158_S0000052	RIGHT.
YOU1000000158_S0000053	AND SOME MAYBE BECAUSE OF A STATE OF MIND THAT YOU HAD COULD HAVE HAD SOME EFFECT ON YOUR DRIVING, BUT CERTAINLY NOT ALL OF THESE, OKAY, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THEM.

YOU1000000158_S0000083	GENEROSITY OF A SECOND.

YOU1000000158_S0000087	THESE PEOPLE ARE BOTH IMMIGRANTS AND THEY WANT TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS IN NEED.
YOU1000000158_S0000088	SO WE'RE GONNA USE THAT $75 CHECK FOR YOU AS WELL. SO THAT'S $175.
YOU1000000158_S0000090	I HAVE A CHECK FROM

YOU1000000159_S0000001	2020 HAS BEEN A YEAR, BUT THANKFULLY IT WAS A PRETTY GREAT YEAR FOR VIDEO GAMES. IGN SCORED MORE GAMES AS MASTERPIECES THAN ANY OTHER YEAR FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES.
YOU1000000159_S0000002	THOUGH OF COURSE IT WASN'T ALL 10S AND GOLD STARS. WE ALSO RATED MORE GAMES IN ONE YEAR AT A 3 OR LOWER, THAT'S AWFUL OR WORSE, THAN WE HAVE IN A WHILE.
YOU1000000159_S0000003	SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, HERE ARE IGN'S BEST AND WORST REVIEWED GAMES OF 2020.
YOU1000000159_S0000005	CRUSADER KINGS 3 IS A SUPERB STRATEGY GAME, A GREAT RPG, AND A MASTERCLASS IN HOW TO TAKE THE BEST PARTS OF AN EXISTING SYSTEM AND MAKE THEM DEEPER AND BETTER.
YOU1000000159_S0000006	I HAVE THOUSANDS OF HOURS IN THE PREVIOUS GAME, AND I EXPECT TO SPEND AT LEAST THAT MANY IN THIS THIRD INSTALLMENT.
YOU1000000159_S0000007	ALL OF THE ENGROSSINGLY FLAWED CHARACTERS AND STORIES OF LOVE, WAR, TRIUMPH, AND LOSS THAT HAVE ALREADY DYNAMICALLY EMERGED FROM MY PLAYTHROUGHS FEEL LIKE JUST THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING LEGENDARY.
YOU1000000159_S0000008	IN FACT, IF I HAD TO PICK ONLY ONE GAME TO PLAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, THE DECISION WOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT.
YOU1000000159_S0000009	A NEW KING OF HISTORICAL STRATEGY HAS BEEN CROWNED. LONG LIVE THE KING!
YOU1000000159_S0000011	BACK WHEN VR FIRST BECAME A REAL THING AND WE ALL STARTED SPITBALLING ABOUT WHICH GAME WORLDS WE'D MOST LIKE TO BE FULLY IMMERSED IN, HALF LIFE TOPPED MY LIST, TIED WITH BIOSHOCK.
YOU1000000159_S0000012	IT TOOK A FEW YEARS, BUT HALF LIFE ALYX HAS REALIZED THAT POTENTIAL, AND IT'S THE BEST VR SHOOTER I'VE EVER PLAYED.
YOU1000000159_S0000013	WITH IT, VALVE HAS SET A NEW BAR FOR VR INTERACTIVITY, DETAIL, AND LEVEL DESIGN, SHOWING WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN A WORLD CLASS DEVELOPER GOES ALL IN ON THE NEW FRONTIER OF TECHNOLOGY.
YOU1000000159_S0000014	IN A LOT OF WAYS IT FEELS LIKE A GAME FROM THE FUTURE, AND ONE THAT THE REST OF VR GAMING WILL LIKELY TAKE A GOOD LONG WHILE TO MATCH, MUCH LESS SURPASS.
YOU1000000159_S0000016	THE LAST OF US PART II IS A MASTERPIECE WORTHY OF ITS PREDECESSOR. TAKING STRIDES FORWARD IN NEARLY EVERY WAY,
YOU1000000159_S0000017	ELLIE STEPS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT AND CARRIES THE SEQUEL IN A MANNER THAT FEELS LIKE THE CULMINATION OF EVERYTHING THAT'S MADE NAUGHTY DOG'S BLOCKBUSTER STORYTELLING SO MEMORABLE.
YOU1000000159_S0000019	IT DELIVERS A LAYERED, EMOTIONALLY SHATTERING STORY ON TOP OF STEALTH AND ACTION GAMEPLAY THAT IMPROVES THE FIRST GAME'S MECHANICS WHILE INTEGRATING A BIT MORE OF UNCHARTED'S GREATER MOBILITY AND ACTION.
YOU1000000159_S0000020	BUT WHILE PART 2 IS A THRILLING ADVENTURE, IT STILL MAKES TIME FOR A STUNNING, NUANCED EXPLORATION OF THE STRENGTH AND FRAGILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT.
YOU1000000159_S0000021	THE PLAYSTATION 4 HAS ONE OF ITS FINEST EXCLUSIVES IN ONE OF THE GENERATION'S BEST GAMES.
YOU1000000159_S0000023	MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR IS LEGITIMATELY INCREDIBLE. IT'S DIFFICULT TO FULLY DESCRIBE HOW AMAZING IT FEELS TO JUMP INTO A PLANE AND JUST FLY TO AND FROM LITERALLY ANY PLACE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
YOU1000000159_S0000024	THE BASE GAME'S 20 INCLUDED AIRCRAFT FEEL LIKE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR EVEN HARDCORE AVIATION ENTHUSIASTS.
YOU1000000159_S0000025	AND THE ABILITY TO TAILOR THE EXPERIENCE TO WHATEVER SKILL LEVEL YOU DESIRE MAKES IT SUITABLE FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO FLY THE FRIENDLY SKIES FROM THE COMFORT OF THEIR HOMES.
YOU1000000159_S0000026	THE REAL WORLD MAPPING DATA HOWEVER, TAKES FLIGHT SIMULATOR FROM BEING JUST AN IMPRESSIVE GAME TO THE MOST
YOU1000000159_S0000028	AND LIMITLESS SIMULATION I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.
YOU1000000159_S0000030	SEEING FAMOUS LANDMARKS LANDING AT THE WORLD'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE AIRPORTS OR JUST TOUCHING DOWN IN A REMOTE LANDING STRIP IN SOUTH AMERICA IS MIND BOGGLINGLY COOL!
YOU1000000159_S0000031	AND AN ABSOLUTELY UNPARALLELED WAY TO VIRTUALLY EXPLORE OUR WORLD.
YOU1000000159_S0000033	OVERWATCH IS A ONE OF A KIND HERO SHOOTER THAT IS FAR AND AWAY THE BEST OF ITS GENRE. IT OFFERS VARIETY, DEPTH AND STYLE THAT VERY FEW COME CLOSE TO MATCHING.
YOU1000000159_S0000034	ITS FOUR YEAR OLD FOUNDATION HAS BEEN LOVINGLY CRAFTED INTO THE UNPARALLELED MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE THAT IT OFFERS TODAY. FROM ITS NOW CHERISHED CHARACTERS, EXPERTLY CRAFTED MAPS,
YOU1000000159_S0000035	AN OUTSTANDING SOUND DESIGN, IT'S A MASTERPIECE OF COMPETITIVE GAMEPLAY. MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL THOUGH, IT'S NEVER STOPPED BEING RIDICULOUSLY FUN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
YOU1000000159_S0000036	ALL OF THESE FACTORS COMBINE TO MAKE OVERWATCH A SINGULARLY SPECIAL SHOOTER, AND ONE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WITHOUT HESITATION.
YOU1000000159_S0000038	PERSONA 5 WAS ALREADY A STRONG FRONTRUNNER FOR BEING THE BEST JRPG EVER MADE, AND ROYAL REALLY GETS ME WONDERING WHAT ELSE COULD EVEN COMPETE.
YOU1000000159_S0000039	THE EXCELLENT STORY AND ITS LOVABLE MULTI DIMENSIONAL CHARACTERS ALONG WITH THE CHALLENGING TACTICAL COMBAT ARE ALL REFINED AND BACK FOR ANOTHER ROUND WITH NEW SURPRISES AND NEW FRIENDS IN TOW.
YOU1000000159_S0000040	THERE ARE NEW AREAS TO EXPLORE AND NEW TWISTS TO LEAVE YOUR JAW ON THE FLOOR. VERY LITTLE HAS BEEN LEFT UNTOUCHED AND JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN TOUCHED IS BETTER OFF FOR IT.
YOU1000000159_S0000041	THE PHANTOM THIEVES HAVE STOLEN MY HEART ALL OVER AGAIN, AND I DON'T REALLY WANT IT BACK.
YOU1000000159_S0000042	I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WANTED OUT OF A SEQUEL OF SPELUNKY, GIVEN HOW HIGH OF A PEDESTAL I KEEP THE ORIGINAL GAME ON. HOW DO YOU IMPROVE UPON A GAME LIKE THAT?
YOU1000000159_S0000043	BUT MOSSMOUTH TOOK ITS TIME AND MANAGED TO DELIVER A MASTERPIECE THAT IMPROVES UPON ITS PREDECESSOR IN WAYS I NEVER WOULD HAVE EVEN IMAGINED.
YOU1000000159_S0000044	SPELUNKY 2 TAKES EVERYTHING THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL GREAT AND EXPANDS UPON EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL ASPECTS WITHOUT EVER OVERCOMPLICATING THE ELEGANT, RETRO SIMPLICITY OF ITS 2D PLATFORMING.
YOU1000000159_S0000045	THE POSSIBILITIES FOR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOURSELF, YOUR ENEMIES, AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE VIRTUALLY LIMITLESS.
YOU1000000159_S0000046	WHICH IS A PART OF WHAT MAKES EVERY NEW RUN IN SPELUNKY 2 SO UNPREDICTABLE AND EXCITING. IT DOESN'T DO MUCH TO WIN OVER THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WEREN'T FANS OF THE ORIGINAL'S UNFORGIVING DIFFICULTY, BUT AS SOMEONE WHO IS MORE THAN 200 RUNS IN,
YOU1000000159_S0000048	AND FEELS LIKE HE'S ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE. SPELUNKY 2 IS A GAME THAT I SEE MYSELF PLAYING FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.
YOU1000000159_S0000050	MAN, THOSE WERE GREAT! OF COURSE, THERE'S NO ALPHA WITHOUT THE OMEGA, SO...
YOU1000000159_S0000051	COOKING MAMA COOKSTAR IS BOGGED DOWN BY MONOTONY, POOR MOTION CONTROLS, AND NIGHTMARISH VOICE ACTING, WHILE ALSO HAVING PRACTICALLY NOTHING NEW TO OFFER.
YOU1000000159_S0000052	WHETHER IT'S THE LACK OF CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILURE, THE INCESSANTLY OBNOXIOUS MAMA, THE BLAND COOKING MINIGAMES, THE LACKLUSTER MULTIPLAYER MODES, OR THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF MEANINGFUL PROGRESSION
YOU1000000159_S0000053	COOKING MAMA COOKSTAR IS A TEDIOUS GAME THAT DOES ALMOST NOTHING WELL.
YOU1000000159_S0000054	GOING INTO FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES REMASTERED EDITION, WE EXPECTED A FAIR AMOUNT OF OLD SCHOOL DESIGN AND WEREN'T SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE STORY HAD BEEN ALTERED.
YOU1000000159_S0000055	BUT WE NEVER ANTICIPATED IT WOULD BE IN SUCH A FRUSTRATINGLY POOR TECHNICAL STATE ON PLAYSTATION 4.
YOU1000000159_S0000056	UNACCEPTABLE LOAD TIMES, LACK OF LOCAL CO OP, AND AN ARCANE MATCHMAKING SYSTEM MAKES PLAYING FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES A CHORE.
YOU1000000159_S0000057	A FEW SIMPLE QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS, EVEN IF IT WAS JUST THE REMOVAL OR SHORTENING OF LOAD TIMES, WOULD HAVE GONE A LONG WAY TO GLOSS OVER AT LEAST SOME OF CRYSTAL CHRONICLES' SHORTCOMINGS WHEN COMPARED TO MANY OTHER DUNGEON CRAWLERS YOU CAN PLAY IN 2020.
YOU1000000159_S0000058	UNFORTUNATELY, THE OLD SCHOOL FRUSTRATIONS THAT WEREN'T ADDRESSED ONLY SERVE TO DATE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT, ALMOST COMPLETELY DEPRIVING IT OF ANY SORT OF FUN.
YOU1000000159_S0000059	WE'LL BE UNINSTALLING IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND NEVER LOOKING BACK.
YOU1000000159_S0000061	ASIDE FROM UP TO DATE SQUADS, THIS SEASON'S KITS AND A NEW START SCREEN, FIFA 21 ON SWITCH IS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM FIFA 20.
YOU1000000159_S0000062	WHICH WAS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM FIFA 19 BEFORE IT AND OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED AT $49.99 OR £44.99. IF LAST YEAR'S RELEASE WAS BORDERLINE INSULTING,
YOU1000000159_S0000063	THIS YEAR'S IS JUST PLAIN DISGRACEFUL. EA, PLEASE DO BETTER.
YOU1000000159_S0000065	UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU PLAY WAKING. IF YOU WANT GUIDED MEDITATION, THERE'S PLENTY OF FREE APPS FOR PHONES AND VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE.
YOU1000000159_S0000066	IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AS SOULS LIKE THERE'S PLENTY OUT THERE INCLUDING ACTUAL SOULS GAMES. IF YOU NEED A GAME WITH PSYCHIC POWERS, CONTROL IS A LOT OF FUN.
YOU1000000159_S0000067	AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS AND DO ALMOST LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOUR TIME.
YOU1000000159_S0000069	YEAH, WE'RE GONNA TRY OUR BEST TO FORGET ABOUT THOSE. FOR MORE GOOD GAMES, THOUGH, BE SURE TO CHECK OUT ALL OUR PICKS FOR THE BEST GAMES OF 2020, OR, IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AHEAD, HAVE A LOOK AT ALL THE BIG GAMES SLATED FOR RELEASE IN 2021.
YOU1000000159_S0000070	FOR MORE ON GAMING'S GOOD, BAD, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN, YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE RIGHT PLACE HERE AT IGN.
YOU1000000160_S0000000	THE CONSOLE WARS ARE ENTERING A WHOLE NEW ERA IN 2020 AS WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF GAMING AND A MASSIVE TECH GIANT ENTERS THE PICTURE.
YOU1000000160_S0000001	BUT AS A GAMER, WHAT NEW CONSOLE DO YOU CHOOSE? OR DO YOU PICK THEM ALL?
YOU1000000160_S0000002	WELL, WE MADE THE CHOICE EVEN EASIER FOR YOU TODAY, AS WE PIT THE PS5 UP AGAINST THE XBOX 2 AND THE GOOGLE STADIA IN THE ULTIMATE BATTLE OF CONSOLE DOMINATION.
YOU1000000160_S0000003	THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT BRAND LOYALTY AS WE BREAK DOWN GAMING CHOICES, FEATURES, GRAPHICS, AND ONLINE INTERACTION TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE WINNER.
YOU1000000160_S0000005	GRAPHICS COMPARISONS 4K GRAPHICS ARE THE NEW STANDARD IN GAMING, AND THIS IS THE BARE MINIMUM THAT WILL BE SUPPLIED BY ALL THREE CONSOLES.
YOU1000000160_S0000006	THE ONE CAVEAT? INTERNET SPEED. PLAYING A DETAIL RICH GAME LIKE ASSASSIN'S CREED ORIGINS COULD LOOK VERY DIFFERENT AT ONE HOME USING STADIA COMPARED TO ANOTHER.
YOU1000000160_S0000007	THE GOOGLE STADIA USES VARIABLE GRAPHIC PERFORMANCE BASED SOLELY ON INTERNET SPEED.
YOU1000000160_S0000008	SO IF YOUR PARENTS ARE BINGE WATCHING NETFLIX WHILE YOUR LITTLE SISTER JAMS OUT TO SPOTIFY, YOU COULD EASILY FIND YOURSELF PLAYING A GAME AT 720P WITH STEREO SOUND INSTEAD OF BEING MAXED OUT AT 4K GRAPHICS WITH HDR VIDEO AND 5.1 SURROUND SOUND.
YOU1000000160_S0000009	THE PS5 AND XBOX TWO WILL RELY ON DISCS AND DOWNLOADS TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT QUALITY FOR A LOT OF THE GAMES.
YOU1000000160_S0000010	BESIDES THE 4K QUALITY, EACH OF THE THREE CONSOLES ALSO AIM TO PROVIDE 60 FRAMES PER SECOND AS A STANDARD FOR A MAJORITY OF THE GAME.
YOU1000000160_S0000011	IN SIMPLE TERMS, CHARACTER MOVEMENTS ARE GOING TO LOOK INCREDIBLY SMOOTH, THINGS LIKE CAR RACES ARE GOING TO BE FLUID, AND ALL THOSE FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS WILL BE EVEN BETTER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE.
YOU1000000160_S0000012	ANOTHER WAY THESE CONSOLES ARE ALL IMPROVING ON THE GRAPHICAL PRESENTATION? WITH RAY TRACING.
YOU1000000160_S0000013	THE LIGHTING TECHNIQUE INCLUDES EXTREMELY VIVID GRAPHICS, AND WILL MAKE EVERYTHING FROM REFLECTIONS TO SHADOWS LOOK EVEN MORE REALISTIC THAN THEY ALREADY ARE.
YOU1000000160_S0000014	ALL IN ALL, EACH CONSOLE IS PRETTY MUCH ON PAR WITH EACH OTHER IN THE GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT, WITH THE PS5 AND XBOX 2 TAKING A SLIGHT EDGE BECAUSE OF STADIA'S RELIANCE ON PROPER INTERNET SPEEDS.
YOU1000000160_S0000015	THE CONTROLLERS WHAT ARE GOOD GRAPHICS WITHOUT A GOOD CONTROLLER TO ENJOY THOSE GAMES WITH? THE PS5 AND XBOX TWO BOTH HAVE A HISTORY OF CONTROLLERS THEIR GAMERS ARE USED TO.
YOU1000000160_S0000016	WHILE YOU CAN EXPECT MORE OF THE SAME FROM XBOX WITH THEIR PRO CONTROLLER, SONY IS MAKING VAST IMPROVEMENTS FOR THEIR NEXT ENTRY IN THE DUALSHOCK CONTROLLER.
YOU1000000160_S0000017	ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEATURES IS A MAJOR UPGRADE IN THE RUMBLE TECHNOLOGY AND THE ADAPTIVE NATURE OF THE ANALOG STACKS.
YOU1000000160_S0000018	NO LONGER WILL THE CONTROLLER JUST PLAY OUT A RANDOM RUMBLE OR BUZZ WHILE YOU PLAY.
YOU1000000160_S0000019	EVERYTHING REACTS TO THE SURROUNDINGS YOU'RE IN. IF YOU'RE AN UNDERCOVER AGENT WHO MUST CLIMB THEIR WAY THROUGH A SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE, YOU'LL FEEL THE STRUGGLE OF EACH FOOTSTEP AS YOU MOVE THE ANALOG STICK AROUND.
YOU1000000160_S0000020	DRIVING A VEHICLE ON A BEACH INSTEAD OF THE ROAD? YOU'LL FEEL THE DIFFERENCE AS YOU TRAVEL THROUGH SAND AS OPPOSED TO THE PAVED ROAD.
YOU1000000160_S0000021	ON TOP OF THAT, THE TRIGGER BUTTONS ON TOP OF THE NEWEST DUALSHOCK CONTROLLER ARE MORE SENSITIVE THAN EVER.
YOU1000000160_S0000022	BLASTING YOUR WAY THROUGH LEVELS WITH A LASER GUN WILL FEEL VERY DIFFERENT THAN PLAYING AS BATMAN AND THROWING A BATARANG, AND THE PRESSURE YOU PLACE ON THE TRIGGER WILL INDICATE THE SPEED AND FORCE RATHER THAN JUST BUTTON MASHING.
YOU1000000160_S0000023	GOOGLE STADIA ISN'T TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL WITH THEIR CONTROLLER EITHER. KNOWING WHAT WORKS, THE STADIA CONTROLLER FEATURES DUAL ANALOG STICKS, THE TYPICAL INPUT BUTTONS, AND MULTIPLE TRIGGERS ON TOP.
YOU1000000160_S0000024	IF THE DUALSHOCK CONTROLLER WORKS WITHOUT ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS OR GLITCHES, THEN THE PS5 EDGES OUT THE COMPETITION FOR THE INNOVATIVE NATURE OF THEIR DESIGN.
YOU1000000160_S0000025	CLOUD GAME SERVICES AND SPEAKING OF CLOUD BASED GAMING, GOOGLE STADIA IS NOT THE ONLY ONE PROVIDING THIS STREAMING SERVICE.
YOU1000000160_S0000026	BESIDES THEIR TYPICAL GAME RELEASES AND DIGITAL DOWNLOADS, BOTH SONY AND MICROSOFT HAVE THEIR OWN SUBSCRIPTION BASED STREAMING GAME SERVICES.
YOU1000000160_S0000027	THE XBOX GAME PASS IS PRICED AT $10 A MONTH AND FEATURES OVER 100 GAMES WITH A ROTATING TITLE OF OPTIONS INCLUDING CONSOLE CLASSICS.
YOU1000000160_S0000028	THE XCLOUD SERVICE MICROSOFT RUNS ON LOOKS TO EXPAND THE GAME PASS TO ALL TYPES OF IOS AND ANDROID DEVICES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
YOU1000000160_S0000029	THE PLAYSTATION NOW SERVICE HAS AN AFFORDABLE OPTION IF PLAYERS ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR A WHOLE YEAR UP FRONT.
YOU1000000160_S0000030	WHILE THE BASE PRICE STARTS AT $9.99 PER MONTH, A WHOLE YEAR COSTS AROUND $60, WHICH EQUALS OUT TO $5 A MONTH.
YOU1000000160_S0000031	THE PS5 WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ENJOY THE SERVICE, WITH A HUGE LIBRARY OF PAST GAMES FROM THE PS2, PS3, AND PS4 ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.
YOU1000000160_S0000032	THE CLOUD BASED SERVICE ALSO INCLUDES PC GAMING THROUGH THE PS NOW APP. THE PRICING DISCOUNTS GIVE THE PLAYSTATION CLOUD STREAMING A HUGE PLUS.
YOU1000000160_S0000033	BUT THE XBOX GAME PASS DOES HAVE SOME EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO MINECRAFT, SO THERE'S THAT. IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO COMPARE STADIA'S OPTIONS UNTIL THE SERVICE FULLY ROLLS OUT, BUT THERE WILL BE A FREE PLAN.
YOU1000000160_S0000034	ALLOWING GAMERS TO HOP ON ANY GOOGLE DEVICE AND PLAY. THE PRO PLAN WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF FREE MONTHLY GAMING OPTIONS AS WELL. SOLID STATE HARD DRIVES.
YOU1000000160_S0000035	THE INSIDES OF BOTH THE XBOX 2 AND PS5 WILL SHOW A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT WITH SOLID STATE HARD DRIVES.
YOU1000000160_S0000036	THE MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT WAS YEARS IN THE MAKING, AND THE MORE AFFORDABLE HARD DRIVES WILL BE A GAME CHANGER IN MANY WAYS.
YOU1000000160_S0000037	LOAD TIMES WILL BE VIRTUALLY NON EXISTENT, AND THE STRUGGLES OF SAVING HARD DRIVE SPACE WILL BE GONE AS WELL. WITH A SOLID STATE DRIVE, GAMERS DON'T NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE GAME TO PLAY.
YOU1000000160_S0000038	NOT INTERESTED IN THE SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN? JUST DOWNLOAD THE MULTIPLAYER ELEMENT OF THE GAME AND BE ON YOUR MERRY WAY!
YOU1000000160_S0000039	NOT ONLY WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SAVE HARD DRIVE SPACE, BUT THE ANTICIPATION OF PLAYING A GAME WILL NOT TAKE HOURS AND HOURS.
YOU1000000160_S0000040	ON THE GOOGLE SIDE OF THINGS, EVEN THOUGH THE STADIA PLATFORM WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CHROMECAST ULTRA AND CHROMEBOOKS, THERE ARE NO DOWNLOADS NEEDED. EVERYTHING WILL BE CLOUD BASED.
YOU1000000160_S0000041	SAVING SOME HARD DRIVE SPACE AND REDUCING LOADING TIMES AS GOOGLE'S HIGH SPEED SERVERS PROVIDE ALL THE LOADING AND SPACE YOU NEED FOR A WHOLE LIBRARY OF GAMES.
YOU1000000160_S0000043	GAME STREAMS IN TODAY'S GAMING WORLD, DOES IT EVEN COUNT THAT YOU'VE PLAYED A GAME IF YOUR EPIC SKILLS OR EPIC FAILS WERE NOT CAPTURED IN SOME SORT OF GAME STREAM?
YOU1000000160_S0000044	WELL, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE CASE, AND LIVE GAME STREAM FOCUS HAS BEEN AN EMPHASIS FOR ALL THE NEXT GEN CONSOLES.
YOU1000000160_S0000045	MICROSOFT IS GETTING PRETTY SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR ONLINE STREAMING PLATFORM MIXER.
YOU1000000160_S0000046	THE NEWEST COMPETITOR TO TWITCH WILL BE INTEGRATED DIRECTLY INTO THE XBOX TOO, MAKING IT EASY FOR PLAYERS TO HOP ONLINE AND BROADCAST THEIR LIVE STREAMS.
YOU1000000160_S0000047	A PICTURE IN PICTURE FORMAT ALSO ALLOWS PLAYERS TO WATCH MIXER STREAMS WHILE THEY PLAY THEIR OWN GAMES. PLUS, NINJA HAS JOINED THE MIXER PARTY, GIVING THE WHOLE SERVICE A LOT OF LEGITIMACY AND FANFARE.
YOU1000000160_S0000048	I WILL BE STREAMING EXCLUSIVELY ON MIXER.
YOU1000000160_S0000049	SONY DOES NOT HAVE THEIR OWN STREAMING SERVICE, BUT TWITCH IS READILY AVAILABLE FOR THE CONSOLE, AND WILL LIKELY MAKE THE SAME TRANSITION WITH THE PS5.
YOU1000000160_S0000050	MEANWHILE, THE POWERHOUSE OF GOOGLE HAS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR VIDEO STREAMING WEBSITES AT ITS FINGERTIPS IN THE FORM OF YOUTUBE.
YOU1000000160_S0000051	WITH A CAPTURE BUTTON FEATURED ON THE STADIA CONTROLLER, PLAYERS WILL EASILY BE ABLE TO SORT OUT CONTENT,
YOU1000000160_S0000052	UPLOAD FOOTAGE, AND CREATE ALL TYPES OF STADIA YOUTUBE CONTENT. THE YOUTUBE INTEGRATION IS HUGE FOR STADIA, BUT THE XBOX MIXER SERVICE MAY EDGE THEM ALL OUT.
YOU1000000160_S0000053	NINJA HAS GARNERED A TON OF PRESS FOR HIS SWITCH, AND BY THE TIME THE XBOX 2 GETS RELEASED, THE PLATFORM COULD HAVE AN EVEN LARGER VIEWING AUDIENCE.
YOU1000000160_S0000054	ONLINE PLAY WITH CLOUD BASED GAMES, HUGE DOWNLOADS, AND AN EMPHASIS ON SERVICES LIKE XBOX LIVE AND PLAYSTATION PLUS, ONLINE GAMING WILL BE BIGGER THAN EVER IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF CONSOLES.

YOU1000000160_S0000057	AND THAT PLAYER CAN REAP ALL THE BENEFITS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT HELPS THE STADIA STAND OUT ABOVE THE REST? THE CROWD PLAY FEATURE.
YOU1000000160_S0000058	ENJOYING YOUR FAVORITE STREAMER IN A POPULAR MULTIPLAYER GAME? WELL, THE CROWDPLAY FEATURE ALLOWS YOU TO HOP IN ON THEIR ACTUAL GAME, GIVING GAMERS A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH SOME OF THEIR FAVORITES.

YOU1000000160_S0000064	SO FAR, THE ONLY FREE GAME PACKAGED WITH THE STADIA PREMIERE EDITION IS DESTINY 2 THE COLLECTION.
YOU1000000160_S0000065	MEANWHILE, YOU CAN EXPECT BOTH PLAYSTATION PLUS AND XBOX GOLD TO CONTINUE ROLLING OUT THEIR FREE GAME OPTIONS.
YOU1000000160_S0000066	THE FREE GAMES HAVE BEEN A HUGE HIGHLIGHT, PAYING THE MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTIONS ON BOTH SYSTEMS, AND REMOVING THE FEATURE WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A LOT LESS SUBSCRIBERS.
YOU1000000160_S0000067	THE FREE GAME FEATURE IS AN IDEAL WAY FOR THIRD PARTY AND INDEPENDENT PUBLISHERS TO SHOWCASE A VARIETY OF THEIR GAMES AND GIVES PLAYERS AN EASY WAY TO BUILD UP THEIR LIBRARY.
YOU1000000160_S0000068	GOOGLE DEFINITELY HAS A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO IN THE FREE GAME DEPARTMENT, BUT THE COMPANY IS ALSO WORKING ON PUBLISHING THEIR OWN GAMES.
YOU1000000160_S0000069	SO THERE COULD BE SOME MAJOR CHANGES AND MORE ACCESS TO GAMES DOWN THE LINE.
YOU1000000160_S0000070	BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY GOOGLE IS THE LITTLE BABY AMONG THE BUNCH. UNLESS THEY DECIDE TO CONNECT TO SERVICES LIKE EPIC GAMES OR STEAM, DO NOT EXPECT A HUGE BACK LIBRARY OF GAME DOWNLOADS AND BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY.
YOU1000000160_S0000071	MEANWHILE, MICROSOFT AND SONY WILL CONTINUE TO HONOR THEIR FAITHFUL, MAKING YOU WANT TO DUST OFF SOME DISCS IN THE LONG RUN.
YOU1000000160_S0000072	SONY WILL ALLOW ANY PS4 DISC TO WORK ON THE CONSOLE, GIVING PLAYERS A LOT OF TIME TO STACK UP ON GAMES OVER THE NEXT YEAR.
YOU1000000160_S0000073	MEANWHILE, THE XBOX 2 MIGHT AS WELL BE CALLED THE XBOX LEGACY, BECAUSE THE CONSOLE REALLY BLOWS ALL THE OTHERS OUT OF THE PARK WITH ITS PHYSICAL DISC COMPATIBILITY.
YOU1000000160_S0000074	THE CONSOLE WILL BE ABLE TO READ EVERY SINGLE XBOX GAME FROM THE ORIGINAL CONSOLE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE XBOX ONE.
YOU1000000160_S0000075	THIS IS A HUGE FEATURE AND WILL LIKELY HAVE US ON EBAY SNATCHING UP OLD GAMES WE USED TO LOVE.
YOU1000000160_S0000076	NEEDLESS TO SAY, BUT THE XBOX 2 HAS THE MAJOR ADVANTAGE IN THIS CATEGORY. OTHER FORMS OF MEDIA.
YOU1000000160_S0000077	WHILE WE ALL LOVE OUR HOURS AND HOURS OF GAMING MARATHONS, CONSOLES HAVE BECOME A LOT MORE THAN JUST GAMING MACHINES. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE EXTRAS.
YOU1000000160_S0000078	ANYONE WHO PURCHASES THE STADIA PREMIERE EDITION WILL GET A CHROMECAST ULTRA, THE HDMI DEVICE WHICH OFFERS STREAMING ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT CHANNELS ALONG WITH SOME LIVE TV OPTIONS LIKE SLING.
YOU1000000160_S0000079	NATURALLY, BOTH THE XBOX AND PLAYSTATION WILL CONTINUE THEIR WIDE RANGE OF STREAMING CHANNELS LIKE NETFLIX, HULU, AND NEWER OPTIONS LIKE DISNEY+.
YOU1000000160_S0000080	ON THE XBOX SIDE OF THINGS, THE EXCLUSIVE NFL CONTENT WILL HELP DRAW IN SPORTS FANS. MEANWHILE, SONY CONTINUES TO PROMOTE THEIR LIVE TV SERVICE, PLAYSTATION VIEW.
YOU1000000160_S0000081	THE VIEW IS AVAILABLE ON MULTIPLE DEVICES, MAKING IT AN OPTION FOR WHEN THE PS5 IS NOT IN USE.
YOU1000000160_S0000082	EXPECT THE EXPANSION OF THE VIEW SERVICE ON THE PS5 WITH SOME POSSIBLE ADDED FEATURES AND EXTRA CONTENT.
YOU1000000160_S0000083	NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF VIDEO STREAMS YOU ENJOY, ALL THE CONSOLES ARE PRETTY MUCH EQUAL IN THIS CATEGORY. RELEASE DATES!
YOU1000000160_S0000084	OKAY, NOW THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE NEWEST CONSOLES, IT'S PRETTY MUCH A RACE TO THE FINISH LINE TO SEE WHICH ONES WILL GET RELEASED FIRST.
YOU1000000160_S0000085	WELL, GOOGLE HAS A HEAD START AS THE PREMIERE EDITION OF STADIA WILL ROLL OUT IN NOVEMBER, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SOME MAJOR DELAYS DUE TO THE PRE ORDERS SELLING OUT ACROSS THE GLOBE.
YOU1000000160_S0000086	THAT STADIA IS LAUNCHING THIS YEAR, 2019.
YOU1000000160_S0000088	NO MATTER WHEN THE VARIOUS FORMS GOOGLE STADIA PRE ORDERS DO ARRIVE, IT WILL BE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE PS5 AND XBOX TWO.
YOU1000000160_S0000089	THE SONY AND MICROSOFT CONSOLES ARE SET FOR A HOLIDAY 2020 LAUNCH DATE, GIVING GOOGLE PLENTY OF TIME TO WORK OUT THE KINKS, BUILD UP ON THE HYPE, AND ALLOW STADIA TO BECOME A HOUSEHOLD NAME.
YOU1000000160_S0000090	THE LATEST RUMOR POINTS TO THE SONY PS5 GETTING RELEASED ON DECEMBER 4TH, 2020. JUST IN TIME TO PLACE A BIG OL' BOX UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE.
YOU1000000160_S0000091	LET'S JUST SAY THAT CHRISTMAS BREAK 2020 WILL BE FILLED WITH A WHOLE LOT OF GAMES. WOW, WHAT A BATTLE BETWEEN SOME JUGGERNAUTS.
YOU1000000160_S0000092	THE CLOUD SERVICE STREAMING DEFINITELY LIMITS STADIA'S PRESENCE IN THE CONSOLE WARS, BUT THE ABILITY TO PLAY ON A PIXEL 4 ALSO CHANGES GAMING FOREVER.
YOU1000000160_S0000093	MICROSOFT AND SONY ARE SURE MAKING SOME MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS, BUT TIME WILL ONLY TELL WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY GET SOME HANDS ON ACTION WITH THE CONSOLES.
YOU1000000160_S0000094	EITHER WAY, WE'RE ALL EXCITED FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF GAMING.
YOU1000000160_S0000095	AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN. WHICH CONSOLE HAS IMPRESSED YOU THE MOST SO FAR? WHAT FEATURES ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO? ANYTHING GREAT WE MISSED?
YOU1000000160_S0000096	WELL, LET US KNOW IN THE COMMENTS AND STICK AROUND THE GAMER FOR MORE GREAT VIDEO GAME CONTENT.

YOU1000000161_S0000001	I DECIDED I WANTED TO MAKE A SNEAKER VIDEO. I NEVER MADE A REAL SNEAKER VIDEO, BUT IF I WAS GONNA DO IT, I HAD TO DO IT BIG.
YOU1000000161_S0000002	24 HOURS AGO, I DID NOT OWN A SINGLE JORDAN. AS YOU CAN TELL, THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
YOU1000000161_S0000003	I DECIDED TO EMBARK ON AN EXPEDITION FOR AN UNBOXING VIDEO OF EVERY JORDAN EVER.
YOU1000000161_S0000004	QUICK DISCLAIMER, I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON GAME WORN JORDANS. OF COURSE, WE KNOW THERE ARE 31 PAIRS OF JORDANS.
YOU1000000161_S0000005	BUT ONLY 18 DURING HIS PLAYING CAREER. EACH ONE REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT STAGE, A DIFFERENT TIME. NOT JUST IN MICHAEL JORDAN'S CAREER, BUT YOUR LIFE!
YOU1000000161_S0000006	BUT HERE'S THE THING, I CAN'T DO A VIDEO OF THIS MAGNITUDE WITHOUT CALLING IN A SPECIAL FAVOR.
YOU1000000161_S0000007	WITHOUT CALLING UP THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

YOU1000000161_S0000069	TO ALL THE NON SNEAKERHEADS, THESE ARE THE LACES. I DON'T LIKE SEEING THE MICHAEL AIR JORDAN DUNKING ON THE BACK.

YOU1000000161_S0000071	MHM.
YOU1000000161_S0000072	ARE THOSE AVAILABLE FOR USE OR ARE THOSE JUST FOR LOOKS?

YOU1000000161_S0000129	HMM. LOOK AT THAT. I PREFER LOOKING AT THE MONITOR THAN SEEING THEM IN REAL LIFE ACTUALLY. LOOK AT THAT.
YOU1000000161_S0000130	I FEEL LIKE THEY'VE KIND OF TAMED A LITTLE BIT FROM THE LAST ONE WITH THE UNUSUAL COLOR HERE, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU1000000161_S0000131	OLYMPICS
YOU1000000161_S0000132	THE OLYMPICS. MICHAEL WINS HIS THIRD MVP AWARD, HIS SIXTH NBA SCORING TITLE, THE FINALS MVP AWARD, HIS SECOND NBA CHAMPIONSHIP, AND HIS SECOND OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL.

YOU1000000161_S0000163	YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE 10 WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THIS SOUL. TALK ABOUT HISTORY, YOU'RE WEARING IT ON YOUR FEET.

YOU1000000161_S0000165	WE ARE NOW BACK IN THE REALM OF THAT NUMBER FOUR.

YOU1000000161_S0000167	YEAH.
YOU1000000161_S0000168	LITTLE BLUE TEASING YOU ON THE RIM AND YOU JUST WANT TO GET IN THERE AND SEE WHAT'S DOWN THERE.

YOU1000000161_S0000171	NO.
YOU1000000161_S0000172	I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT BECAUSE THEY'RE NUMBERED AND WE JUST HIT 10.
YOU1000000161_S0000174	THIS IS A DIFFERENT UNBOXING EXPERIENCE. LOOK AT THIS, YOU CAN START TO TELL RIGHT AWAY, YOU GET THE LITTLE CLAWS GOING ON. THESE ARE NUMBER 11, BUT THEY'RE NOT JUST ANY 11.

YOU1000000161_S0000189	SEE, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TELLING A STORY, YOU TALK ABOUT A SHOE THAT'S GOT A SOMETHING ATTACHED TO IT. WE SAID HISTORY EARLIER.
YOU1000000161_S0000190	OF COURSE THIS ONE, THE YEAR JORDAN WENT OFF TO MAKE SPACE JAM, THE WHOLE BASEBALL THING, THE NUMBER 45 TEMPORARILY.
YOU1000000161_S0000191	WHEN YOU SEE THIS SNEAKER, THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT COMES TO MIND.
YOU1000000161_S0000193	NO.
YOU1000000161_S0000195	I DIDN'T NECESSARILY THINK I WOULD HAVE THIS TYPE OF EMOTIONAL REACTION TO THIS PARTICULAR SHOE, BUT IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000161_S0000197	A MAGIC TRICK.
YOU1000000161_S0000199	I HAD THESE SHOES AS A KID. MAN, THAT'S SOMETHING.

YOU1000000161_S0000201	WOW.
YOU1000000161_S0000203	THAT'S A DISTINCTIVE LOOK WITHOUT BEING OVERWHELMING.
YOU1000000161_S0000204	THIS COMES TOGETHER NICELY.
YOU1000000161_S0000205	YOU NOTICE DETAILS, BUT FROM A DISTANCE, IT'S A PACKAGE. YOU SEE THE COMPLEXITY.
YOU1000000161_S0000207	GREAT CONTRAST, JUST LIKE THERE.
YOU1000000161_S0000209	LOW TOPS
YOU1000000161_S0000210	HMM.
YOU1000000161_S0000211	NOT MY FAVORITE.
YOU1000000161_S0000212	HMM. LOOKING AT IT ON ITS OWN, YOU CAN SEE THE INSIDE OF THE SHOE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU1000000161_S0000213	THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOUR FOOT WERE IN IT.
YOU1000000161_S0000214	THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT WORKS
YOU1000000161_S0000216	ROLLS OVER EASY THIS WAY, BUT THIS WAY?
YOU1000000161_S0000218	CAN'T ROLL OVER.
YOU1000000161_S0000219	I THINK OF THE JORDANS AS TIED TO HIS CAREER. WE STILL HAVE ONE HIGHLIGHT LEFT.
YOU1000000161_S0000221	SAME MODEL HE WORE FOR HIS LAST SHOT, JUST A DIFFERENT COLORWAY. I LOVE RELIVING THAT, SEEING HIM SYNC THAT SHOT. UNUSUAL TONGUE.
YOU1000000161_S0000222	MAYBE THE WEIRDEST TONGUE WE'VE SEEN. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS FUTURISTIC AT THE TIME.
YOU1000000161_S0000223	A JETSON OF SHOES.
YOU1000000161_S0000224	THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU1000000161_S0000225	LIKE I AM ROBOT.
YOU1000000161_S0000226	HMM. THEY'RE NOT MY FAVORITE. YEAH
YOU1000000161_S0000227	I DO LIKE THIS PAIR.
YOU1000000161_S0000229	WHAT HAPPENED? IT'S LIKE I JUST SAID, IT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU1000000161_S0000231	THIS ONE, I THINK IT'S NOW COMING INTO ITS OWN.
YOU1000000161_S0000232	FOR REAL 16 THIS THING IS REMOVABLE, RIGHT?
YOU1000000161_S0000234	THIS IS NOT THAT BAD. THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING WITH THE... THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.
YOU1000000161_S0000236	I LIKE THESE WITHOUT THE SHROUDS
YOU1000000161_S0000237	YEAH.
YOU1000000161_S0000238	I WORRIED THAT I'D TRIP OVER THIS OR LOSE IT.
YOU1000000161_S0000239	17
YOU1000000161_S0000241	HMM. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT THESE. THIS TO ME FEELS MORE LIKE A NIKE SHOE THAN A JORDAN.
YOU1000000161_S0000242	THIS ONE FEELS LIKE SOME KIND OF A DRESS SHOOT TO ME.
YOU1000000161_S0000243	THIS STUFF ON THE BACK, YEAH.
YOU1000000161_S0000244	HE LIKES GOING FROM THE COURT TO THE BOARDROOM.
YOU1000000161_S0000245	WELL SAID.
YOU1000000161_S0000246	THANK YOU.
YOU1000000161_S0000247	I DON'T LIKE THIS SHOE ACTUALLY. THIS WAS THE HARDEST ONE TO FIND BY THE WAY. THIS CAME FROM SOMEBODY'S PERSONAL COLLECTION.
YOU1000000161_S0000249	HARDEST TO GET OPEN TOO.
YOU1000000161_S0000250	NO, THAT'S IT. THAT'S AS FAR AS IT GOES.
YOU1000000161_S0000251	NO.
YOU1000000161_S0000252	YEAH.
YOU1000000161_S0000253	I CAN GET IT OUT FURTHER.
YOU1000000161_S0000255	I'LL DO IT LATER.
YOU1000000161_S0000256	I DON'T EVEN. THIS IS I DON'T EVEN. IT'S UNFORTUNATE.
YOU1000000161_S0000257	MM.
YOU1000000161_S0000258	THIS IS THE END THOUGH.
YOU1000000161_S0000259	MAYBE WE WISH HE RETIRED EARLIER, TO BE HONEST.
YOU1000000161_S0000260	THIS IS THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW WHERE WE EACH SELECT OUR FAVORITE OUT OF THE BUNCH. I MEAN WE JUST UNBOXED 18 DIFFERENT JORDANS HERE.
YOU1000000161_S0000261	WHO BETTER THAN US TO TELL YOU WHICH IS THE BEST? YOU GO FIRST.
YOU1000000161_S0000262	OKAY, MICHAEL OR JORDAN ONE. IT'S THE BEGINNING. I JUST LOVE THIS SHOE IN AN ADULT SIZE
YOU1000000161_S0000263	IT'S A GREAT SHOE, IT'S A CLASSIC LOOK. I SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THE LESS DESIRABLE SHOES HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST TO FIND.
YOU1000000161_S0000264	THE COLLECTING PART OF IT IS ONLY HALF THE THING, LIKE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO WEAR THIS HISTORY.
YOU1000000161_S0000265	FOR ME, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PACKAGE RIGHT HERE WHICH JUST SCREAMS OF A VERY PARTICULAR ERA.
YOU1000000161_S0000266	THIS GIVES ME POSITIVE VIBES. THERE'S A CONFIDENCE HERE. THIS IS ICONIC TO ME.
YOU1000000161_S0000267	THEY ALL ARE IN A WAY.
YOU1000000161_S0000268	THEY ALL ARE IN THE WORLD. THAT'S UP THERE TOO. OUT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT TIME PERIOD, THIS EMERGED.
YOU1000000161_S0000269	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
YOU1000000161_S0000271	SO THERE YOU HAVE IT, EVERY GAME WARDEN JORDAN UNBOXED HERE. THANKS TO MY FRIEND, BRAD HALL.
YOU1000000161_S0000272	THANK YOU. THIS WAS FUN.
YOU1000000162_S0000000	SO I MADE A VIDEO RECENTLY ABOUT THE APPLE AIRPODS. THEY CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE. I'VE BEEN USING THE AIRPODS AND KIND OF ENJOYING IT.
YOU1000000162_S0000002	THEY'RE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL, YOU SEE THEM OUT IN THE WORLD, OTHER MANUFACTURERS, THEY'RE ENTERING THE SPACE.
YOU1000000162_S0000003	THIS IS THE LATEST INCARNATION OF THE FULLY WIRELESS SAMSUNG EARBUD PRODUCT.
YOU1000000162_S0000004	IT HAS A COUPLE OF FEATURES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN SEEN BEFORE. PROBABLY MY FAVORITE ONE IS THE FACT THAT THIS ENTIRE SETUP
YOU1000000162_S0000005	CAN CHARGE FROM ANY PHONE THAT SUPPORTS WIRELESS CHARGE SHARING. BECAUSE THIS IS A SAMSUNG PRODUCT AND THIS IS A SAMSUNG PHONE,
YOU1000000162_S0000006	THERE'S ALSO SOME INTERPLAY THERE THAT'S A BIT SMOOTHER THAN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE WITH A THIRD PARTY PAIR OF EARPODS. EARPODS.
YOU1000000162_S0000007	BUT ONCE YOU'RE INTO THE APP, THIS IS WHERE I THINK THEY HAVE A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE AIRPODS. THEY'RE SUPER CONFIGURABLE.
YOU1000000162_S0000008	HERE WE CAN SEE THE BATTERY LIFE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT. YOU CAN USE ONE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE OTHER.
YOU1000000162_S0000009	YOU CAN KEEP ONE OF THESE GUYS CHARGING IN THE CASE WHILE LISTENING TO THE OTHER ONE.
YOU1000000162_S0000010	THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT EQUALIZER SETTINGS HERE FOR A BASS BOOST, SOFT, DYNAMIC, CLEAR, AND SO ON.
YOU1000000162_S0000011	YOU CAN MANAGE HOW THESE THINGS DEAL WITH NOTIFICATIONS, THEY DO HAVE TOUCHPADS ON THE SIDE, UNLIKE THE AIRPODS.
YOU1000000162_S0000012	THESE HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE EAR TIPS AND EAR HOOKS AS WELL. LOOK AT ALL THOSE OPTIONS.
YOU1000000162_S0000013	THE AIRPOD, YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE, DOESN'T FIT THAT FAR INTO THE EAR CANAL. FOR SOME PEOPLE, THIS FITS REALLY WELL. OTHERS, IT WON'T STAY IN THEIR EARS.
YOU1000000162_S0000014	THESE ON THE OTHER HAND ARE GOING TO BE A BIT MORE PREDICTABLE BECAUSE THEY SIT FURTHER IN THE EAR CANAL AND THEY HAVE THAT SECONDARY RUBBER PLASTICKY COMPONENT.
YOU1000000162_S0000015	THEY SHOULD JUST BE A BIT MORE SECURE IN THERE CONSIDERING THE WAY THAT THEY'RE DESIGNED.
YOU1000000162_S0000016	THE AIRPOD IS A BIT TALLER, BUT ALSO SLIGHTLY LESS CHUNKY THAN THE GALAXY BUD.
YOU1000000162_S0000017	SO PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW, HEY, WHICH ONE SHOULD I GET? CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN USE EITHER ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS.
YOU1000000162_S0000018	IF YOU WORK AS BLUETOOTH HEADSETS, YOU COULD USE THE AIRPODS ON ANDROID. YOU COULD USE THE GALAXY BUDS ON IOS.
YOU1000000162_S0000019	WITHIN THE APP THERE'S ALSO A FIND MY EARBUDS BUTTON SO THAT'LL TRACK THESE DOWN. THESE THINGS COULD BE PRETTY EASY TO LOSE, I MEAN THEY ARE TINY.
YOU1000000162_S0000020	ALSO, THERE'S A PRETTY COOL AMBIENT SOUND OPTION. I CAN ACTUALLY ELEVATE THE VOLUME OF THE AMBIENT SOUND, THE SOUND AROUND ME.
YOU1000000162_S0000021	SO IT'LL BE AMPLIFIED INTO MY EARS SO I CAN HEAR MY SURROUNDINGS WHILE I'M LISTENING TO MUSIC, PODCAST, AUDIOBOOK, AND SO ON.
YOU1000000162_S0000022	NOW YOU CAN TOGGLE THAT ALL THE WAY DOWN SO THAT IT'S MUTED AND WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND ME IS MUTED
YOU1000000162_S0000023	YOU CAN HAVE AMBIENT IF YOU'RE ON THE BIKE, YOU'RE CYCLING, YOU NEED TO HEAR IF A CAR HONKS ITS HORN OR SOMETHING. THIS CAN REALLY AMPLIFY YOUR SURROUNDINGS.
YOU1000000162_S0000024	OF COURSE IT'S NOT ON THE AIRPODS. THERE'S ALSO A VOICE FOCUS FEATURE IN THERE. SO THIS LOOKS FOR VOICES SPECIFICALLY.
YOU1000000162_S0000025	AND ALLOWS THEM TO CUT THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR FREQUENCY RANGE. I FIND THIS TO BE USEFUL FROM TIME TO TIME.
YOU1000000162_S0000026	NOW THE WAY THAT THE TOUCHPAD WORKS, YOU CAN TAP TO PLAY OR PAUSE A TRACK, DOUBLE TAP TO PLAY THE NEXT TRACK, ANSWER OR END A PHONE CALL,
YOU1000000162_S0000027	TRIPLE TAP TO PLAY THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND TOUCH AND HOLD TO USE A USER CONFIGURABLE USER'S CHOICE
YOU1000000162_S0000028	YOU COULD HAVE THAT LAUNCH SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY, DO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY, AND THAT'S USER CONFIGURABLE. THAT'S NICE.
YOU1000000162_S0000029	NOW THAT I HAVE IT FOR QUICK AMBIENT SOUND, I'M GONNA TOUCH AND HOLD AND SEE IF I CAN LIGHTEN UP THE SURROUNDINGS. HERE WE GO.
YOU1000000162_S0000031	WOW, THAT'S COOL. IT TOGGLES AMBIENT MODE WHILE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR FINGER ON THE TOUCHPAD. I'M IN AMBIENT RIGHT NOW. I CAN TOTALLY HEAR MY CONVERSATION, HEAR MY OWN VOICE. NOW, DO I LOOK A LITTLE STRANGE DOING THIS? QUITE POSSIBLY.
YOU1000000162_S0000032	BUT THE QUESTION YOU ALL HAVE IS LIKE HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST THE AIRPODS? NOW AS YOU GUYS KNOW, I'M AN S10 USER. THIS IS THE DEVICE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN MY POCKET.
YOU1000000162_S0000033	SO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EITHER OF THESE EARBUDS, IT HAS TO BE IN CORRELATION TO THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE.
YOU1000000162_S0000034	WE TALKED ABOUT SOME ADVANTAGES WITHIN THE APP. WHO KNOWS, I MIGHT BE WILLING TO GIVE UP THOSE EXTRA FEATURES IN EXCHANGE FOR POTENTIALLY BETTER SOUND. I'M NOT REALLY SURE.
YOU1000000162_S0000035	WE'LL START WITH THE GALAXY BUDS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT MAXIMUM VOLUME. OKAY, SO NOW I KNOW I'VE GOT MAX VOLUME. A LITTLE SAMPLE.
YOU1000000162_S0000036	MMM.
YOU1000000162_S0000038	OKAY.
YOU1000000162_S0000040	NOW WE'RE IN SOFT RIGHT NOW. DYNAMIC, CLEAR, BASS.
YOU1000000162_S0000042	HMM.
YOU1000000162_S0000044	OKAY, I'M WONDERING RIGHT NOW IF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TESTED THESE ALREADY HAD THEM IN FULL VOLUME OR NOT.
YOU1000000162_S0000045	CAUSE I READ SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU READ AND THAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE I WAS HAVING UNTIL I MADE SURE THE BUDS THEMSELVES WERE MAX VOLUME AND THE PHONE WAS MAX VOLUME.
YOU1000000162_S0000046	NOW, IT'S A LOT MORE THUMP. WAY MORE BASS. ARE PEOPLE DOING IT WRONG?
YOU1000000162_S0000048	IT'S A HEADPHONE, I'M HEARING INSTRUMENTS. I WAS GONE FOR A MINUTE, DID THE TRICK, SORT OF. I'VE HEARD BETTER. I KINDA FEEL LIKE I GOTTA DO THIS EXACT SAME TRACK RIGHT NOW ON THE AIRPODS.
YOU1000000162_S0000049	RIGHT NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO HURRY UP HURRY UP HURRY UP WAY LESS ISOLATION I HEAR THE THE FAN ON THE CAMERA HERE WE GO BEGINNING
YOU1000000162_S0000050	YOU KNOW, NEITHER ARE BLOWING MY BRAINS OUT. YOU KNOW? OBVIOUSLY, I'VE TRIED SOME VERY EXPENSIVE HEADPHONES IN THIS SPOT, IN THIS SEAT RIGHT HERE.
YOU1000000162_S0000051	WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER, YOU AND I, JACK, KIRK, AND WHOEVER ELSE HAPPENS TO BE BEHIND ME ON ANY GIVEN DAY. THESE ARE TINY DENTAL FLOSS SITUATIONS. LOOK AT THEM.
YOU1000000162_S0000052	IN TERMS OF SOUND, I THINK I CAN SAY BASED ON THAT QUICK LITTLE TEST RIGHT THERE, THE BUDS
YOU1000000162_S0000054	THERE'S A BIT MORE THUMP TO IT. MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE TOO HIGH
YOU1000000162_S0000055	THEY'RE PROBABLY CLOSER TO THIS PERFORMANCE THAN THEY ARE TO LIKE A FULL ON PAIR OF HEADPHONE PERFORMANCE.
YOU1000000162_S0000056	THAT SAID, THE MOST STRIKING DIFFERENCE FOR ME BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE FIT AND THE FEEL, RIGHT?
YOU1000000162_S0000057	AND THE SOUND SEAL. WHEN YOU PUT THESE ON, YOU FEEL ISOLATED, BUT THERE'S A DRAWBACK TO THAT. I NOTICED THEY'RE IN MY EARS A LITTLE BIT MORE.
YOU1000000162_S0000058	THIS, I DON'T EVEN FEEL IT. THIS IS A KIND OF A TIGHTER FEEL. IF I HAD TO CHOOSE, THIS IS A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR MY PARTICULAR EAR CANAL.
YOU1000000162_S0000059	AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON I THINK I KEEP REACHING FOR THE AIRPODS IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOT BECAUSE THEY SOUND THE BEST, BUT BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T EVEN NOTICE YOU'RE WEARING THEM. THAT COULD BE A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING.
YOU1000000162_S0000060	NEITHER ARE GOING TO BE AN AMAZING AUDIO EXPERIENCE, BUT REALLY THESE PRODUCTS ARE ABOUT CONVENIENCE.
YOU1000000162_S0000061	SO EVALUATING THEM ON CONVENIENCE, YOU HAVE TO GIVE CERTAIN POINTS TO THE NEW SAMSUNG PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT CAN CHARGE WIRELESSLY AND OFF OF THE PHONE ITSELF.
YOU1000000162_S0000062	ALSO, THE APP GIVES YOU MORE CONFIGURABILITY. ALSO, ANOTHER THING WORTH NOTING, THE GALAXY BUDS ARE A BIT CHEAPER THAN THE AIRPODS.
YOU1000000162_S0000063	SO THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A SURPRISE. THAT IS A HARD PICK. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. I MEAN IT MIGHT BE SO SIMPLE AS IF YOU'RE ON SAMSUNG OR ON ANDROID YOU MIGHT GO FOR THESE AND IF
YOU1000000162_S0000064	IF YOU'RE ON IOS, YOU'LL PROBABLY GO FOR THESE JUST FOR THE EASIER PAIRING ACROSS DEVICES.
YOU1000000162_S0000065	OH, IT'S A HARD DECISION. I'D SAY IF I'M ABOUT TO DO SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, IF I'M GOING FOR A JOG OR SOMETHING, I DON'T JOG. BUT LIKE, LET'S SAY I DID.
YOU1000000162_S0000066	I WILL PROBABLY REACH FOR THESE ONES, IT'S JUST A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FIT. BUT IF IT'S JUST, IF IT'S IN AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE AROUND THE HOUSE,
YOU1000000162_S0000067	I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF NOT FEELING THE THING IN YOUR EAR. AS STUPID AS THAT LOOKS, YOU FORGET THAT IT'S THERE.
YOU1000000162_S0000068	I ALREADY HAVE SO MANY GREAT SOUNDING HEADPHONES, IF I WANT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS WITH MUSIC, I THINK I'LL PROBABLY STILL REACH FOR THESE MORE BECAUSE OF THAT FACTOR.
YOU1000000162_S0000069	AND THEN ALSO KEEP MY SONY HEADPHONES, THE DEDICATED OVER EAR HEADPHONES WITH THE NOISE CANCELLATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
YOU1000000162_S0000070	KEEP THOSE FOR THE DISCERNING LISTENING, BUT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THOSE OTHER HEADPHONES, AND I NEEDED SOMETHING THAT COULD ISOLATE BETTER THAN THE AIRPODS,
YOU1000000162_S0000071	AND I COULD ONLY HAVE ONE PAIR. I ONLY HAD 130 BUCKS FOR ONE PAIR. I'D PROBABLY GO FOR THESE.
YOU1000000162_S0000072	SO ONLY ON ONE PAIR OF HEADPHONES I PROBABLY WOULD CHOOSE THESE OVER THESE, BUT IN CONJUNCTION WITH A REALLY NICE PAIR THAT YOU USE SOMETIMES,
YOU1000000162_S0000073	THIS IS THE I DON'T EVEN NOTICE I'M WEARING THEM HEADSET. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
YOU1000000163_S0000000	OKAY, SO BACK IN DECEMBER 2018 WE MADE A VIDEO ON ONE OF THE BEST OPTIONS IN TERMS OF SMARTWATCHES FOR ANDROID USERS. AND THAT WAS THIS WATCH, THE MOBVOI TICWATCH PRO.
YOU1000000163_S0000001	AND WHAT WAS REALLY UNIQUE ABOUT THIS SMARTWATCH WAS THAT IT ACTUALLY CAME WITH NOT ONE, BUT TWO DISPLAYS.
YOU1000000163_S0000002	YES, ONE OF THEM BEING AN FSTN PANEL, AND THANKS TO THIS DUAL DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY, THE BATTERY LIFE WAS ABSOLUTELY INSANE.
YOU1000000163_S0000003	SO, UP TO 30 DAYS ON A SMARTWATCH, WHICH WAS SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
YOU1000000163_S0000004	IT CAME WITH THE BEST SPECS YOU COULD GET ON A SMARTWATCH TODAY,
YOU1000000163_S0000005	AT AN INCREDIBLE PRICE OF JUST OVER £200.
YOU1000000163_S0000006	IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE FULL VIDEO ON THE TICWATCH PRO, YOU CAN FIND IT HERE.
YOU1000000163_S0000007	BUT NOW MOBVOI HAS RELEASED A BRAND NEW SMARTWATCH FOR 2019. IT'S CALLED THE TICWATCH E2.
YOU1000000163_S0000008	AND NOT ONLY COMES WITH SOME EXTRA FEATURES EVEN OVER THE PRO, BUT IT'S ALSO EVEN LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE PRO.
YOU1000000163_S0000009	STARTING AT JUST 145 POUNDS.
YOU1000000163_S0000010	AND MOBVOI HAS SENT ONE OVER AS WELL AS SPONSORED THIS VIDEO FOR ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT.
YOU1000000163_S0000011	SO, LET'S SEE HOW GOOD THIS WATCH REALLY IS FOR JUST $160.
YOU1000000163_S0000012	OR £145. IS IT ACTUALLY WORTH IT? I'M QUITE CURIOUS.
YOU1000000163_S0000013	SO GRAB SOME SNACKS AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
YOU1000000163_S0000015	OKAY, SO INSIDE THE BOX WE GET THE WATCH ITSELF, THE QUICK START GUIDE, AS WELL AS THE CHARGER.
YOU1000000163_S0000016	NOW WITH MOST ANDROID SMARTWATCHES, THE CHARGER HAS THOSE CHARGING PINS AND YOU HAVE TO LINE UP MANUALLY THE WATCH WITH THE PINS, WHICH I REALLY DON'T LIKE.
YOU1000000163_S0000017	NOW WITH THE E2, WHILE THE CHARGER DOES HAVE THOSE PINS, THE CHARGER ITSELF IS ACTUALLY MAGNETIC, SO IT AUTOMATICALLY LINES ITSELF UP.
YOU1000000163_S0000018	WITH THE WATCH. OKAY SO WHO IS THE TICWATCH E2 FOR AND WHAT DOES IT DO AND IN THE END IS IT IS IT REALLY WORTH IT?
YOU1000000163_S0000019	WELL, STARTING OFF WITH WHO THIS IS FOR, WHILE THE TICWATCH PRO WAS MOBVOI'S HIGHEST END SMARTWATCH MADE OUT OF STAINLESS STEEL AND WITH A 30 DAY BATTERY LIFE, THE E2 WAS ACTUALLY MADE WITH FITNESS AND SWIMMING IN MIND.
YOU1000000163_S0000020	OKAY, SO IT HAS WEAKER SPECS THAN THE PRO, BUT IT IS BETTER FOR SWIMMING AND FITNESS, RIGHT?
YOU1000000163_S0000021	WELL, TO MY SURPRISE, THE E2 ACTUALLY HAS THE EXACT SAME SPECS AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE TICWATCH PRO, AND IN SOME CASES, IT EVEN OFFERS MORE THAN THE PRO DOES.
YOU1000000163_S0000022	FOR EXAMPLE, EVEN THOUGH THE E2 DOES NOT OFFER THE SAME DUAL DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY AS THE PRO DOES, IT DOES HAVE THE EXACT SAME DISPLAY, THE MAIN DISPLAY, AS THE PRO.
YOU1000000163_S0000023	SO THIS IS A 1.4 INCH AMOLED DISPLAY AT 400X400 PIXELS IN RESOLUTION, WHICH AT THE MOMENT IS ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION DISPLAY ON ANY ANDROID SMARTWATCH. SO TEXT IS RAZOR SHARP ON THIS.
YOU1000000163_S0000024	COLORS JUST POP SO EVERYTHING IS VERY VIBRANT ON THIS DISPLAY AND SINCE THIS IS AN AMOLED PANEL YOU DON'T JUST GET THOSE PERFECT BLACK LEVELS BUT YOU ALSO GET
YOU1000000163_S0000025	YES, AND ALWAYS ON DISPLAY, WHICH IF YOU'RE COMING FROM SOMETHING LIKE AN APPLE WATCH, THIS IS A VERY, VERY WELCOME ADDITION.
YOU1000000163_S0000026	YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO SEE THE TIME ALL THE TIME ON YOUR DISPLAY.
YOU1000000163_S0000027	AND THE BRIGHTNESS IS REALLY GOOD AS WELL, SO I HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES READING THIS IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OUTDOORS, SO YEAH, OVERALL, THIS IS A GREAT DISPLAY.
YOU1000000163_S0000028	IN FACT, THIS IS THE BEST PANEL THAT YOU CAN GET AT THE MOMENT ON ANY ANDROID SMARTWATCH TODAY.
YOU1000000163_S0000029	AND THE TICWATCH A2 ACTUALLY HAS IT AT JUST $160.
YOU1000000163_S0000030	AND INTERESTING ENOUGH, IT'S NOT JUST THE DISPLAY THAT'S GREAT, THE SPECS ARE REALLY GOOD AS WELL.
YOU1000000163_S0000031	WE GET A QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON WEAR 2100 PROCESSOR, WHICH YES, IT IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT THE NEWLY RELEASED 3100 PROCESSOR,
YOU1000000163_S0000032	BUT CONSIDERING ITS PRICE POINTS AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ALMOST NO SMARTWATCHES USING THE 3100 PROCESSORS YET,
YOU1000000163_S0000033	ASIDE FROM 3 WATCHES, THE MONTBLANC SUMMIT II, THE FOSSIL GEN 4 SPORT AND THE LOUIS VUITTON TAMBOUR HORIZON 2ND GEN.
YOU1000000163_S0000034	SO YEAH, THE 2100 IS THE BEST YOU COULD ASK FOR AT THIS PRICE. THE A2 ALSO COMES WITH 512 MB OF RAM.
YOU1000000163_S0000035	AS WELL AS 4GB OF INTERNAL STORAGE. SO, ADD THIS TO THE 2100 PROCESSOR AND THE 400X400 PIXEL 1.4 INCH AMOLED DISPLAY AND THERE YOU GO, YOU HAVE FLAGSHIP LEVEL SPECS.
YOU1000000163_S0000036	ON AN ANDROID SMARTWATCH AND SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY PRICED EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.
YOU1000000163_S0000037	AND PERFORMANCE WISE, I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES AT ALL WITH YEE 2. SO MENUS WERE FLUID, RISK DETECTION HAPPENED IN PRETTY MUCH AN INSTANT.
YOU1000000163_S0000038	APPS OPENED VERY QUICKLY AND ACTIVATING THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT WAS VERY FAST.
YOU1000000163_S0000039	AS WELL. SO YEAH, PERFORMANCE WISE THE E2 GETS MY SEAL OF APPROVAL.
YOU1000000163_S0000040	AND SINCE THE 2 COMES WITH GOOGLE'S OPERATING SYSTEM, SO WEAR OS 2, OUT OF THE BOX, YOU GET THE EXACT SAME FEATURES AS YOU WOULD WITH ALL THE OTHER PREMIUM ANDROID SMARTWATCHES.
YOU1000000163_S0000041	YOU GET ACCESS TO GOOGLE'S FULL WEAR OS PLAY STORE, YOU GET ACCESS TO THOUSANDS OF THIRD PARTY WATCH FACES, AND YOU CAN EVEN MAKE YOUR OWN.
YOU1000000163_S0000042	IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ONE THAT YOU REALLY LIKE. SO YEAH, YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM WATCH FACES IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO SO. SO I REALLY, REALLY LIKE THIS FEATURE, WHICH IS MISSING FROM, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE THE APPLE WATCH.
YOU1000000163_S0000043	AND SPEAKING OF WATCH FACES, THERE ARE THREE OF THEM THAT WERE MADE BY MOBVOI AND COME PRE INSTALLED ON THE TICWATCH E2. AND I REALLY, REALLY LOVE THE WAY THEY LOOK. SO THEY HAVE THIS MINIMALISTIC LOOK.
YOU1000000163_S0000044	WITH RED, BLACK, AND WHITE. SO YEAH, THEY'RE REALLY NICE, NICELY DESIGNED, AND I DO LOVE ALL OF THEM.
YOU1000000163_S0000045	NAVIGATING THROUGH THE MENUS IS ALSO VERY EASY BY THE WAY AND INTUITIVE. SO YOU SWIPE UP TO ACCESS YOUR NOTIFICATIONS, YOU SWIPE DOWN TO ACCESS YOUR CONTROL TOGGLES FOR THINGS SUCH AS BRIGHTNESS,
YOU1000000163_S0000046	LOW BATTERY MODE, AIRPLANE MODE, AND SO ON, DO NOT DISTURB. SO YEAH, PRETTY MUCH JUST LIKE ON YOUR SMARTPHONE. THEN YOU SWIPE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT CARDS.
YOU1000000163_S0000047	SO THINGS SUCH AS THE CURRENT WEATHER, YOUR PLANE TICKETS, YOUR LATEST NEWS, ALL THAT WILL BE THERE. SO YEAH, VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO GOOGLE NOW.
YOU1000000163_S0000048	THEN YOU SWIPE LEFT TO OPEN UP THE FITNESS PANEL THAT SHOWS YOU YOUR STEPS AND CALORIES THAT YOU'VE BURNED.
YOU1000000163_S0000050	FROM THE DAY AND TAPPING ON THIS OPENS UP A DEDICATED TICWATCH WORKOUTS APP.
YOU1000000163_S0000051	AND FINALLY, PRESSING ON THE CROWN OPENS UP THE APP MENU. SO THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR THIRD PARTY APPS AND SYSTEM SETTINGS.
YOU1000000163_S0000052	AND THEN HOLDING ON THE CROWN ACTIVATES THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT, WHICH YOU CAN ALSO ACTIVATE BY USING YOUR VOICE, BY, YOU KNOW, SAYING JUST THE COMMANDS, OK, GOOGLE.
YOU1000000163_S0000053	I'M NOT GONNA HOPEFULLY I HAVEN'T ACTIVATED YOUR DEVICES, BUT YEAH, YOU CAN START ASKING QUESTIONS OR ASK FOR DIRECTIONS
YOU1000000163_S0000054	WETTER, ALL THAT. SO IT'S JUST LIKE USING GOOGLE ASSISTANT ON YOUR SMARTPHONE.
YOU1000000163_S0000055	OKAY, SO GREAT DISPLAY, GREAT PERFORMANCE, BUT WHAT DOES THE E2 DO MORE OVER OTHER ANDROID SMARTWATCHES ASIDE FROM THE VERY LOW PRICE?
YOU1000000163_S0000056	WELL, MANY OTHER ANDROID SMARTWATCHES TODAY ARE WATER RESISTANT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TICWATCH PRO WAS IP68 CERTIFIED, SO UP TO 1.5 METERS SUBMERSION, UP TO 30 MINUTES.
YOU1000000163_S0000057	BUT THE E2 IS A BIT OF A SPECIAL ONE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY, VERY FEW SMARTWATCHES THAT ARE ACTUALLY WATERPROOF. NOT WATER RESISTANT, BUT WATERPROOF.
YOU1000000163_S0000058	SO THE E2 IS WATERPROOF UP TO 5 ATMOSPHERES OF PRESSURE, WHICH IS ABOUT 50 METERS OF DEPTH.
YOU1000000163_S0000059	SO SAME AS WITH AN APPLE WATCH SERIES 2 OR NEWER, YOU CAN TAKE THIS WITH YOU WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING OR EVEN SNORKELING, YES, UP TO 50 METERS.
YOU1000000163_S0000060	SO, THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE POINT. AND E2 EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN BUILT IN EXERCISE APP, THE WORKOUTS APP THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE.
YOU1000000163_S0000061	WHICH DOES INCLUDE A SWIMMING MODE. SO NOW YOU CAN TRACK YOUR PACE, THE DURATION, THE LAPS, AND EVEN THE NUMBER OF STROKES THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN.
YOU1000000163_S0000062	THE E2 ALSO FEATURES A BUILT IN GPS, WHICH NOT A LOT OF SMARTWATCHES DO, ESPECIALLY NOT AT THIS PRICE POINT.
YOU1000000163_S0000063	SO IF YOU JUST WANT TO GO OUT FOR A RUN AND TAKE D2 WITH YOU, THIS ONE IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DOING THAT. SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TRACK YOUR PATH EXACTLY WHERE YOU RUN, YOUR RUN TIME.
YOU1000000163_S0000064	AND SPEAKING OF HEART RATE TRACKING, THE E2 NOW COMES WITH MAVOY'S HEART RATE MONITOR 2.0.
YOU1000000163_S0000065	WHICH ACTUALLY MEASURES YOUR HEART RATE CONTINUOUSLY, SO 24 7, UNTIL, OBVIOUSLY, THE BATTERY DIES.
YOU1000000163_S0000066	SO MOST SMARTWATCHES ONLY MEASURE EVERY HOUR OR EVERY 10 MINUTES OR WHEN YOU'RE DOING A WORKOUT, BUT THE E2 CONSTANTLY MEASURES YOUR HEART RATE AND THEN SHOWS YOU GRAPHS ON HOW YOUR HEART RATE WAS AT DIFFERENT TIMES
YOU1000000163_S0000067	AND SPEAKING OF THE BATTERY, HOW IS IT? WELL, MY VOICE SAYS THAT THE E2 WOULD LAST YOU FOR UP TO 48 HOURS, WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD. NOW, PERSONALLY,
YOU1000000163_S0000068	IT LASTED ME FOR ABOUT A DAY, A DAY AND A HALF, BUT IT DOES DEPEND ON HOW YOU USE IT AND YOU KNOW, WHAT EXACTLY YOU DO WITH YOUR SMARTWATCH.
YOU1000000163_S0000069	BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU GO OUT ON A RUN AND HAVE THE GPS ON AND YOU'RE ALSO TRACKING YOUR WORKOUT, THEN THE BATTERY LIFE WOULD ONLY LAST YOU FOR A FEW HOURS AND THIS APPLIES TO ANY SMARTWATCH, INCLUDING THE APPLE WATCH.
YOU1000000163_S0000070	OKAY, SO, SO FAR, SO GOOD. THE TICWATCH E2 SEEMS LIKE IT CANNOT EXIST AT ITS PRICE POINT.
YOU1000000163_S0000071	SO WHAT'S THE CATCH? WELL, IT DOES NOT HAVE NFC. SO IF YOU'RE INTO GOOGLE PAY, THEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE GOOGLE PAY WITH THE TICWATCH E2.
YOU1000000163_S0000072	AND THEN THE DESIGN IS INDEED QUITE CHUNKY. SO IT'S QUITE A THICK SMARTWATCH,
YOU1000000163_S0000073	BUT ASIDE FROM THESE TWO THINGS, YOU GET A LARGE AMOLED DISPLAY WITH NO NOTCH OR CUTOUTS, YOU GET A HIGHEST RESOLUTION DISPLAY ON ANY ANDROID SMARTWATCH, YOU GET A QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON WEAR 2100 PROCESSOR,
YOU1000000163_S0000074	512 MB OF RAM AND 4 GB OF INTERNAL STORAGE. SO ALL OF THESE ARE FLAGSHIP SPECS. AND THE FACT THAT IT COMES WITH A 24 HOUR HEART RATE MONITOR
YOU1000000163_S0000075	A 50M WATER RESISTANCE AND IT ONLY COSTS $160 AT THE MOMENT SO IT MIGHT EVEN GET CHEAPER AS TIME GOES ON.
YOU1000000163_S0000076	I HONESTLY THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IN TERMS OF ANY SMARTWATCH.
YOU1000000163_S0000077	IF YOU USE THE COUPON CODE ZONOFTECH YOU ACTUALLY GET A 10% DISCOUNT ON BOTH AMAZON AND THE MOBVOI OFFICIAL WEBSITE. BOTH OF THEM LINKED IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW.
YOU1000000163_S0000078	AND PROBABLY THE BEST PART ABOUT THE E2 IS THAT, WELL, IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON IOS AS WELL. SO IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE, YOU CAN GIVE THIS A TRY, YOU CAN USE IT, BECAUSE IT WORKS.
YOU1000000163_S0000079	SO, IF YOU EVER WANTED AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE APPLE WATCH, WELL, THE E2 IS HALF THE COST WHILE OFFERING FEATURES SUCH AS AN ALWAYS ON DISPLAY WHICH THE APPLE WATCH EVEN LACKS.
YOU1000000163_S0000080	BUT NO MATTER IF YOU'RE TEAM IOS OR TEAM ANDROID, IF YOU NEED AN AFFORDABLE SMARTWATCH THAT CAN LITERALLY DO ANYTHING, THIS IS HONESTLY THE BEST OPTION AT THE MOMENT.
YOU1000000163_S0000081	SO YEAH, THIS WAS A REALLY INTERESTING VIDEO TO DO AND IT'S HONESTLY A REALLY INTERESTING PRODUCT. SO YEAH, THANKS TO MAVOY FOR SPONSORING THIS VIDEO. AS ALWAYS, ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.

YOU1000000163_S0000087	WAS IT GOOD? WAS IT WORTH IT? BECAUSE HONESTLY, I REALLY DO THINK SO.

YOU1000000165_S0000002	FOR THIS LIST, WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MOST TALENTED HIGH PROFILE ACTORS, BASED ON THE PERFORMANCES THEY DELIVERED BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019.
YOU1000000165_S0000003	TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH TELEVISION AND FILM.
YOU1000000165_S0000004	WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT THE ACTORS WHO GENERATED THE BIGGEST NUMBERS AT THE BOX OFFICE.
YOU1000000165_S0000005	BUT RATHER THOSE WHO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES AS BEING THE MOST CONSISTENTLY TOP NOTCH, EARNING THE RESPECT OF FANS, CRITICS, AND THEIR PEERS.
YOU1000000165_S0000007	NUMBER 20. ROBERT DOWNEY JR. THERE ARE FEW GREATER STORIES OF REDEMPTION IN SHOW BUSINESS THAN THAT OF THIS ICONIC ACTOR.
YOU1000000165_S0000008	FOLLOWING A ROUGHLY FIVE YEAR STRETCH IN THE LATE 90S AND EARLY 2000S THAT SAW ROBERT DOWNEY JR. LOST TO ADDICTION, HE GOT CLEAN AND BEGAN REBUILDING HIS CAREER.
YOU1000000165_S0000009	IN 2008, AFTER PROVING HIMSELF IN A NUMBER OF CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED ROLES, HE MADE HIS FIRST REAL BLOCKBUSTER FILM, IRON MAN. OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOLLOWING DECADE,

YOU1000000165_S0000011	AND IF ANYBODY EVER DOESN'T LIKE IT, THERE'S THE DOOR.
YOU1000000165_S0000013	AS TONY STARK, ROBERT DOWNEY JR. GAVE US ONE OF THE LONGEST RUNNING CHARACTER EVOLUTIONS IN CINEMATIC HISTORY. AND, THOUGH SOMETIMES OVERLOOKED BECAUSE OF THE GENRE IN WHICH IT PLAYS OUT,
YOU1000000165_S0000014	IT WAS A POWERFUL AND EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN PERFORMANCE, ONE THAT DEFINED THE DECADE.
YOU1000000165_S0000015	NINE...
YOU1000000165_S0000017	YEAH.

YOU1000000165_S0000022	BABY, THIS IS US. YOU AND ME. WE DETERMINE OUR WORTH.
YOU1000000165_S0000024	BABY, YOU ARE A STRONG, PROUD, SURVIVING, SPLENDID BLACK MAN.
YOU1000000165_S0000025	BUT IT'S BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019 THAT SHE TRULY CEMENTED HERSELF AS ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE TALENTS OF HER GENERATION. KING'S BEST WORK HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON TV.

YOU1000000165_S0000036	IT'S YOUR GRANDCHILD.
YOU1000000165_S0000037	WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE HOW HE GETS HERE?
YOU1000000165_S0000038	THOUGH HIS CHARACTER'S ACTIONS OFTEN MADE HIM HARD TO WATCH, ADAM DRIVER DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A TALENTED PERFORMER
YOU1000000165_S0000039	AND ONE TO WATCH OVER THE COURSE OF THE SIX SEASONS OF GIRLS. AFTER RISING TO PROMINENCE ON THE SERIES, HE PROMPTLY BEGAN PICKING UP INCREASINGLY SIGNIFICANT ROLES.
YOU1000000165_S0000040	FROM HIS SUPPORTING PART IN 2012'S LINCOLN TO A CO STARRING ROLE IN MARTIN SCORSESE'S SILENCE.

YOU1000000165_S0000042	AND A STAR IN BLOCKBUSTER FILMS. BUT DRIVER CAN APPARENTLY DO IT ALL.
YOU1000000165_S0000043	ANYTHING ELSE?
YOU1000000165_S0000045	THE TWO WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A GIRL.
YOU1000000165_S0000047	LIKE GIRLS.
YOU1000000165_S0000048	AS KYLO REN, HE STEPPED INTO ONE OF THE BIGGEST FRANCHISES OF ALL TIME.
YOU1000000165_S0000049	WHILE HIS PERFORMANCES IN FILMS LIKE SILENCE, BLACK KLANSMAN AND MARRIAGE STORY HAVE EARNED HIM NUMEROUS ACCOLADES.
YOU1000000165_S0000050	AND I LOVED YOU AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE YOU. BUT I'M IN MY 20S! AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE THAT TOO, AND I KIND OF DID!
YOU1000000165_S0000051	NUMBER 17. JENNIFER LAWRENCE SPEAKING OF ACTORS WHO CAN SCORE BIG BOTH AT THE BOX OFFICE AND IN TERMS OF AWARD NOMINATIONS,
YOU1000000165_S0000052	JENNIFER LAWRENCE HAS MADE AN IMPACT LIKE FEW OTHERS.
YOU1000000165_S0000053	THE HUNGER GAMES FRANCHISE, IN WHICH SHE STARRED AS HEROINE KATNISS, PULLED IN NEARLY $3 BILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE.
YOU1000000165_S0000054	I'M A VOLUNTEER! I'M A VOLUNTEER!
YOU1000000165_S0000056	I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE.
YOU1000000165_S0000057	THIS DECADE ALSO SAW HER PLAYING A VERY PROMINENT ROLE IN THE X MEN FRANCHISE AS MYSTIQUE. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, SHE'S SIMULTANEOUSLY STARRED IN A NUMBER OF CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED DRAMAS.
YOU1000000165_S0000058	WHICH HAVE CUMULATIVELY SEEN HER NOMINATED FOR FOUR ACADEMY AWARDS, INCLUDING A BEST ACTRESS WIN FOR HER STARRING ROLE IN 2012'S SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.
YOU1000000165_S0000059	THAT'S GREAT FOR ALL OF THEM, BUT ALL OF THEM DIDN'T MAKE A COMMITMENT TO ME IN RETURN FOR MY HELP.
YOU1000000165_S0000061	I'M TIFFANY, BY THE WAY.
YOU1000000165_S0000062	ACROSS THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECOGNIZE ACTING, SHE'S EARNED A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF AWARD NOMINATIONS, MOST OF THEM OVER THE 2010S, BEFORE THE AGE OF 30.
YOU1000000165_S0000063	NUMBER 16 SCARLETT JOHANSSON
YOU1000000165_S0000064	NOTHING SOLIDIFIES YOUR STATUS AS ONE OF THE ACTING GREATS QUITE LIKE ENDING OFF THE DECADE WITH A BEST ACTRESS AND BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS NOMINATION IN THE SAME YEAR.
YOU1000000165_S0000065	ALONGSIDE ROBERT DOWNEY JR., SCARJO IS A MEMBER OF THE TEAM THAT REDEFINED THE SUPERHERO GENRE OVER THE LAST DECADE AS THE INFINITY SAGA PLAYED OUT.
YOU1000000165_S0000066	WHEN FILMING ONE JUGGERNAUT MCU FILM AFTER ANOTHER, SHE'S KEPT HER RESUME BALANCED WITH MORE GROUNDED ROLES. NOT TO MENTION DARING AND EXPERIMENTAL ONES.
YOU1000000165_S0000068	HER WILLINGNESS TO SIGN UP FOR SCI FI AND ACTION FILMS HAS LIMITED HER AWARD POTENTIAL OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS.
YOU1000000165_S0000069	BUT EVERY TIME SHE DOES STEP INTO A CHALLENGING ROLE, JOHANSSON REMINDS US SHE'S AN A LISTER IN EVERY WAY.
YOU1000000165_S0000070	I WAS EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT IN FRONT OF HIM, BUT IT WAS ALSO LIKE...
YOU1000000165_S0000072	YEAH. THIS IS WHO I AM. AND THIS IS WHAT I'M WORTH.
YOU1000000165_S0000073	NUMBER 15 MARGOT ROBBIE
YOU1000000165_S0000074	IT MIGHT BE HARD TO BELIEVE CONSIDERING HER CURRENT POP CULTURE OMNIPRESENCE, BUT LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE, THIS TALENTED ACTOR ENDED THE DECADE WHILE STILL IN HER 20S.
YOU1000000165_S0000075	MARGOT ROBBIE WAS CATAPULTED INTO THE SPOTLIGHT WITH THE WOLF OF WALL STREET.
YOU1000000165_S0000076	NO, DADDY DOESN'T EVEN GET TO TOUCH MOMMY FOR A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME.
YOU1000000165_S0000077	AND, DESPITE IT BEING A SUPPORTING ROLE, SHE PROVED HERSELF TO BE AN ABSOLUTE SCENE STEALER. SINCE THEN, SHE'S FURTHER DISTINGUISHED HERSELF AS AN EXTREMELY VERSATILE ACTOR.
YOU1000000165_S0000078	REGARDLESS OF HOW A FILM PERFORMS, BE IT AT THE BOX OFFICE OR WITH CRITICS, SHE SHINES BRIGHT. HER PERFORMANCE AS HARLEY QUINN IN SUICIDE SQUAD
YOU1000000165_S0000079	AS WELL AS IN FILMS LIKE MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, BOMBSHELL AND I, TONYA HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY POWERFUL.
YOU1000000165_S0000080	WITH THE LATTER RIGHTFULLY EARNING HER AN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION FOR BEST ACTRESS.
YOU1000000165_S0000081	NOT EVERY ACTOR HAS THEIR TALENTS RECOGNIZED IN THEIR 20S. AN ESTABLISHED TV PERFORMER, MAHERSHALA ALI
YOU1000000165_S0000082	FIRST REALLY CAUGHT THE EYE OF CINEMA GOERS IN 2008'S THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON. AS THE NEW DECADE BEGAN, HOWEVER, HIS NAME RECOGNITION AND CLOUT QUICKLY SNOWBALLED.
YOU1000000165_S0000083	HIS SUPPORTING ROLE IN THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES GARNERED PRAISE, AND HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF LANDING ROLES LIKE BOGGS IN THE HUNGER GAMES FRANCHISE, AND REMY DANTON IN HOUSE OF CARDS.
YOU1000000165_S0000084	THE MORE THEY GIVE, THE MORE YOU CAN DO. THE MORE YOU CAN DO, THE BETTER THEY LOOK.
YOU1000000165_S0000085	2016 WAS A REAL TURNING POINT THOUGH. MOONLIGHT ENABLED HIM TO SHOWCASE THE DEPTH OF HIS ACTING ABILITY.
YOU1000000165_S0000086	WHAT YOU DOING IN HERE, LITTLE MAN?
YOU1000000165_S0000088	HUH?
YOU1000000165_S0000090	DO YOU WANNA TALK TO STRANGERS?
YOU1000000165_S0000092	IT'S COOL. WE COOL.
YOU1000000165_S0000093	HE WON THE OSCAR FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR AND AGAIN TWO YEARS LATER FOR 2018'S GREEN BOOK.
YOU1000000165_S0000094	AND ALSO STARRED IN THE THIRD SEASON OF THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED TRUE DETECTIVE.
YOU1000000165_S0000096	NUMBER 13. SAOIRSE RONAN
YOU1000000165_S0000097	I WANT TO GO WHERE CULTURE IS, LIKE NEW YORK, OR AT LEAST CONNECTICUT OR NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE WRITERS LIVE IN THE WOODS.
YOU1000000165_S0000098	THOSE SCHOOLS ANYWAY.
YOU1000000165_S0000099	JUST LOOK AT THAT ACTING RESUME.
YOU1000000165_S0000100	BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCES THAT SHE'S DELIVERED IN FILMS LIKE LADY BIRD, BROOKLYN, AND MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, SAOIRSE RONAN HAS ESTABLISHED HERSELF AS AN INCREDIBLY VERSATILE YET CONSISTENT ACTOR.
YOU1000000165_S0000101	SHE CAN PLAY AN IMMATURE CHARACTER WITHOUT MAKING THEM SEEM TWO DIMENSIONAL, AND YET SHE'S EQUALLY CONFIDENT WHEN PLAYING A ROYAL WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ON HER SHOULDERS.
YOU1000000165_S0000102	IN 2008, SHE WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS FOR HER ROLE IN ATONEMENT. OVER THE LAST DECADE, SHE'S ADDED THREE MORE OSCAR NOMINATIONS.
YOU1000000165_S0000103	INCLUDING THE BEST ACTRESS IN LITTLE WOMEN AND THREE GOLDEN GLOBE NOMS, INCLUDING A WIN FOR HER ROLE AS LADY BIRD. THE SKY'S THE LIMIT FOR RONAN.
YOU1000000165_S0000104	NUMBER 12. DANIEL DAY LEWIS
YOU1000000165_S0000105	I CAN'T ACCOMPLISH A GODDAMN THING OF ANY HUMAN MEANING OR WORTH UNTIL WE CURE OURSELVES OF SLAVERY.
YOU1000000165_S0000106	AND END THIS PESTILENTIAL WAR!
YOU1000000165_S0000107	THIS ICON ONLY APPEARED IN TWO FILMS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST DECADE. BUT DANIEL DAY LEWIS IS NOT A PERFORMER WHOSE WORTH IS MEASURED IN QUANTITY, BUT RATHER QUALITY.
YOU1000000165_S0000108	HECK, SINCE 1989 HE'S ONLY ACTED IN 13 FILMS, AND 9 OF THOSE HAVE RESULTED IN MAJOR AWARD NOMINATIONS.
YOU1000000165_S0000109	HE'S BEEN NOMINATED FOR BEST ACTOR BY THE ACADEMY A STAGGERING SIX TIMES.
YOU1000000165_S0000110	AND HAS A 50% RATE OF WINNING. DANIEL DAY LEWIS IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE AMONG THE GREATEST LIVING ACTORS.
YOU1000000165_S0000111	AND SO, DESPITE ONLY TURNING IN TWO ROLES THIS DECADE, HE NONETHELESS MADE A SIGNIFICANT MARK ON IT.
YOU1000000165_S0000112	2012'S LINCOLN WAS ONE OF HIS GREATEST PERFORMANCES TO DATE. AND WHILE PHANTOM THREAD HAS LESS WIDE APPEAL, DAY LEWIS STILL RECEIVED UNIVERSAL ACCLAIM FOR HIS PERFORMANCE.
YOU1000000165_S0000113	WHAT GAME AM I PLAYING? WHAT GAME? WHAT PRECISELY IS THE NATURE OF MY GAME? YOU TELL ME.
YOU1000000165_S0000114	NUMBER 11. BRADLEY COOPER THIS GUY HAS CERTAINLY COME A LONG WAY.
YOU1000000165_S0000115	HE WENT FROM A GUEST ROLE ON SEX AND THE CITY, TO PLAYING THE BAD GUY IN WEDDING CRASHERS, TO BREAKING THROUGH WITH THE HANGOVER.
YOU1000000165_S0000116	BEFORE ULTIMATELY ESTABLISHING HIMSELF AS AN A LISTER AND HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER DRAMATIC LEADING MAN.
YOU1000000165_S0000117	HE FIRST REALLY SHOWED US HIS WORTH IN 2012, WHEN HE HIT US WITH THE DOUBLE WHAMMY OF SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK AND THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES.
YOU1000000165_S0000118	I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE NIKKI'S TEACHING THAT BOOK TO THE KIDS. I MEAN, IT'S THE WHOLE TIME. LET ME JUST BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU. THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE ROOTING FOR THIS HEMINGWAY GUY TO SURVIVE THE WAR AND TO BE WITH THE WOMAN THAT HE LOVES, CATHERINE BARKLEY.
YOU1000000165_S0000119	SINCE THEN, HE'S DELIVERED ONE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED PERFORMANCE AFTER ANOTHER, EARNING FOUR ACTING OSCAR NOMINATIONS.
YOU1000000165_S0000120	AMONG HIS MOST NOTABLE ROLES WAS THAT OF CHRIS KYLE IN THE 2015 BIOPIC, AMERICAN SNIPER.
YOU1000000165_S0000121	HE ALSO DIRECTED, STARRED, AND SANG ALONGSIDE LADY GAGA IN THE SMASH, A STAR IS BORN.
YOU1000000165_S0000122	THAT'S THE THING ABOUT WHEN YOU GET FAMOUS, PEOPLE START SAYING YOUR FULL NAME.
YOU1000000165_S0000123	NUMBER 10. LUPITA NYONG'O
YOU1000000165_S0000124	AND YOU KNOW WHY. I GOT THIS FROM MRS. SCHOLL.
YOU1000000165_S0000126	MRS. HEPS WON'T EVEN GRANT ME NO SOAP TO CLEAN WITH. I STINK SO MUCH I MAKE MYSELF GAG!
YOU1000000165_S0000127	HOW MANY ACTORS CAN YOU NAME WHO WON AN ACADEMY AWARD FOR THEIR VERY FIRST FEATURE FILM?
YOU1000000165_S0000129	NOT MANY, BUT SUCH HAS BEEN THE METEORIC RISE OF THIS INCREDIBLY TALENTED PERFORMER. LUPITA NYONG'O WAS BORN IN MEXICO CITY, BUT RAISED IN HER FATHER'S NATIVE KENYA.
YOU1000000165_S0000130	AFTER STUDYING IN THE UNITED STATES, SHE RETURNED THERE AND GOT HER FIRST BREAK IN THE WORLDWIDE MTV SERIES, SUGAR.
YOU1000000165_S0000131	AFTER BEING SUDDENLY THRUST INTO THE SPOTLIGHT WITH HER BREAKTHROUGH PERFORMANCE IN 12 YEARS A SLAVE, HOWEVER,
YOU1000000165_S0000132	SHE'S PROVEN MANY TIMES OVER THAT HER PLACE AMONGST THE HOLLYWOOD ELITE IS WELL DESERVED. HER PERFORMANCE IN QUEEN OF KATWE GARNERED UNIVERSAL PRAISE.
YOU1000000165_S0000133	HER ROLE AS NAKIA IN BLACK PANTHER ESTABLISHED HER AS AN ACTION STAR, WHILE HER DUAL PERFORMANCE IN US IS NOTHING SHORT OF JAW DROPPING.
YOU1000000165_S0000134	IT'S OUR TIME NOW.
YOU1000000165_S0000136	HOW DID I GET THERE?
YOU1000000165_S0000137	NUMBER 9. TOM HARDY
YOU1000000165_S0000138	MY NAME'S CHARLES BRUNSON.
YOU1000000165_S0000140	AND ALL MY LIFE I'VE WANTED TO BE FAMOUS.
YOU1000000165_S0000141	IN 2008, THIS ENGLISH ACTOR CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF CINEPHILES AND CRITICS WITH HIS POWERFUL PERFORMANCE IN THE INDIE BIOPIC BRONSON.
YOU1000000165_S0000142	HE THEN PROCEEDED TO KICK OFF THE NEW DECADE WITH A BREAKOUT ROLE IN INCEPTION.
YOU1000000165_S0000143	AT WHICH POINT THERE WAS SEEMINGLY NO STOPPING HIM. WARRIOR, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, THE REVENANT, MAD MAX FURY ROAD, AND THAT'S NOT EVEN INCLUDING HIS TELEVISION WORK.
YOU1000000165_S0000144	AN INCREDIBLY PHYSICAL ACTOR, WHO'S ABLE TO CONVEY COMPLEX AND INTENSE EMOTION EVEN WHEN SAYING FEW WORDS. TOM HARDY SHINES IN BLOCKBUSTERS AND SMALLER FILMS ALIKE.
YOU1000000165_S0000145	ONE NEED ONLY LOOK AT HIS POLAR CONTRASTING ROLES IN WARRIOR AND LOCKE, THE LATTER SET ENTIRELY IN A CAR, TO APPRECIATE HIS VERSATILITY. IF ONLY THE ACADEMY WOULD PAY ATTENTION MORE OFTEN.
YOU1000000165_S0000146	I JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
YOU1000000165_S0000148	IT'S A JOKE, IS IT?
YOU1000000165_S0000150	LOOK, I KNOW IT'S A SHOCK, BUT IT WILL BE OKAY.
YOU1000000165_S0000151	THE EARLY 2010S WERE TRULY A MCCONAISSANCE. IT WAS MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY'S WORLD. EVERYONE ELSE WAS JUST LIVING IN IT.
YOU1000000165_S0000152	AFTER TOO OFTEN BEING DISMISSED AS A ROM COM HUNK FOR SOME OF THE PREVIOUS TWO DECADES, MCCONAUGHEY STARTED DEMANDING RESPECT ANEW WITH 2011'S THE LINCOLN LAWYER.
YOU1000000165_S0000153	YOU THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE TO REGRET ME OR MY FAMILY, HUH?
YOU1000000165_S0000154	ALL I SAID WAS SHE'S PRETTY.
YOU1000000165_S0000156	ARE YOU SCARED, LOUIS?
YOU1000000165_S0000158	IS WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000165_S0000160	YOU'RE IN A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE.
YOU1000000165_S0000161	IT WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE, BUT FEW COULD HAVE PREDICTED JUST HOW MUCH STELLAR ACTING LAY ON THE HORIZON. KILLER JOE, MUD, AND DALLAS BUYERS CLUB FOLLOWED SOON AFTER.
YOU1000000165_S0000162	WITH THE LATTER EARNING HIM THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST ACTOR. ADD TO THAT HIS PERFORMANCE IN TRUE DETECTIVE, AMONG MANY OTHERS, AND HIS IMMENSE TALENT BECOMES UNDENIABLE.
YOU1000000165_S0000163	HAD WE BEEN MAKING THIS LIST IN 2015, HE LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE TOP FIVE, BUT SOME OF HIS MORE RECENT FILMS HAVE ADMITTEDLY BEEN LESS WELL RECEIVED.
YOU1000000165_S0000164	NUMBER 7. EMMA STONE
YOU1000000165_S0000165	AFTER HER ROLES IN SUPERBAD AND ZOMBIELAND, EMMA STONE WAS FAIRLY RECOGNIZABLE, THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY DESTINED FOR THE A LIST JUST YET.
YOU1000000165_S0000166	THEN IN 2010, SHE STARRED IN A LITTLE TEEN COMEDY CALLED EASY A, AND EVERYTHING CHANGED.
YOU1000000165_S0000167	LET ME JUST BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY, AND THIS IS MY SIDE. THE RIGHT ONE.
YOU1000000165_S0000168	STONE WAS ABSOLUTELY MAGNETIC AS ALL OF PENDERGAST. AND LIKE THAT, A STAR WAS BORN. ONE THAT WOULD RAPIDLY RISE OVER THE COURSE OF THE DECADE.
YOU1000000165_S0000169	THE HELP FOLLOWED IN 2011, FOR WHICH SHE EARNED CRITICAL PRAISE, BEFORE REALLY HITTING HER STRIDE WITH BIRDMAN, LA LA LAND, AND THE FAVOURITE.
YOU1000000165_S0000170	WHICH WERE ALL RELEASED BETWEEN 2014 AND 2018.
YOU1000000165_S0000171	YOU HAD A CAREER, DAD, BEFORE THE THIRD COMIC BOOK MOVIE. BEFORE PEOPLE STARTED TO FORGET WHO WAS INSIDE THAT BIRD COSTUME.
YOU1000000165_S0000172	YOU ARE DOING A PLAY BASED ON A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN 60 YEARS AGO FOR A THOUSAND RICH OLD WHITE PEOPLE WHOSE ONLY REAL CONCERN IS GOING TO BE WHERE THEY GO TO HAVE THEIR CAKE AND COFFEE WHEN IT'S OVER.
YOU1000000165_S0000173	THE AFOREMENTIONED FILMS EARNED STONE THREE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS AND FIVE GOLDEN GLOBE NODS.
YOU1000000165_S0000174	WITH A BEST ACTRESS OSCAR AND A GOLDEN GLOBE TO HER NAME, SHE IS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.
YOU1000000165_S0000175	NUMBER 6. RYAN GOSLING SPEAKING OF LA LA LAND, THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY GREAT PERFORMANCES THIS TALENTED HEARTTHROB AND FORMER CHILD STAR TURNED IN OVER THE 2010S.
YOU1000000165_S0000176	I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NEW MAN. A MAN THAT'S HAPPY TO BE HERE. EXCELLENT. VERY EASY TO WORK WITH.
YOU1000000165_S0000177	AFTER DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF WITH HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE 2006 FILM HALF NELSON, GOSLING REALLY HIT HIS STRIDE IN 2010 WITH BLUE VALENTINE.
YOU1000000165_S0000178	I'M BEING A MAN NOW. COME HERE. HOLD ON. THIS IS WHAT MAGIC'S LIKE. I'M TIRED OF TALKING TO YOU. I'M FUCKING TIRED OF TALKING TO YOU.
YOU1000000165_S0000180	FROM THAT POINT ON, THE GREAT ROLES JUST KEPT ON COMING. 2011 SAW HIM STARRING IN DRIVE AND THE IDES OF MARCH, FOLLOWED BY THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES IN 2012.
YOU1000000165_S0000181	AND WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MISFIRES, THE BIG SHORT, LA LA LAND, BLADE RUNNER 2049, AND FIRST MAN ROUND OUT A DECADE OF UNCOMPROMISING PERFORMANCES FROM THIS STAR.
YOU1000000165_S0000182	HIS 2016 GOLDEN GLOBE WAS WELL EARNED, BUT AN OSCAR IS OVERDUE.
YOU1000000165_S0000183	MANY AN ACTOR HAS COMMITTED LIFE AND LIMB TO A ROLE,
YOU1000000165_S0000184	BUT THERE'S ARGUABLY NO ACTOR WHO INVESTS MORE OF THEMSELVES IN A CHARACTER THAN CHRISTIAN BALE.
YOU1000000165_S0000185	AND I'M A KID BROTHER.
YOU1000000165_S0000187	HIS LIFE'S PRETTY FACE IN THE ROAD. YOU CAN'T GET USED TO LOSING, IT'S A MENTAL THING. BUT WE'RE GONNA BREAK THAT WITH MAMBY, RIGHT?
YOU1000000165_S0000188	WANT HIM TO BE DEATHLY THIN? NO PROBLEM. OVERWEIGHT? YOU CAN DO THAT. IN PEAK PHYSICAL SHAPE? WITH ENOUGH NOTICE, CONSIDER IT DONE. WHILE HE'S FAMOUS FOR RADICALLY CHANGING HIS BODY TO SUIT A ROLE,
YOU1000000165_S0000189	THAT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO OVERSHADOW HIS INCREDIBLE ACTING ABILITY.
YOU1000000165_S0000191	AS IT SO OFTEN DOES. HIS SUPPORTING ROLE IN THE FIGHTER WAS ABSOLUTELY CAPTIVATING. THE GOLDEN GLOBE AND OSCAR SIMPLY COULD NOT HAVE GONE TO ANYONE ELSE.
YOU1000000165_S0000192	AND THROUGHOUT THE DECADE, HE'S CONTINUED TO DELIVER IN A VERY CONSISTENT MANNER.
YOU1000000165_S0000193	INCLUDING STANDOUT PERFORMANCES IN AMERICAN HUSTLE, THE BIG SHORT, VICE, AND FORD V FERRARI.
YOU1000000165_S0000194	THIS AMERICAN ACTRESS OFTEN FLIES UNDER THE RADAR.
YOU1000000165_S0000195	EVEN WHILE TURNING IN SOME OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES OF THE DECADE. BECAUSE BASED ON HER FILMOGRAPHY, SHE SHOULD BE AT THE CENTER OF ATTENTION PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS.
YOU1000000165_S0000196	ADAMS KICKED OFF THE DECADE WITH A BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS NOMINATION FOR THE FIGHTER, AND GOT THE SAME NOD IN 2013 FOR HER ROLE IN THE MASTER.
YOU1000000165_S0000197	THE NEXT YEAR SHE WAS NOMINATED BEST ACTRESS FOR HER ROLE IN AMERICAN HUSTLE.
YOU1000000165_S0000198	BEFORE LANDING YET ANOTHER BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS OSCAR NOD FOR VICE.
YOU1000000165_S0000199	SO CAN YOU CHANGE?
YOU1000000165_S0000201	CAN YOU CHANGE OR AM I WASTING MY GODDAMN TIME?
YOU1000000165_S0000202	THOUGH SHE'S YET TO WIN THE ACADEMY AWARD SHE DESERVES, SHE DOES HAVE TWO GOLDEN GLOBES FOR BEST ACTRESS. AND QUITE FRANKLY, THE LACK OF RECOGNITION FOR HER ROLE IN ARRIVAL IS CRIMINAL.
YOU1000000165_S0000203	NUMBER 3. JAKE GYLLENHAAL
YOU1000000165_S0000204	NOT UNLIKE AMY ADAMS, THIS ACCLAIMED ACTOR TENDS TO KEEP A RELATIVELY LOWER PROFILE FOR SOMEONE OF HIS STATUS. BUT HIS FILMOGRAPHY REVEALS JUST HOW TALENTED AN ACTOR HE REALLY IS.
YOU1000000165_S0000205	ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST DECADE. HE KICKED OFF THE 2010S WITH THE CRITICALLY LAUDED BUT UNDERRATED SOURCE CODE
YOU1000000165_S0000206	BEFORE BLOWING CRITICS AWAY IN A WIDE VARIETY OF FILMS INCLUDING END OF WATCH, PRISONERS, WILDLIFE AND MORE.
YOU1000000165_S0000207	THE ACADEMY HASN'T SHOWN HIM MUCH LOVE SINCE BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, WHICH IS QUITE FRANKLY SHOCKING CONSIDERING HIS PERFORMANCE IN NIGHTCRAWLER WAS AMONG THE YEAR'S BEST.
YOU1000000165_S0000208	I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB.
YOU1000000165_S0000210	IN FACT, I'VE MADE UP MY MIND TO FIND A CAREER THAT I CAN LEARN AND GROW INTO. WHO AM I? I'M A HARD WORKER. I SET HIGH GOALS, AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I'M PERSISTENT.
YOU1000000165_S0000211	HE'S JUST ABOUT THE LAST ACTOR WE EXPECTED TO SEE BATTLING SPIDEY, BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, HE'S JUST AS GOOD IN A MASSIVE BLOCKBUSTER AS IN A GRITTY DRAMA OR A PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER.
YOU1000000165_S0000212	TO PETER PARKER!
YOU1000000165_S0000214	POOR KID.
YOU1000000165_S0000216	LET'S GET TO WORK.
YOU1000000165_S0000217	NUMBER 2. LEONARDO DICAPRIO MANY HAVE CALLED HIM THE GREATEST ACTOR OF HIS GENERATION.
YOU1000000165_S0000218	NO ONE NEEDS TO BE REMINDED OF THE MANY AWARD WINNING FILMS HE STARRED IN OVER THE YEARS, BUT SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LAST DECADE...
YOU1000000165_S0000219	LET'S REVIEW HIS ASTONISHING FEATURE FILMOGRAPHY.
YOU1000000165_S0000220	7 FILMS, MOSTLY OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. AND EVEN WHEN ANY OF HIS FILMS FALTER, THIS MASTER OF HIS CRAFT NEVER FAILS TO TURN IN A SOLID PERFORMANCE.
YOU1000000165_S0000221	AS THE REVENANT AND THE WOLF OF WALL STREET REMIND US, HE'S ALSO VERY VERSATILE. WHEN HE STEPS INTO A CHARACTER, HE TRULY BRINGS THEM TO LIFE.
YOU1000000165_S0000222	THE SHOW GOES ON!
YOU1000000165_S0000224	THIS IS MY HOME!
YOU1000000165_S0000225	SO, I GUESS WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS, IF SOME OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T ALREADY HAVE OSCARS, THEY WILL SOON. HAS YOUR FAVORITE ACTOR APPEARED ON THIS LIST SO FAR? IF NOT, HE OR SHE MIGHT SOON.
YOU1000000165_S0000226	LET'S LOOK AT THE HONORABLE MENTIONS, AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHO CLOCKS IN AT NUMBER ONE ACTOR OF THE LAST DECADE.
YOU1000000165_S0000228	WHAT?
YOU1000000165_S0000230	IT WAS PERFECT.
YOU1000000165_S0000231	I'VE BEEN RIGHT HERE WITH YOU, TROY. I GOT A LIFE, TOO. I GAVE 18 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO STAND IN THE SAME SPOT AS YOU.
YOU1000000165_S0000233	DON'T YOU THINK I EVER WANTED OTHER THINGS? DON'T YOU THINK I HAD DREAMS AND HOPES?
YOU1000000165_S0000234	I AIN'T NEVER INTENDED TO BE NO HOUSEWIFE NOR SLAVE IN TAKING THIS JOB. AND IT AIN'T RIGHT.
YOU1000000165_S0000236	THESE LODGES IS MORE RAMSHACKLE THAN ANY SHANTY BOYS CAMP I EVER SEEN.
YOU1000000165_S0000237	THOSE ARE PICTURES OF REAL THINGS. AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF YOU SEE ON THERE, THAT'S REAL TOO.
YOU1000000165_S0000239	IT'S REAL OCEANS, REAL TREES, REAL CATS.
YOU1000000165_S0000240	NO WAY! WHAT WOULD THEY ALL THINK?
YOU1000000165_S0000241	THEY JUST DO. THEY JUST FIT. THEY JUST FIT OUT IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000165_S0000242	I LIVED MY ENTIRE LIFE WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT.
YOU1000000165_S0000244	I TRAIN, I LIE, I KILL.
YOU1000000165_S0000246	JUST KIDDING.

YOU1000000165_S0000250	NUMBER 1. JOAQUIN PHOENIX
YOU1000000165_S0000251	IN 2008, PHOENIX ANNOUNCED HE WAS RETIRING FROM ACTING. THANKFULLY, IT WAS AN ELABORATE RUSE FOR THE 2010 MOCKUMENTARY, I'M STILL HERE.
YOU1000000165_S0000252	THOUGH THE DIVISIVE FILM WAS A MISSTEP THAT COULD HAVE PERMANENTLY DERAILED A CAREER.
YOU1000000165_S0000253	PHOENIX PROMPTLY RECOVERED, BEGINNING WITH PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON'S THE MASTER IN 2012, WHICH EARNED HIM A BEST ACTOR OSCAR NOMINATION.
YOU1000000165_S0000254	THERE HAVE BEEN PRECIOUS FEW ROLES SINCE FOR WHICH HE HASN'T BEEN HEAPED WITH PRAISE. BE IT IN A SMALLER INDIE FILM OR A BOX OFFICE SMASH LIKE JOKER.
YOU1000000165_S0000255	MY WHOLE LIFE, I DIDN'T KNOW IF I EVEN REALLY EXISTED.
YOU1000000165_S0000257	BUT I DO.
YOU1000000165_S0000259	AND PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO NOTICE.
YOU1000000165_S0000260	LIKE LEO, WHATEVER ROLE PHOENIX TAKES ON, HE FULLY INHABITS.
YOU1000000165_S0000261	WHETHER A MUDDLED STONER, A PARALYZED ALCOHOLIC CARTOONIST, OR A VILLAINOUS LONER, HE MAKES THEM ALL FEEL FULLY REALIZED.
YOU1000000165_S0000262	COMMANDING AUDIENCES WITH HIS VERSATILITY AND INTENSITY. DO YOU AGREE WITH OUR PICKS?

YOU1000000166_S0000000	BABY YODA
YOU1000000166_S0000002	BABY YODA
YOU1000000166_S0000004	BABY YODA.
YOU1000000166_S0000006	BABY YODA, GRANDPA YODA.
YOU1000000166_S0000008	GRAMPY YODA
YOU1000000166_S0000010	GRAMPY YODA!
YOU1000000166_S0000012	GRAMPY YODA, DARTH VADER.
YOU1000000166_S0000014	DARTH VADER
YOU1000000166_S0000016	DARTH VADER
YOU1000000166_S0000018	DARTH VADER, FORCE... OH, JOKEY!
YOU1000000166_S0000020	JOKING!
YOU1000000166_S0000022	FORCE CHOKING!
YOU1000000166_S0000024	ARE... JOKING! I ALWAYS HATED THAT SONG.
YOU1000000166_S0000026	HELLO INTERNET! WELCOME TO FILM THEORY! THE SHOW THAT TAKES THE INTERNET'S MOST ADORABLE MEME OBSESSION...
YOU1000000166_S0000027	AND THEN TURNS IT INTO COLD, HARD, EMOTIONLESS LEARNING. AS MUCH AS WE ALL BADMOUTH THE EMPIRE, HEADING UP AN INTERGALACTIC GOVERNMENT,
YOU1000000166_S0000028	IT'S GOTTA BE A HARD JOB. SET THE RETIREMENT AGE TO 55, AND YODA GETS TO RETIRE BEFORE HE CAN BARELY STRING A SENTENCE TOGETHER BACKWARDS.
YOU1000000166_S0000029	DO, OR DO NOT. THERE IS NO TRY.
YOU1000000166_S0000030	BUT IF YOU SET THE RETIREMENT AGE TO LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, 550, HAN SOLO'S NEVER GONNA SEE HIS PENSION.
YOU1000000166_S0000032	I WONDER THERE WAS A REBELLION AGAINST THESE GUYS. NOW, IN CASE YOU AREN'T HIP WITH THE KIDS LATELY OR DIDN'T TRAMPLE YOUR LOVED ONES IN YOUR RUSH TO SIGN UP FOR DISNEY+,
YOU1000000166_S0000033	I'M TALKING ABOUT BABY YODA, THE TINY, CUDDLY, WOBBLY BUBBAKINS OF THE NEW DISNEY PLUS SHOW, THE MANDALORIAN.
YOU1000000166_S0000034	THE BABY VERSION OF A MEMBER OF YODA'S SPECIES WHO IS, IN ONE EPISODE, ALREADY THE MOST ENDEARING CHARACTER IN THIS FRANCHISE.
YOU1000000166_S0000035	MOVE ASIDE, PORGS! GET THE BOOT, EWOKS! BABY YODA FILLED THE VOID THAT YOU NEVER COULD.
YOU1000000166_S0000036	BABY YODA IS LIKE CUTE CEPTION, BUT THE KICKER IS THAT BY OUR STANDARDS, HE'S NOT EVEN A BABY. THE MANDALORIAN DEPICTS HIM AS A 50 YEAR OLD TODDLER.
YOU1000000166_S0000037	THEIR AGE, THAT'S ALL YOU CAN GIVE ME?
YOU1000000166_S0000038	YES, THEY ARE 50 YEARS OLD.
YOU1000000166_S0000039	BY STAR WARS STANDARDS, THAT WOULD MAKE BABY YODA PART OF THE SILENT GENERATION. AND BY THAT I MEAN THE ONE THAT CAME BEFORE THE BABY BOOMERS, WHICH, OF COURSE IN STAR WARS, WERE ALL THE BABIES THAT WERE BORN RIGHT AFTER ALDERAAN WENT...
YOU1000000166_S0000040	BOOM! OKAY, BOOMERS. THERE'S ONE LESS PLANET IN THE GALAXY.
YOU1000000166_S0000041	AND LISTEN, THIS TOPIC HITS REALLY CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME BECAUSE I CURRENTLY OWN A TODDLER.
YOU1000000166_S0000042	YOU'LL HEAR PARENTS SAYING STUFF LIKE, I WISH THEY COULD STAY LITTLE FOREVER, BUT HALF A CENTURY OF DIAPER CHANGES IS SOMETHING NO ONE IS SIGNING UP FOR.
YOU1000000166_S0000043	BUT ALL THOSE DIAPERS AND MEMES GOT ME THINKING, 50 YEARS IS A REALLY LONG TIME TO BE A BABY. A RELATIVELY HELPLESS BABY.
YOU1000000166_S0000044	AND I'M SAYING THAT AS A HUMAN, THE SPECIES WITH THE LONGEST ADOLESCENCE ON THE PLANET. SO HOW DOES THIS INSANELY LONG CHILDHOOD HAPPEN?
YOU1000000166_S0000045	AND IS THERE ANY WAY THAT 50 YEARS OF TUMMY TIME COULD BE REMOTELY PLAUSIBLE SCIENTIFICALLY? WELL, I STARTED RESEARCHING AS I DO IT.
YOU1000000166_S0000046	AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST SCIENTIFIC PRECEDENT, BUT AN EXPLANATION HERE FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ENTIRE YODA SPECIES.
YOU1000000166_S0000047	THAT'S RIGHT, UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF BABY YODA ISN'T JUST A FUN FACT FROM THE MANDALORIAN OR ME OVERTHINKING A SCI FI FRANCHISE.
YOU1000000166_S0000048	BUT IT'S THE SINGLE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE MOST BELOVED CHARACTER IN STAR WARS HISTORY.
YOU1000000166_S0000049	AND WHY HE, YODA, BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE MAIN SERIES OF MOVIES, IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY ONE OF HIS SPECIES LEFT.
YOU1000000166_S0000050	I GOTTA SAY, BETWEEN THIS THEORY AND THE LAST ONE I DID OVER ON GAME THEORY ABOUT STAR WARS' FORCE BEING PRETTY MUCH SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE, WHICH IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED IT,
YOU1000000166_S0000051	YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD AFTER THIS EPISODE. I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT GEORGE LUCAS MIGHT SECRETLY BE A SCIENTIFIC GENIUS. ALMOST. LET'S NOT GIVE HIM TOO MUCH CREDIT.
YOU1000000166_S0000052	SO JOIN ME AS I TAKE A LOOK INTO THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY OF BABY YODA AND FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHY THEY'RE SO COOL AND ALSO WHY THEY'RE PRACTICALLY EXTINCT.
YOU1000000166_S0000053	BEFORE WE OPEN YOUR BIOLOGY TEXTBOOKS TO CHAPTER 5, WE NEED TO CLEAR THE AIR ON ONE THING. NO, I DON'T KNOW THE ACTUAL NAME OF THE SPECIES YODA COMES FROM.
YOU1000000166_S0000054	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M IN GOOD COMPANY BECAUSE GEORGE LUCAS DIDN'T EITHER. GEORGE LUCAS SPECIFICALLY DIDN'T WANT YODA'S SPECIES TO HAVE A NAME.
YOU1000000166_S0000055	AND RARELY SANCTIONED WORK THAT REVEALED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR LORE. SO EVEN THOUGH THE YODA SPECIES EXISTED IN PLACES LIKE KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC THE VIDEO GAME, INFORMATION ABOUT THEM DOESN'T APPEAR IN ANYTHING
YOU1000000166_S0000056	THAT'S OFFICIALLY CANON ANYMORE. SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING THIS ENTIRE EPISODE SAYING THE WORD YODA AND HAVING TO CLARIFY BETWEEN WHETHER I'M TALKING ABOUT YODA THE SPECIES OR YODA THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THAT SPECIES,
YOU1000000166_S0000057	I'LL INSTEAD BE REFERRING TO THE YODA SPECIES AS THE TRIDACTYLS.
YOU1000000166_S0000058	BECAUSE THEIR EXTREMITIES HAVE THREE DIGITS, RIGHT? BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT'S REALLY JUST A FAN MADE DESIGNATION FOR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE YODA SPECIES THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY AWARE OF, WHICH ARE JUST THREE.
YOU1000000166_S0000059	HONESTLY, YOU GOT ORIGINAL YODA, YOU GOT YADDLE FROM THE PHANTOM MENACE WHO JUST APPEARS FOR A COUPLE SECONDS, AND BABY YODA, WHATEVER HIS NAME ENDS UP BEING, FROM THE MANDALORIAN.
YOU1000000166_S0000060	SO WITH THAT BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING OUT OF THE WAY AND WITH THE VERY SHORT LIST OF ACTUAL KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE YODA SPECIES, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TRIDACTYLS?
YOU1000000166_S0000061	WE KNOW THAT YODA LIVED TO THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 900 IN RETURN OF THE JEDI, WHICH EVERYONE ELSE IS SURPRISED ABOUT, BUT HE ISN'T, SEEMING TO INDICATE THAT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT BIG OF A DEAL FOR HIM.
YOU1000000166_S0000062	BABY YODA, WHO'S JUST STUCK WITH THAT NAME FOR THIS EPISODE, I GUESS, IS 50, BUT FUNCTIONALLY HE'S ABOUT A 10 MONTH OLD.
YOU1000000166_S0000063	IF MY KID IS ANY INDICATION. HE'S NONVERBAL, BUT HE IS CAPABLE OF WALKING AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE. SO WE KNOW
YOU1000000166_S0000064	AS A TRIDACTYL YOU GET 900 YEARS IN THE GALAXY ON THE HIGH END BUT AT LEAST THE
YOU1000000166_S0000066	THE FIRST 50 OF THEM ARE SPENT AS A BABY, WHICH I GUESS LEAVES LIKE A HUNDRED TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.
YOU1000000166_S0000067	ANOTHER 200 YEARS OF LIVING IN YOUR PARENTS' BASEMENT, BEFORE FINALLY GETTING YOUR OWN APARTMENT AT THE TENDER AGE OF 300.
YOU1000000166_S0000068	NOW, BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING IN OUTER SPACE AND IN A FICTIONAL FRANCHISE, IT'S WORTH DOUBLE CHECKING. WHEN THEY SAY THAT BABY YODA IS 50 YEARS OLD IN THE MANDALORIAN,
YOU1000000166_S0000069	DOES THAT TRANSLATE TO YEARS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM HERE ON EARTH? AND IT APPEARS LIKE IT DOES. ACCORDING TO WIKIPEDIA, THE REPUBLIC STANDARDIZED ITS TIME BASED ON CORUSCANT.
YOU1000000166_S0000070	WHICH, CONVENIENTLY, ROTATES ITS SUN EXACTLY ONCE EVERY 365 CORUSCANTIAN DAYS, WHICH ARE BROKEN DOWN THEMSELVES INTO 24 HOUR INCREMENTS.
YOU1000000166_S0000071	AND THEN, MINUTES THAT ARE INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO OUR OWN MINUTES. SO WHEN YODA SAYS THAT HE'S 900 YEARS OLD, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT WE THINK 900 YEARS IS.
YOU1000000166_S0000072	AND THE MANDALORIAN HAS EVERY REASON TO BE SURPRISED THAT HIS 50 YEAR OLD MARK WAS STILL A BABY.
YOU1000000166_S0000073	SO, KNOWING THAT, IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY. HAVING SUCH A LONG DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS MORE THAN JUST AN INTERESTING EVOLUTIONARY QUIRK,
YOU1000000166_S0000074	IT ACTUALLY TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW TRIDACTYLS MAY HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME. MOSTLY BECAUSE IT PARALLELS A LOT OF OUR OWN HUMAN EVOLUTION.
YOU1000000166_S0000075	YOU SEE, MOST ANIMALS EVOLVED TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME BETWEEN BIRTH AND REPRODUCTIVE MATURITY SO THAT THEY CAN GO ON AND GROW THEIR POPULATION AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
YOU1000000166_S0000076	BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL EVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT US HUMANS HAVE INCREDIBLY LONG AND PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE CHILDHOODS.
YOU1000000166_S0000077	WHEN A BABY GIRAFFE IS BORN, IT CAN STAND ALMOST... ALMOST... ALMOST... RIGHT AWAY. OH, THEY'RE SO CUTE! HUMANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, NOT SO MUCH.
YOU1000000166_S0000078	IT IS TAKING MONTHS, IF NOT A YEAR, FOR A BABY HUMAN TO ACTUALLY GET UP ON ITS FEET. SO WHY DO HUMANS, THE SMARTEST ANIMALS ON THE PLANET,
YOU1000000166_S0000079	COME OUT SO USELESS.
YOU1000000166_S0000080	WELL, TURNS OUT THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE COMES DOWN TO OUR BRAINS. YOU SEE, OUR BRAINY HEADS AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE SO FAT HAVE CHANGED OUR ENTIRE COURSE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION.
YOU1000000166_S0000081	OUR ANCESTORS, WHO MANY BELIEVE EMERGED FROM SUB SAHARAN AFRICA, WERE AMONG THE FIRST SPECIES OF ANIMALS TO STOP WALKING AROUND ON FOUR LEGS
YOU1000000166_S0000082	AND START WALKING UP ON TWO. OUR BRAINS WERE BIG ENOUGH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LOGIC OUT THE IDEA THAT IT TOOK LESS ENERGY TO WALK ON TWO LEGS.
YOU1000000166_S0000083	AND IT MINIMIZED OUR BALD SKIN'S EXPOSURE TO THE EXTREMELY HOT GROUND TEMPERATURES IN THOSE AFRICAN DESERTS.
YOU1000000166_S0000084	AS NEWLY BIPEDAL PEOPLE, OUR EVOLUTION STARTED FAVORING OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR SPECIES WHO COULD ALSO WALK UPRIGHT. GOOD FOR US, NATURAL SELECTION AT ITS FINEST.
YOU1000000166_S0000085	BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A PRICE TO PAY FOR INNOVATION. YOU SEE, AS WE EVOLVE TO BE MORE AND MORE CAPABLE OF WALKING
YOU1000000166_S0000086	AND RUNNING AROUND ON TWO LEGS, OUR BODIES EVOLVE TO FACILITATE THAT AND COMPENSATE FOR OUR CHANGED CENTER OF GRAVITY, PRIMARILY DOING THIS BY NARROWING OUR HIPS.
YOU1000000166_S0000087	THIS, IN TURN, HELPED US TO WALK UPRIGHT LIKE CHAMPS, BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAD A PROBLEM. THAT BIG FAT HEAD OF OURS WAS LITERALLY TOO BIG TO BE BORN.
YOU1000000166_S0000088	SURE, WE HAD OURSELVES A BIG BRAIN, BUT NOW THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR IT TO GO BECAUSE OUR HIPS WERE TOO NARROW TO ACCOMMODATE BIRTHING AHEAD THAT HUGE.
YOU1000000166_S0000089	SO, HUMAN EVOLUTION HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN. AS THE THEORY GOES, WE STARTED HAVING BABIES EARLIER IN THEIR GESTATIONAL PERIOD.
YOU1000000166_S0000090	EARLIER, AT A TIME WHEN THE BABY WAS STILL TINY AND SMUSHY AND HELPLESS, WHICH WOULD BE PRETTY DARN BAD FOR OUR SURVIVAL EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.
YOU1000000166_S0000091	THE HEADS WERE STILL SMALL ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE UP ON OUT OF THERE. STILL A VERY PAINFUL PROCESS, BUT NOW AT LEAST IT WAS DOABLE.
YOU1000000166_S0000092	AND THEN ONCE THE BABY WAS ON THE OTHER END, THERE WOULD BE WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE FOURTH TRIMESTER.
YOU1000000166_S0000093	AN EXTRA TRIMESTER OF DEVELOPMENT THAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE IN THE REAL WORLD, WHERE WE AS PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT HELPLESS NEWBORN,
YOU1000000166_S0000094	BECAUSE TECHNICALLY, IT STILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IN THE WOMB. IT JUST NEEDED TO BE, YOU KNOW, EVICTED FROM ITS HOME BEFORE IT WAS TOO BIG TO LEAVE ITS DOOR.
YOU1000000166_S0000095	NOW, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FRIENDLY YODA. WHAT FEATURES DO WE SEE? WELL, HE'S BIPEDAL, HE'S SMALL, WITH A DISPROPORTIONATELY HUGE HEAD FOR HIS HIGHLY EVOLVED BRAIN,
YOU1000000166_S0000096	HE'S GOT A SHORT, HIGHLY EFFICIENT BODY WITH DIMINUTIVE, NARROW FEATURES, INCLUDING HIS HIPS. EVEN LOOKING AT THE BASIC CHARACTER MODEL,
YOU1000000166_S0000097	YOU CAN SEE HOW IN ORDER TO PROCREATE, THE TRIDACTYLS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THEMSELVES RADICALLY DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS.
YOU1000000166_S0000098	YOU CAN ALSO SEE HOW HAVING A BIG BRAIN IS A HUGE EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE. HUMANS ARE SO FAR AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN THAT WE PROTECT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FOOD CHAIN.
YOU1000000166_S0000099	TRIDACTYLS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE ARE THE WISEST AND MOST POWERFUL FORCE USERS IN THE GALAXY.
YOU1000000166_S0000100	BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THEY, LIKE US, ARE ESSENTIALLY BORN TOO EARLY. HELPLESS FOR MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS, OR UNTIL AT LEAST THEIR DAD MAKES THEM PAY RENT.
YOU1000000166_S0000101	AND THEIR MOM STOPS DOING THEIR LAUNDRY. THIS THEORY CONTINUES TO HOLD WATER IF WE LOOK AT INFANCY FOR HUMANS VERSUS INFANCY FOR TRIDACTYLS. IN THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS,
YOU1000000166_S0000102	HUMAN BABY BRAINS GROW TO 75% OF THEIR FULL ADULT SIZE. WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE SAME FOR TRIDACTYLS,
YOU1000000166_S0000103	BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE PROPORTIONS OF HUMAN BABIES PARALLEL THE PROPORTIONS OF BABY YODA. ENORMOUS HEAD, ADORABLY TINY BODY.
YOU1000000166_S0000104	BESIDES MAKING BABIES HILARIOUSLY TOP HEAVY, THESE PROPORTIONS ALSO SERVE A FUNCTION. IN INFANCY,
YOU1000000166_S0000105	HUMAN BRAINS COMMAND UP TO 87% OF THE TOTAL ENERGY THAT THE BODY USES AT REST.
YOU1000000166_S0000106	MEANING THAT EVEN WHILE SLEEPING, THE BODY IS DIVERTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO GROWING THE BRAIN.
YOU1000000166_S0000107	BECAUSE OF THIS, THE REST OF THE BABY'S GROWTH LAGS BEHIND THE HEAD, WHERE THE BRAIN IS. THIS, ACCORDING TO THE EXPENSIVE TISSUE HYPOTHESIS.
YOU1000000166_S0000108	WE CAN SEE THAT BABY YODA IS AN EXTREME VERSION OF THIS PRINCIPLE WITH A WILDLY HUGE AND MERCHANDISABLE HEAD
YOU1000000166_S0000109	AND A TEENY TINY BODY, MAKING ME THINK THAT BABY YODA IS AN EXTREMELY EVOLVED VERSION OF WHAT THE HUMAN RACE COULD LOOK LIKE SOMEDAY.
YOU1000000166_S0000111	THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTIONARILY ELONGATING THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS CALLED NIAT D.
YOU1000000166_S0000112	AND AFTER HUMANS BENEFITED FROM IT, SURVIVING WHEN OUR RELATIVES DIDN'T, WELL, EVOLUTION DIDN'T STOP ITS ROLL.
YOU1000000166_S0000113	HUMANS ARE ACTUALLY STILL EXPERIENCING LONGER DEVELOPMENT PERIODS NOW THAN WE EVEN DID 10,000 YEARS AGO.
YOU1000000166_S0000114	THE SHAPE OF OUR FACES AND HEADS ARE CONTINUALLY BECOMING LESS LIKE OUR NEANDERTHAL COUSINS BY BECOMING FLATTER, LESS HAIRY, LESS OBLONG.
YOU1000000166_S0000115	AGAIN, WE SHARE A LOT OF THESE SAME FEATURES WITH YODA, WHO'S SMALL, FLAT FACED WITH AN ENORMOUS HEAD. BUT IF HUMAN EVOLUTION CONTINUES TO MAKE OUR CHILDHOODS LONGER AND LONGER,
YOU1000000166_S0000116	THE QUESTION OF COURSE BECOMES, WHERE DOES IT STOP? WELL, IT STOPS AT YODA.
YOU1000000166_S0000117	THE PROBLEM WITH A LONG CHILDHOOD IS THAT A LOT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE TINY AND HELPLESS.
YOU1000000166_S0000118	EVENTUALLY, THERE'S AN EVOLUTIONARY TIPPING POINT WHERE CHILDHOOD BECOMES SO LONG THAT IT ACTUALLY LEAVES THE SPECIES TOO VULNERABLE TO SURVIVE INTO ADULTHOOD.
YOU1000000166_S0000119	TRIDACTYLS COULD VERY WELL BE THE EXTREME END POINT OF A SPECIES LIKE OURS.
YOU1000000166_S0000120	AS THE MANDALORIAN CLEARLY SHOWS, BABY TRIDACTYLS, EVEN 50 YEAR OLD BABY TRIDACTYLS, AREN'T CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES.
YOU1000000166_S0000121	SURE, THEY HAVE IMPRESSIVE FORCE POWERS, BUT VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER THEM.
YOU1000000166_S0000123	HUMAN CHILDREN SIMILARLY ARE PRETTY DARN HELPLESS, AND IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE BABY PROOF THE HOUSE, AND MAKE UP ALL KINDS OF SAFETY RULES FOR KIDS.
YOU1000000166_S0000124	IMAGINE HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SORT OF STUFF FOR 50, OR EVEN 100 YEARS. IT BECOMES EXTREMELY HARD FOR THE SPECIES TO GET THEIR OFFSPRING TO A PLACE OF SELF SUFFICIENCY.
YOU1000000166_S0000125	AND THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. NATURAL DISASTERS, PLAGUES, DRONE ATTACKS FROM THE EMPIRE.
YOU1000000166_S0000126	ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA BE PRETTY DARN HARD TO AVOID, BUT THEY BECOME A LOT EASIER TO BOUNCE BACK FROM IF SUDDENLY YOUR SPECIES CAN REPOPULATE QUICKLY.
YOU1000000166_S0000127	BUT IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE TO REPRODUCE A SINGLE GENERATION?
YOU1000000166_S0000128	I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST BEGGING FOR THE NEXT DEATH STAR TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE ZAP, WHICH BRINGS US TO YODA!
YOU1000000166_S0000129	WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT HIS HISTORY, BUT WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO THEORIZE IS PRETTY DARN INCREDIBLE. HE'S PRACTICALLY THE LAST OF HIS SPECIES,
YOU1000000166_S0000130	BECAUSE OF THE EVOLUTIONARY DOUBLE EDGED SWORD THAT HE'S DEALING WITH. ON ONE HAND, HE'S ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY EVOLVED BEINGS IN THE GALAXY.
YOU1000000166_S0000131	BUT HE'S SO EVOLVED THAT HIS SPECIES CAN NO LONGER SURVIVE. THEY'RE COMPLETELY OBSCURE.
YOU1000000166_S0000132	IT'S INCREDIBLY TRAGIC, AND NO, WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE TRIDACTYLS WERE WIPED OUT, BUT THAT ELONGATED CHILDHOOD.
YOU1000000166_S0000133	THAT EXTENDED NEOTENY TO THE EXTREMES OF 50 PLUS YEARS OF CHILDHOOD, THAT IS CERTAINLY A MASSIVE CONTRIBUTOR
YOU1000000166_S0000134	AS TO WHY. SO INCREDIBLY, STAR WARS, THE SERIES OFTEN DERIDED AS BEING SPACE FANTASY
YOU1000000166_S0000135	AND NOT SCIENCE FICTION, TURNS OUT TO BE SCIENTIFICALLY PLAUSIBLE YET AGAIN, SO, GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU, LUCAS, I'M PRETTY STUNNED.
YOU1000000166_S0000136	NO, I'VE TRIED TO HELP YOU OUT WITH THIS AND THE WHOLE MIDICHLORIANS POWERING THE FORCE THING, BUT I GOTTA ADMIT, STILL HAVE SOME QUIBBLES TO LEVEL AT YOU ABOUT THE JEDI'S RECRUITMENT PRACTICES.
YOU1000000166_S0000137	THAT ONE WILL BE COMING UP PRETTY SOON. WE HAVE SOME BONES TO PICK ON THAT FRONT, OKAY FRIEND? IN THE MEANTIME, IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE REAL LIFE EQUIVALENT OF MIDICHLORIANS,
YOU1000000166_S0000138	AND HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY POWERING THE REAL LIFE FORCE IN YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE, CLICK THE VIDEO THAT YOU SEE ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000166_S0000139	THAT'LL TAKE YOU TO MY OTHER SCIENCE OF STAR WARS EPISODE OVER ON GAME THEORY, LOOKING AT MIDICHLORIAN'S MITOCHONDRIA.
YOU1000000166_S0000140	AND HOW WE'RE ALL JUST A LITTLE BIT JEDI. IN THE MEANTIME, REMEMBER, THAT'S JUST A THEORY. A FILM THEORY! AAAAAAND CUT.
YOU1000000167_S0000000	WINNIE THE POOH AND THE ROYAL BIRTHDAY INSPIRED BY A. A. MILNE AND E. H. SHEPARD WITH DECORATIONS BY MARK BURGESS
YOU1000000167_S0000002	READ BY JIM BROADBENT.
YOU1000000167_S0000004	YOU COULD TELL CHRISTOPHER ROBIN HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY FROM THE WAY HE CLASPED HIS KNEES TIGHTLY AND WRIGGLED HIS TOES.
YOU1000000167_S0000006	EVERYBODY GATHERED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM EXPECTANTLY.
YOU1000000167_S0000008	I'VE HEARD THAT HER MAJESTY... CHRISTOPHER ROBIN BEGAN. SQUEAKED PIGLET IN A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT.
YOU1000000167_S0000009	A ROYAL HIGHNESS?" HE WENT ON. "'QUITE SO, QUITE SO," AGREED RABBIT. "'THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND,' HE SAID QUICKLY, BEFORE ANYONE ELSE COULD INTERRUPT HIM.
YOU1000000167_S0000010	OH, THE QUEEN," SAID POOH BEAR, MUCH RELIEVED. THE OTHER PEOPLE YOU MENTIONED SOUNDED MUCH TOO TALL AND FEARSOME, BUT THE QUEEN IS QUITE DIFFERENT.
YOU1000000167_S0000011	POOH HAD ONCE SENT A LETTER, AND WAS TOLD TO STICK ON A SMALL PICTURE OF THE QUEEN. IT STUCK MORE TO HIS NOSE THAN TO THE LETTER,
YOU1000000167_S0000012	BUT IT TOLD THE POSTMAN THAT IT WAS MOST URGENT, AND THAT THE QUEEN SAYS IT MUST BE SENT, AND SO HE WAS SURE IT HAD BEEN.
YOU1000000167_S0000014	AS I WAS SAYING, SAID CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, PASSING POOH A HONEY SANDWICH, SO THAT HE MIGHT CONTINUE SPEAKING,
YOU1000000167_S0000015	HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IS CELEBRATING AN IMPORTANT BIRTHDAY, HER 90TH BIRTHDAY, AND WE SHOULD TOO CELEBRATE IT.
YOU1000000167_S0000016	THAT IS, BY GIVING HER A PRESENT.
YOU1000000167_S0000018	I HAD A PRESENT ONCE," SIGHED EOR, WISTFULLY.
YOU1000000167_S0000020	TWO, IN FACT, IF I MAY BOAST A LITTLE.
YOU1000000167_S0000022	ONE WAS RATHER SMALL AND DAMP, AND THE OTHER SOMEWHAT LARGER AND STICKY.
YOU1000000167_S0000024	BUT I DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN.
YOU1000000167_S0000026	THE PRESENT IS SOMETHING, AND TO HAVE TWO IS SOMETHING ELSE.
YOU1000000167_S0000028	BOTH POOH AND PIGLET BLUSHED SLIGHTLY. THEY HAD A MEMORY OF A WONDERFUL BALLOON AND A LARGE JAR OF THE BEST HONEY.
YOU1000000167_S0000029	THAT HAD BEGUN AS EXCEEDINGLY GOOD PRESENTS, AND THEN
YOU1000000167_S0000030	DUE TO VARIOUS MISHAPS, HAD BECOME RATHER DISAPPOINTING PRESENTS.
YOU1000000167_S0000031	BUT WHICH WERE PRESENTS NEVERTHELESS, AND, AS EOR HAD SAID, THAT WAS SOMETHING.
YOU1000000167_S0000033	THE QUESTION IS, SAID RABBIT IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DO QUEENS LIKE BEST?
YOU1000000167_S0000035	THE HONEY, I SHOULD THINK," SIGHED POOH, LOOKING AT THE SMALL STICKY CRUMB WHERE THE HONEY SANDWICHES HAD ONCE BEEN.
YOU1000000167_S0000037	I'VE HEARD," SAID CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, WHO KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT FARAWAY PLACES LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOREST AND LONDON,
YOU1000000167_S0000038	THAT THE QUEEN HAS A GRAND TEA EVERY DAY IN HER PALACE WITH BUTTERED TOAST AND CRUMPETS.
YOU1000000167_S0000039	SO I SHOULDN'T THINK WE'D NEED TO GIVE HER ANYTHING TO EAT. A PRESENT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TO TREASURE.
YOU1000000167_S0000041	I'VE NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK FINDING TREASURE, SIGHED POOH.
YOU1000000167_S0000043	BUT I DID ONCE FIND THE NORTH POLE. DO YOU SUPPOSE THE QUEEN MIGHT LIKE THAT?
YOU1000000167_S0000045	THE FRIENDS THOUGHT THIS AN EXCELLENT IDEA, BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT FINDING THE NORTH POLE ONCE WAS A VERY FINE THING.
YOU1000000167_S0000046	BUT THAT FINDING IT AGAIN WAS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT THING.
YOU1000000167_S0000048	SUDDENLY THE FOREST SEEMED TO BE FULL OF STICKS THAT COULD OR COULD NOT BE THE NORTH POLE.
YOU1000000167_S0000050	THIS WILL NEVER DO, ANNOUNCED RABBIT.
YOU1000000167_S0000052	DO, MUMBLED POOH. THAT BRINGS TO MIND A LITTLE HUM, WHICH I'D LIKE TO HUM.
YOU1000000167_S0000053	IF IT WAS FELT THAT A HUM WAS CALLED FOR AT SUCH A TIME OF THOUGHTFULNESS?" AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY HE BEGAN.
YOU1000000167_S0000055	THE QUEEN LIVED IN HER PALACE, AS QUEENS OFTEN DO.
YOU1000000167_S0000057	DOING ALL THOSE BUSY THINGS BUSY QUEENS DO.
YOU1000000167_S0000059	BUT THE QUEEN COULD NEVER KNOW, AS YOU AND I DO.
YOU1000000167_S0000061	THAT DOING NOTHING MUCH CAN BE THE BEST THING TO DO?
YOU1000000167_S0000063	TO FROM A FOREST FAR AWAY FOR YOUR SPECIAL DAY.
YOU1000000167_S0000065	WE'RE SENDING YOU SOME QUIET AND A LITTLE TIME TO PLAY.
YOU1000000167_S0000067	AND QUIET THERE WAS.
YOU1000000167_S0000069	THE SORT OF QUIET THAT MAKES THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE TURN A SUNSET SHADE OF PINK.
YOU1000000167_S0000071	BAA
YOU1000000167_S0000073	ANNOUNCED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN SOLEMNLY.
YOU1000000167_S0000075	THAT HUM IS FIT FOR A QUEEN. THAT HUM SHALL BE THE QUEEN'S PRESENT. AL SHALL WRITE IT OUT, AND YOU AND I
YOU1000000167_S0000076	AND EEYORE WILL DELIVER IT TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE. AND PIGLET MUST COME TOO, BECAUSE LONDON IS A VERY BIG PLACE INDEED,
YOU1000000167_S0000077	AND EVEN SMALL ANIMALS, IF THEY ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS, CAN MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT.
YOU1000000167_S0000079	AND SO IT WAS DECIDED, AND OWL WAS CALLED FOR. OWL FUSSED HERE AND FUSSED THERE,
YOU1000000167_S0000081	AND USED UP A GOOD DEAL OF TIME, PAPER AND INK, BUT AT LAST IT WAS DONE AND EVERYONE ADMIRED IT.
YOU1000000167_S0000082	KANGA, WHO KNEW HOW IMPORTANT PRESENTATION WAS, ESPECIALLY FOR QUEENS, TOOK THE HUM, ROLLED IT,
YOU1000000167_S0000083	AND TIED A THICK VINE ROUND IT. INTO THE VINE SHE TWISTED WILD HEATHER, COLUMBINE, BUTTERCUPS, MEADOW SWEET, THYME.
YOU1000000167_S0000084	AND LASTLY, A THISTLE, KINDLY DONATED BY EEYORE.
YOU1000000167_S0000086	CHRISTOPHER ROBIN ALSO FOUND A BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT RED BALLOON, WHICH HE THOUGHT THE QUEEN MIGHT ENJOY ON GREY DAYS.
YOU1000000167_S0000087	PIGLET, YOU SHOULD HOLD IT," HE SAID. THAT WAY WE WON'T LOSE YOU IN THE CROWD.
YOU1000000167_S0000089	PIGLET HELD ON VERY TIGHTLY TO THE BALLOON. HE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT A CROWD WAS. SOMETHING LIKE A DARK CLOUD, PERHAPS,
YOU1000000167_S0000090	BUT IN ANY CASE, HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET LOST IN IT AND WAS PLEASED THE BALLOON WOULD HELP.
YOU1000000167_S0000092	SO THE PRESENTS WERE READY, AND SIDE BY SIDE WINNIE THE POOH, EDWARD BEAR, BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN, BRAVE ADVENTURER,
YOU1000000167_S0000093	AND LOYAL FRIEND. HIS SMALL COMPANION, PIGLET, EEYORE AND CHRISTOPHER ROBIN SET OFF FOR LONDON.
YOU1000000167_S0000095	OF COURSE, LONDON IS ON QUITE THE OTHER SIDE," REMARKED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN AS THEY WERE WALKING.
YOU1000000167_S0000097	OF THE SEA? ASKED POOH, SOMEWHAT ALARMED.
YOU1000000167_S0000099	"'NOT THE SEA, I SHOULDN'T THINK,' REPLIED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, WHOSE GEOGRAPHY LESSONS SO FAR HAD BEEN MOSTLY SPENT COLOURING IN EDGY BITS.
YOU1000000167_S0000100	BUT CERTAINLY THE COUNTRY OR COUNTY, I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHICH, IN ANY CASE IT IS VERY FAR OFF WHEN WE SHALL HAVE TO CATCH A TRAIN.
YOU1000000167_S0000102	I DO HOPE IT WANTS TO BE CAUGHT, SAID POO, WHO WAS ALREADY A LITTLE OUT OF PUFF FROM THE WALK. BUT THE TRAIN WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO STOP FOR THEM IN THE STATION.
YOU1000000167_S0000103	SO THERE WAS NO CATCHING TO BE DONE AT ALL, AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME TO CLIMB ABOARD AND FIND FOUR COMFY SEATS.
YOU1000000167_S0000104	AND THEN THEY WERE OFF.
YOU1000000167_S0000106	WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO STAY VERY CLOSE BY?" ASKED AN ANXIOUS PIGLET AS THEY GOT OFF THE TRAIN AT VICTORIA STATION.
YOU1000000167_S0000107	HE HADN'T EXPECTED LONDON TO HAVE QUITE SO MANY LEGS.
YOU1000000167_S0000109	THERE WERE PIN STRIPED LEGS, BIG BOOTED LEGS, AND SOME LEGS BALANCED ON POINTY SHOES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE A LITTLE STICK STUCK TO THE BOTTOM OF EACH SOLE.
YOU1000000167_S0000111	AND THEY WERE ALL IN A TERRIBLE RUSH, AND SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING.
YOU1000000167_S0000113	CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, POOH, PIGLET AND EEYORE LAUNCHED THEMSELVES INTO THIS VAST FOREST OF LEGS AND HOPED THEY'D COME OUT ALL RIGHT.
YOU1000000167_S0000115	THEY EMERGED INTO A BUSY STREET.
YOU1000000167_S0000117	CHRISTOPHER ROBIN TOLD THEM THAT THE LARGE BLACK VEHICLES RUSHING PAST WERE CALLED TRAFFIC.
YOU1000000167_S0000119	WHO THOUGHT THAT TRAFFIC LOOKED LIKE GIANT SHINY BEETLES? AND THINKING OF THEM AS BEETLES MADE IT LESS WORRYING.
YOU1000000167_S0000121	THE FRIENDS WALKED AND THEY WALKED.
YOU1000000167_S0000122	BUT EEYORE'S SIZE, THAT HAD STARTED OUT AS SMALL PUFFS, WERE NOW GROWING SO LARGE AND LOUD
YOU1000000167_S0000123	THAT THEY WERE WORRIED HE WOULD RUN OUT OF PUFF ALTOGETHER. AND WINNIE THE POOH'S LEGS WERE KNOWN FOR THEIR STOUTNESS, NOT THEIR BRISK WALKING.
YOU1000000167_S0000124	AND PIGLETS' LEGS WERE SO SHORT THAT THEY WERE HARDLY WORTH SPEAKING OF AT ALL.
YOU1000000167_S0000126	SO CHRISTOPHER ROBIN SUGGESTED THEY RIDE ON A BUS THE REST OF THE WAY TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
YOU1000000167_S0000128	MOST CONSIDERATE, I'M SURE," SIGHED EOR.
YOU1000000167_S0000130	ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY LESS PUFFILY THIS TIME.
YOU1000000167_S0000132	THE FRIENDS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A BUS BEFORE, AND THIS WAS A MOST UNUSUAL ONE. IT HAD WINDING STAIRS.
YOU1000000167_S0000133	AND UP AT THE TOP THERE WAS NO ROOF AT ALL.
YOU1000000167_S0000135	AS THE BUS BEGAN TO MOVE, THE WIND DID ITS BEST TO BLOW PIGLET'S EARS RIGHT OFF, AND HE NEARLY LOST HOLD OF THE BALLOON.
YOU1000000167_S0000136	WE'LL CALL THIS THE BLUSTERY BUS!" LAUGHED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN.
YOU1000000167_S0000138	THE BUS TOOK THE FRIENDS PAST A GREAT MANY IMPORTANT BUILDINGS.
YOU1000000167_S0000140	AND CHRISTOPHER ROBIN DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE NAMES.
YOU1000000167_S0000142	THERE WAS ONE VERY GRAND OLD SHOP WHICH POOH FOUND STRANGELY FAMILIAR, BUT HE TOLD HIMSELF HE WAS BEING SILLY.
YOU1000000167_S0000143	AS THIS WAS SURELY HIS FIRST VISIT TO LONDON.
YOU1000000167_S0000145	AT THE NEXT STOP, THEY WERE ABLE TO GET OUT AND STRETCH THEIR LEGS A LITTLE.
YOU1000000167_S0000147	THIS IS TRAFALGAR SQUARE, SAID THE DRIVER. LOOK OUT FOR THE LIONS.
YOU1000000167_S0000149	LIONS? GASPED PIGLET IN SOME ALARM. AND THERE WERE INDEED LIONS.
YOU1000000167_S0000150	BUT THANKFULLY NOT THE FURRY ONES WITH HOT BREATH AND HUNGRY EYES THAT THEY WERE IMAGINING.
YOU1000000167_S0000152	THESE LIONS WERE COLD AND MAJESTIC, AND THEIR BACKS WERE SHINY FROM WHERE MANY PEOPLE HAD SAT UPON THEM.
YOU1000000167_S0000156	OH, HOW I'D LOVE TO HAVE A LION!" CHRISTOPHER ROBIN SIGHED.
YOU1000000167_S0000158	BUT POOH THOUGHT THAT BEARS WERE BEST AND PULLED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN BACK TO THE BUS.
YOU1000000167_S0000160	THE TOUR THEN TOOK THEM PAST AN ENORMOUS CLOCK IN A HIGH UP TOWER. CHRISTOPHER ROBIN TOLD THEM THAT THIS CLOCK'S LARGEST BELL WAS CALLED BIG BEN.
YOU1000000167_S0000162	I FEEL SURE," SAID POOH, THAT WITH THIS CLOCK I COULD REALLY LEARN TO TELL THE TIME. WITH SMALLER CLOCKS I DO TRY TO TELL IT, BUT IT JUST DOESN'T LISTEN.
YOU1000000167_S0000163	THE NUMBERS JUMP ABOUT SO, AND THE LITTLE HAND CHASES THE BIG HAND JUST TO TEASE IT. AND O'CLOCK ISN'T AN O AT ALL.
YOU1000000167_S0000164	AND SECONDS AREN'T A LITTLE SOMETHING MORE TO EAT AND EVERYTHING GETS SO TERRIBLY MUDDLED.
YOU1000000167_S0000166	A CLOCK LIKE THIS, THOUGH, IS SURE TO BEHAVE ITSELF.
YOU1000000167_S0000168	BUT THE FRIENDS COULDN'T STAY TO LEARN TO TELL THE TIME BECAUSE THE NEXT STOP FOR THE BUS WAS BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
YOU1000000167_S0000170	OH, POOH, WHISPERED PIGLET AS THEY CLIMBED OFF THE BUS. ISN'T IT GRAND?
YOU1000000167_S0000172	AND IT CERTAINLY WAS. BEHIND GOLDEN GATES, WINDOWS ROSE UP IN EVERY DIRECTION, ROWS AND ROWS OF WINDOWS,
YOU1000000167_S0000173	AND ABOVE IT ALL, THE ROYAL STANDARD FLAG WAVED PROUDLY IN THE SKY.
YOU1000000167_S0000175	THE FLAG MEANS THAT THE QUEEN IS AT HOME, ANNOUNCED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, WHO KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT QUEENS AND SUCHLIKE, BECAUSE HE HAD COME TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE ONCE BEFORE, MANY YEARS AGO.
YOU1000000167_S0000177	WELL, IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR SOME, COMPLAINED EOR. I'VE NEVER HAD A FLAG MYSELF.
YOU1000000167_S0000179	BUT THEN I'M ALWAYS AT HOME. ONE BOGGY PLACE IS MUCH LIKE ANOTHER, AND I DON'T HOLD WITH ALL THIS PACKING UP.
YOU1000000167_S0000180	AND FAREWELL AND SEE YOU SOON, PALLAVA.
YOU1000000167_S0000182	AT THAT MOMENT A BUGLE SOUNDED. PIGLET GAVE A STARTLED JUMP AND THEN CONTINUED JUMPING IN TIME WITH THE MARCHING BAND.
YOU1000000167_S0000183	TO SHOW THAT IT HADN'T BEEN A STARTLED JUMP AT ALL.
YOU1000000167_S0000185	THE QUEEN'S GUARD MARCHED PAST. THEY WERE SPLENDID IN THEIR BRIGHT RED UNIFORMS, SHINY BUTTONS AND TALL FURRY HATS.
YOU1000000167_S0000187	WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY KEEP UNDER THEIR HATS, POOH?" ASKED BIGLET, A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH AFTER ALL HIS JUMPING.
YOU1000000167_S0000189	PERHAPS A LITTLE SOMETHING TO NIBBLE ON. JUST A SMACKEREL OF SOMETHING. STICKY PERHAPS.
YOU1000000167_S0000191	SWEET, CERTAINLY.
YOU1000000167_S0000193	WHOSE VOICE FADED OFF INTO A HAPPY DREAM.
YOU1000000167_S0000195	BUT ALL AT ONCE, THERE WAS A STIRRING IN THE CROWD, AND THE MURMUR ROSE UP, IT'S THE QUEEN! THE QUEEN IS COMING!
YOU1000000167_S0000197	POOH AND PIGLET SQUEEZE THEIR WAY TO THE FRONT OF THE CROWD.
YOU1000000167_S0000199	AND THEN THEY SAW A SIGHT THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS SECRETLY HOPED FOR, BUT HAD NEVER DARED IMAGINE MIGHT REALLY HAPPEN.
YOU1000000167_S0000201	THE QUEEN HERSELF WAS OUT FOR A STROLL AND SHE WAS GREETING THE CROWD AS SHE WENT.
YOU1000000167_S0000203	SHE WAS JUST AS QUEENLY AND SMILEY AND WONDERFUL AS THEY HAD EXPECTED HER TO BE.
YOU1000000167_S0000205	THE QUEEN WAS SO CLOSE THAT THEY COULD HAVE REACHED OUT AND TOUCHED HER FINE COAT.
YOU1000000167_S0000207	WINNIE THE POOH KNEW THAT IT WAS NOW OR NEVER.
YOU1000000167_S0000209	BOLDLY HE STEPPED FORWARD
YOU1000000167_S0000211	AND RECITED HIS HUM IN THE LOUDEST, BRAVEST VOICE HE COULD MANAGE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
YOU1000000167_S0000213	THE QUEEN SMILED WARMLY AT THEM ALL.
YOU1000000167_S0000215	BEHIND THE QUEEN RAN A LITTLE BOY. HE WAS MUCH YOUNGER THAN CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, AND ALMOST AS BOUNCY AS TIGGER. HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF PIGLET AND THE BALLOON.
YOU1000000167_S0000216	AND HE JUMPED UP AND DOWN IN DELIGHT.
YOU1000000167_S0000218	THE LITTLE BOY PATTED PIGLET FONDLY AND TICKLED WINNIE THE POOH'S EARS.
YOU1000000167_S0000220	PIGLET HANDED HIM THE BEAUTIFUL BALLOON, AND HE GIGGLED AND SKIPPED AWAY WITH IT.
YOU1000000167_S0000222	WHERE'S EEYORE?" ASKED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN ANXIOUSLY AS THE QUEEN WALKED ON TO GREET OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CROWD.
YOU1000000167_S0000224	WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT, THEY HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM.
YOU1000000167_S0000226	AND THEN THEY SAW HIM, WITH HIS BACK TO THEM, STARING UP AT THE PALACE.
YOU1000000167_S0000228	I BELIEVE I SAW THE QUEEN AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS," HE ANNOUNCED PROUDLY.
YOU1000000167_S0000229	WE MUST BE HEADING HOME NOW," INTERRUPTED CHRISTOPHER ROBIN, WHO COULDN'T BEAR TO DISAPPOINT DEAR OLD EEYORE, WHO HAD MISSED THE WHOLE THING.
YOU1000000167_S0000231	LATER, WHEN THE STORY HAD BEEN RETOLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WINNIE THE POOH WAS SURE THAT THE QUEEN HAD SAID, OH, CHARMY!
YOU1000000167_S0000232	BUT WHAT WAS CERTAIN WAS THAT THE HUM HAD BEEN SHARED, AND THE QUEEN HAD GONE.
YOU1000000167_S0000234	SHE WAS BACK BEHIND THE TALL GOLDEN GATES OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE, WHERE NO BEAR COULD GO.
YOU1000000167_S0000237	DO YOU THINK THE QUEEN LIKED MY HUM, CHRISTOPHER ROBIN?" ASKED POOH AS THEY WALKED DOWN THE MALL.
YOU1000000167_S0000239	SILLY OLD BEAR, I'M SURE OF IT, HE REPLIED, SQUEEZING HIS PAW A LITTLE TIGHTER.
YOU1000000167_S0000241	IT MUST BE A VERY GREAT THING TO BE NINETY YEARS OLD, MUSED POOH.
YOU1000000167_S0000243	PLEASED TO BE ON HIS WAY BACK HOME, WHERE A LITTLE SMACKEREL OF SOMETHING WAS SURE TO BE AWAITING THEM.
YOU1000000167_S0000245	WHAT THE FRIENDS DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU1000000167_S0000247	THAT POOH BEAR HAD ARRIVED IN THE FOREST IN THE VERY SAME YEAR THAT PRINCESS ELIZABETH WAS BORN.
YOU1000000167_S0000249	BUT TIME IS A TRICKY THING. YEARS BEGIN BY LAZING ALONG SLOWLY, AND THEN SUDDENLY UP THEY JUMP AND OFF THEY TROT AS QUICKLY AS EVER THEY CAN.
YOU1000000167_S0000251	TO WINNIE THE POOH IT FELT LIKE JUST YESTERDAY THAT HE HAD COME BUMPING DOWN THOSE STAIRS. BUMP, BUMP, BUMP.
YOU1000000167_S0000253	AND THAT IS JUST THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
YOU1000000168_S0000001	CUTEST EXOTIC ANIMALS YOU CAN ACTUALLY OWN. DO YOU WANT TO BE ANOTHER BORING PET OWNER? OR ARE YOU LOOKING TO TURN A FEW HEADS ON YOUR NEXT MORNING STROLL
YOU1000000168_S0000002	WITH YOUR NEWEST ANIMAL COMPANION. WELL, YOU COULD BRAVE THE MISSION AND OPT FOR A BENGAL TIGER LIKE MIKE TYSON, BUT A FULL GROWN WILDCAT IS QUITE A PIECE OF WORK.
YOU1000000168_S0000003	AND NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD IN MIND FOR TODAY'S LIST. WE WERE THINKING A LITTLE MORE CUTE AND EXOTIC. LIKE THE PLAYFUL CHINCHILLA.
YOU1000000168_S0000004	OR THE FLUFFY FENNEC FOX, PERHAPS EVEN A GOOFY CRESTED GECKO OR A DOG SIZED RODENT LIKE THE AUSTRALIAN CAPYBARA.
YOU1000000168_S0000005	WITH A LITTLE EXTRA RESEARCH AND WORK, THESE BIZARRE AND ADORABLE ANIMALS COULD REALISTICALLY BECOME YOUR NEXT PET. SO, IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO TURN A FEW HEADS,
YOU1000000168_S0000006	AND MELT A FEW HEARTS WITH YOUR NEWEST, UNUSUAL ANIMAL FRIEND? STAY TUNED AS WE COUNT DOWN OUR TOP 10 PICKS FOR THE CUTEST EXOTIC ANIMALS YOU CAN ACTUALLY OWN.
YOU1000000168_S0000007	OH, AND IF YOU THOUGHT CRABS COULDN'T BE SWEET, THEN STAY TUNED FOR NUMBER 1.
YOU1000000168_S0000008	BECAUSE THIS UNIQUE AND EXOTIC CRITTER IS SURE TO MAKE YOUR AQUARIUM A LOT CUTER. OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED.
YOU1000000168_S0000009	10. THE CAPYBARA ON FIRST SIGHT, YOU MAY CONFUSE THIS LARGE CUTENESS FOR ONE BIG GUINEA PIG, AND YOU'D ACTUALLY BE RIGHT.
YOU1000000168_S0000010	THE SOUTH AMERICAN CAPYBARA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST RODENTS IN THE WORLD. IT CAN WEIGH UP TO 140 POUNDS. NOT TO WORRY.
YOU1000000168_S0000011	YOU WON'T BE NEEDING A HUGE CAGE, BECAUSE CAPYBARAS ARE SEMI AQUATIC RODENTS. SO, SCRATCH THE DOG SIZED HAMSTER WHEEL OFF YOUR LIST.
YOU1000000168_S0000012	BECAUSE THIS ANIMAL DEFINITELY NEEDS ACCESS TO A BODY OF WATER IN ORDER TO SWIM AROUND LIKE YOUR POOL
YOU1000000168_S0000014	ALTHOUGH MOSTLY ADORABLE AND SWEET, CAPYBARAS CAN BE A CHALLENGING PET, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE EXTREMELY SOCIAL ANIMALS.
YOU1000000168_S0000015	SO, IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON OWNING ONE, IT'S BEST TO MAKE ROOM FOR A COUPLE MORE. THIS RODENT IS LEGAL TO OWN IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD.
YOU1000000168_S0000016	ALTHOUGH SOME COUNTRIES AND STATES MAY REQUIRE A SEPARATE LICENSE. BUT THOSE CUTE AND FURRY SNOUTS ARE WELL WORTH THE EXTRA PAPERWORK.
YOU1000000168_S0000017	9. THE SERVAL NOW, WE CAN'T ALL ADOPT A ROYAL BENGAL TIGER AS MIKE TYSON ONCE DID.
YOU1000000168_S0000018	BUT MOST CAT LOVERS WOULD SURELY LOVE TO SETTLE FOR THIS WILD BEAUTY. SERVALS CAN EVEN BE LITTER TRAINED IF YOU START EARLY ENOUGH.
YOU1000000168_S0000020	THESE MEDIUM SIZED AFRICAN CATS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO WARM CLIMATES AND WIDE OPEN SPACES.
YOU1000000168_S0000021	FOR YOU PET OWNERS, IT MEANS YOU'LL NEED A MODERATE AMOUNT OF SPACE FOR YOUR EXOTIC CAT TO FEEL AT HOME.
YOU1000000168_S0000023	SERVALS REQUIRE LOTS OF DAILY EXERCISE AND LOVE TO PLAY, SO A SPACIOUS GARDEN IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET.
YOU1000000168_S0000025	8. THE FENNEC FOX AS IF FOXES WEREN'T CUTE ENOUGH, WE GIVE YOU THE FENNEC FOX.
YOU1000000168_S0000026	HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE EARS, THEY ARE PHENOMENAL.
YOU1000000168_S0000027	THESE FOXES COME FROM THE AFRICAN CONTINENT AND ARE THE SMALLEST BREED OF FOX IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000168_S0000029	ONLY REACHING ABOUT 4 POUNDS WHEN FULLY GROWN. BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID ABOUT THE SIZE OF THOSE ADORABLE EARS.
YOU1000000168_S0000030	IF YOU NEVER QUITE FIGURED OUT WHETHER YOU'RE A CAT OR A DOG PERSON, THE FENNEC FOX MAY BECOME YOUR FAVORITE FOUR LEGGED COMPANION.
YOU1000000168_S0000031	TIM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU1000000168_S0000033	BOOP!
YOU1000000168_S0000035	THIS FOX'S BEHAVIOR CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS A CROSSWAY BETWEEN THAT OF A DOG AND A CAT.
YOU1000000168_S0000037	THEY'RE USUALLY PLAYFUL AND ENERGETIC, LIKE A DOG, BUT JUST AS EQUALLY INDEPENDENT, LIKE A CAT. SO YOU'LL BE FINE LEAVING THEM HOME ALONE FOR A FEW HOURS.
YOU1000000168_S0000039	WHAT SETS THEM APART THOUGH IS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY FAVOR DOG NOR CAT TOYS. THIS EXOTIC ANIMAL CAN LIVE UP TO 15 YEARS
YOU1000000168_S0000040	AND IS LEGAL TO OWN IN MOST OF AMERICA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW STATES. BUT HEY, IF YOU'RE DYING TO OWN ONE, YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST MOVE TO ANOTHER STATE.
YOU1000000168_S0000042	OH MY GOD.
YOU1000000168_S0000044	7. BOX TURTLES
YOU1000000168_S0000046	ALTHOUGH THEY CAN BE TRICKY TO CARE FOR, BOX TURTLES MAKE SOME CUTE AND SERIOUSLY LONG TERM REPTILIAN COMPANIONS. LIKE MOST TURTLES.
YOU1000000168_S0000048	THEY CARRY THEIR HOMES ON THEIR BACKS, AND THIS SPECIES CAN LIVE FOR UP TO 50 YEARS.
YOU1000000168_S0000050	WHICH MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT FOR A HOUSEHOLD PET, BUT IS LAUGHABLE WHEN COMPARED TO JONATHAN, THE WORLD'S OLDEST TURTLE AT 189 YEARS OLD.
YOU1000000168_S0000052	BOX TURTLES LIKE TO SOAK IN WATER FROM TIME TO TIME TO REHYDRATE AND COOL DOWN.
YOU1000000168_S0000054	BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE THEM PRO SWIMMERS. IN FACT, THEY'RE ACTUALLY LAND TURTLES.
YOU1000000168_S0000056	AND LOOK PRETTY CLUMSY WHILE DOING IT. SO, DESPITE THEIR SHARP BEAKS, ROUGH, SCALY SKIN, AND TINY POINTED CLAWS,
YOU1000000168_S0000057	A BOX TURTLE CAN MAKE A PRETTY DARN CUTE ADDITION TO YOUR TERRARIUM.
YOU1000000168_S0000059	6. THE CHINCHILLA FROM HAMSTERS TO GERBILS, RODENTS HAVE A REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE CUTEST HOUSEHOLD PETS.
YOU1000000168_S0000060	BUT, ON THE MORE EXOTIC END OF THE SPECTRUM, AND PERHAPS 10 TIMES MORE ADORABLE, IS THE CHINCHILLA.
YOU1000000168_S0000062	THE SOUTH AMERICAN CHINCHILLA CAN BOND VERY CLOSELY WITH ITS CARETAKER.
YOU1000000168_S0000064	BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, IS ONE OF THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE RODENTS.
YOU1000000168_S0000066	THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY'RE DANGEROUS OR ANYTHING, THEY JUST DON'T LIKE TO BE CUDDLED.
YOU1000000168_S0000067	OW, OW, OW, YOU BIT ME HARD.
YOU1000000168_S0000068	AT LEAST NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS THEY LOVE TO RUN AROUND AND PLAY. THEY'RE QUITE ACTIVE AND GET BORED PRETTY EASILY.
YOU1000000168_S0000070	SO YOU'LL NEED MORE THAN A PLAIN OLD HAMSTER WHEEL TO KEEP THESE LITTLE GUYS BUSY.
YOU1000000168_S0000072	BUT WE'RE SURE YOU'LL AGREE, THOSE GIGANTIC EARS AND THAT FLUFFY TAIL ARE WELL WORTH THE EXTRA EFFORT.
YOU1000000168_S0000074	5. THE SUGAR GLIDER
YOU1000000168_S0000076	IF YOU'VE EVER WONDERED WHAT IT'S LIKE TO OWN A FLYING SQUIRREL,
YOU1000000168_S0000078	THEN YOU SHOULD PURCHASE A SUGAR GLIDER. WHILE SQUIRRELS CAN'T BE DOMESTICATED, SUGAR GLIDERS ARE THE NEXT BEST THING AND, MANY WOULD AGREE, A LOT CUTER.
YOU1000000168_S0000080	JUST LOOK AT THOSE EYES!
YOU1000000168_S0000082	ALTHOUGH THE TWO LOOK SIMILAR, SUGAR GLIDERS ARE ACTUALLY PART OF THE MARSUPIAL FAMILY. JUST LIKE KANGAROOS.
YOU1000000168_S0000084	THE FEMALE'S GLIDER DOUBLES AS A POUCH, WHERE THEY RAISE THEIR YOUNG, UNTIL THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH TO FLY OFF.
YOU1000000168_S0000086	I MEAN, GLIDOFF ON THEIR OWN.
YOU1000000168_S0000088	IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE THEY GOT THE NAME, IT'S BECAUSE THEY LOVE TO EAT ALMOST ANYTHING THAT IS SWEET, ESPECIALLY FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.
YOU1000000168_S0000090	THE BEST PART ABOUT THESE AUSTRALIAN NATIVES IS THAT THEY LOVE PLAYDATES WITH THEIR CAREGIVERS AND GET ALONG GREAT WITH OTHER ANIMALS.
YOU1000000168_S0000092	4. THE KINKAJOU
YOU1000000168_S0000094	KINKAJOUS ARE SMALL, GOLDEN BROWN HONEY BEARS THAT ARE NATIVE TO RAINFORESTS AND HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AS PETS.
YOU1000000168_S0000095	CELEBRITIES, SUCH AS PARIS HILTON, IS KNOWN TO OWN A KINKAJOU AND A SUGAR GLIDER. BUT THE RICH AND FAMOUS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO FIND THESE ANIMALS ADORABLE.
YOU1000000168_S0000096	NO, NO, DON'T EAT THAT! NO!
YOU1000000168_S0000098	TAKE IT, JUST GRAB IT.
YOU1000000168_S0000099	MAKING THE DECISION TO CARE FOR A KINKAJOU ISN'T TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY, THOUGH, AS THESE NOCTURNAL ANIMALS LIKE TO GET INTO THINGS AND CAN BE PRETTY MESSY.
YOU1000000168_S0000101	3. THE CRESTED GECKO
YOU1000000168_S0000103	CREEPY, CRAWLY, BUT STILL KIND OF CUTE. DESPITE THEIR PREFERRED DIET OF CRICKETS AND MEALWORMS,
YOU1000000168_S0000105	THE CRESTED GECKO HAS A PRETTY GOOFY SMILE AND TINY HANDS.
YOU1000000168_S0000107	JUST LOOK AT THEM, THEY'RE SO TINY! AND THE EYES? WELL, WE'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU TO DECIDE.
YOU1000000168_S0000109	BUT ONE THING'S FOR SURE, THE CRESTED GECKO IS ONE OF THE CUTEST REPTILES YOU CAN OWN.
YOU1000000168_S0000111	THEIR LOW MAINTENANCE CARE AND FUNNY PERSONALITIES HAVE MADE THEM EXTREMELY POPULAR PETS.
YOU1000000168_S0000113	BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SIMPLE TO CARE FOR. CRESTED GECKOS MAKE EXCELLENT PETS FOR KIDS AND BEGINNER REPTILE PARENTS.
YOU1000000168_S0000115	IT IS NOW TIME FOR TODAY'S SUBSCRIBER PICK. WE ASKED OUR SUBSCRIBERS TO SEND IN THEIR PICTURES FOR THEIR CUTEST EXOTIC ANIMALS, AND TODAY'S THUMBNAIL PICK WAS SENT TO US BY A SUBSCRIBER WONDERING ABOUT
YOU1000000168_S0000116	THIS INCREDIBLE PICTURE OF A SMALL MONKEY HANGING WITH A HUMAN FINGER. SO WE LOOKED INTO IT AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S A FINGER MONKEY
YOU1000000168_S0000117	PYGMY MARMOSET THAT IS THE SMALLEST PRIMATE IN THE WORLD, VERY CLOSE TO OUR NUMBER 2 PICK FOR THE LIST. THEIR BABIES ARE 5 TO 6 INCHES TALL IN LENGTH
YOU1000000168_S0000118	AND WEIGHS AROUND 100 GRAMS. THESE SMALLEST MONKEYS ARE INDEED THE CUTEST ANIMALS IN TODAY'S VIDEO, BUT WE CANNOT INCLUDE THEM IN OUR LIST
YOU1000000168_S0000119	BECAUSE THEY ARE ILLEGAL TO OWN IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD
YOU1000000168_S0000121	2. THE CAPUCHIN MONKEY
YOU1000000168_S0000123	THE CUTE CAPUCHIN MONKEY IS A PRIMATE THAT IS OFTEN SEEN IN MOVIES AND TELEVISION. IT IS FAMOUS FOR ITS SMALL SIZE AND KNOWN FOR ITS PLAYFUL, MISCHIEVOUS ATTITUDE.
YOU1000000168_S0000124	REMEMBER JACK SPARROW'S MONKEY AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN?
YOU1000000168_S0000126	THEY ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT, TERRITORIAL, AND WILL LIVE UP TO 40 YEARS. THAT'S 40 YEARS OF DIAPERS, UNLESS YOU CAN TEACH YOUR MONKEY TO USE THE TOILET.
YOU1000000168_S0000128	BEFORE WE REVEAL NUMBER 1, BE SURE TO CHECK OUT OTHER AMAZING VIDEOS ON OUR CHANNEL AND GIVE US A LIKE IF YOU ENJOYED THIS VIDEO SO FAR.
YOU1000000168_S0000129	TELL US IN COMMENTS WHICH ONE OF THESE YOU LIKE THE MOST AND WHY.
YOU1000000168_S0000131	1. THE HERMIT CRAB
YOU1000000168_S0000133	IF YOUR DEFINITION OF A PET IS SWEET AND FLUFFY, THEN UNDERWATER CRAWLERS PROBABLY AREN'T THE FIRST THING THAT COME TO MIND.
YOU1000000168_S0000135	BUT HERE IS ONE LITTLE CRITTER THAT CAN MAKE YOUR AQUARIUM JUST A LITTLE BIT CUTER. NOT JUST FOR ITS BULGING EYES, BUT BECAUSE OF ITS DISTINCT PERSONALITY.
YOU1000000168_S0000137	UNLIKE MOST CRABS, HERMITS HAVE A SMALLER, SOFT ABDOMEN.
YOU1000000168_S0000139	WHICH THEY ADORABLY PROTECT BY LIVING IN AN EMPTY SNAIL SHELL.
YOU1000000168_S0000141	THEY MUST CONTINUE TO FIND LARGER SHELLS AS THEY GROW IN SIZE. SO THE OWNERS OF THESE PETS MUST PROVIDE PROGRESSIVELY LARGER SHELLS OVER THEIR LIFETIME.
YOU1000000168_S0000143	CREATING A VERY SPECIAL BOND BETWEEN CAREGIVER AND ANIMAL.
YOU1000000169_S0000001	HER EYES AND EARS THAT WERE CLOSED FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF HER LIFE ARE NOW OPENING.
YOU1000000169_S0000003	AND WITH THIS COMES A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF SENSORY STIMULATION.
YOU1000000169_S0000005	SHE USES HER VISION TO MOVE AROUND.
YOU1000000169_S0000007	BUT DOES SHE SEE THE WORLD THE SAME WAY WE DO?
YOU1000000169_S0000009	WELL, DOGS ARE COLORBLIND.
YOU1000000169_S0000011	BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYTHING IS BLACK AND WHITE.
YOU1000000169_S0000013	SHE DOES SEE COLOUR, BUT MOSTLY JUST BLUES AND YELLOWS.
YOU1000000169_S0000015	IT'S BECAUSE SHE ONLY HAS TWO TYPES OF COLOUR RECEPTORS, COMPARED TO HUMANS WHO HAVE THREE.
YOU1000000169_S0000017	AND IT'S ALSO WHY YOUR DOG WILL OFTEN IGNORE AN ORANGE TOY IN THE GREEN GRASS.
YOU1000000169_S0000019	AS THOSE COLOURS LOOK THE SAME TO THEM.
YOU1000000169_S0000021	BETTER TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING BLUE.
YOU1000000169_S0000023	BUT IT'S WHEN THINGS ARE MOVING THAT HER VISION COMES INTO ITS OWN.
YOU1000000169_S0000025	DOGS' EYES PROCESS WHAT THEY SEE MORE QUICKLY THAN WE DO.
YOU1000000169_S0000027	IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY SEE IN SLOW MOTION.
YOU1000000169_S0000029	THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ALWAYS IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO CATCH THE FRISBEE.
YOU1000000169_S0000031	PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR JOHN PILLEY WAS INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT HOW MANY WORDS A DOG COULD LEARN.
YOU1000000169_S0000033	AND SEVEN YEARS AGO, HE FOUND THE PERFECT STUDENT, JASON.
YOU1000000169_S0000035	USING CRATE LOADS OF TOYS, JOHN AND HIS COLLEAGUES DEVISED A GROUNDBREAKING STUDY OF CANINE INTELLIGENCE.
YOU1000000169_S0000037	THE TOYS ALL HAVE NAMES THAT CHASER HAS LEARNED THROUGHOUT HER LIFE AND JOHN PICKS EIGHT AT RANDOM.
YOU1000000169_S0000039	CHASE, LET'S PLAY SOME. CHASE, FIND PUNT. GO GET PUNT. BRAIN POP POP PUNT. DO IT, GO DO IT.
YOU1000000169_S0000040	YEAH, GOOD GIRL. CHASE, FIND ROACH.
YOU1000000169_S0000042	I'M ROACH. I WANT ROACH. GOOD GIRL.
YOU1000000169_S0000043	JOHN NEVER LOOKS AT THE TOYS ON THE MAT, SO TO PICK THE RIGHT OBJECT, CHASER HAS TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING.
YOU1000000169_S0000045	YEAH, THERE'S WOW. HINT UP, HINT UP.
YOU1000000169_S0000047	IN THREE YEARS OF INTENSIVE TRAINING, CHASER HAS LEARNED AN ASTOUNDING 1,022 WORDS.
YOU1000000169_S0000048	THAT'S 116 BALLS, 26 FRISBEES AND OVER 800 CLOTH ANIMALS. BUT HOW DOES SHE DO IT?
YOU1000000169_S0000050	ON THE MAT ARE FIVE ITEMS CHASE HER NOSE AND ONE NEW ONE SHE'S NEVER SEEN A CAT THAT JOHN CALLS MEOW
YOU1000000169_S0000051	CHASE, FIND MEOW, FIND MEOW, FIND MEOW. DO IT, GIRL, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, GIRL. BRING IT TO PAPA.
YOU1000000169_S0000052	WOW, VERY WELL DONE.
YOU1000000169_S0000053	THAT IT MIGHT REFER TO AN UNFAMILIAR OBJECT.
YOU1000000169_S0000055	CHASE, GET MEOW. I WANT MEOW. DO IT, GIRL. DO IT. RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000169_S0000057	THE WAY TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE IS BY A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION.
YOU1000000169_S0000059	GET MEOW. DO IT. DO IT.
YOU1000000169_S0000061	THERE'S MEOW. COME HERE.
YOU1000000169_S0000062	AFTER ONLY ONE TRIAL, THE NEW TOY AND THE SOUND MEOW ARE LODGED IN HER BRAIN.
YOU1000000169_S0000063	WATCH MEOW. CATCH MEOW. GOOD GIRL.
YOU1000000169_S0000065	AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS. TO SEE AFRICAN WILD DOGS IN THE FLESH IS A REAL PRIVILEGE.
YOU1000000169_S0000066	IT'S THOUGHT THERE MAY ONLY BE 3,000 LEFT IN THE WILD, MAKING THEM ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED MAMMALS IN AFRICA.
YOU1000000169_S0000068	ALADDIN, THE ALPHA MALE, WEARS THE RAGER COLLAR.
YOU1000000169_S0000070	IT REALLY IS QUITE FASCINATING TO WATCH THE ALPHA PAIR ALWAYS TOGETHER, ALWAYS TOGETHER.
YOU1000000169_S0000071	THE MALE IS CONSTANTLY TAILING BEHIND HER WHEREVER SHE GOES.
YOU1000000169_S0000073	ALADDIN AND FEATHER HAVE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER FOR FOUR MONTHS, BUT THEY'RE ALREADY OFF TO A FLYING START. FEATHER IS VISIBLY PREGNANT.
YOU1000000169_S0000076	BUT EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOW DONE THE JOB, SHE IS PREGNANT WITH HIS PUPS, HE DOESN'T LEAVE HER SIDE FOR ONE MINUTE.
YOU1000000169_S0000078	IT'S UNUSUAL FOR AN ALPHA MALE TO BE SO ATTENTIVE AT THIS STAGE. ALADDIN SEEMS TO BE A PARTICULARLY DEVOTED PARTNER.
YOU1000000169_S0000080	TARYN HAS BEEN MONITORING FEATHER AND ALADDIN'S PROGRESS FROM THE START. SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW ALADDIN AND FEATHER BEHAVE WITH EACH OTHER AS THE ALPHA PAIR.
YOU1000000169_S0000081	WE'VE OFTEN SEEN HIM WITH HIS CHIN RESTING ON HER REAR END AND JUST FOLLOWING HER AROUND. HE'S BEEN OBSERVED SLEEPING WITH HIS PAW ON HER AT NIGHT.
YOU1000000169_S0000082	IT'S TYPICAL, IT'S WHAT WE CALL MATE GUARDING BEHAVIOR. HE'S LOOKING AFTER HER, HE'S MAKING SURE THAT SHE'S FED AND HEALTHY.
YOU1000000169_S0000083	ONCE SHE'S PREGNANT, HE CONTINUES TO FOLLOW HER, EVEN THOUGH HE'S ALREADY DONE HIS JOB AND FATHERED HER LITTER.
YOU1000000169_S0000084	AND I THINK THAT'S HIS WAY OF ENSURING THAT HIS LITTER OF PUPS SURVIVES AND IS HEALTHY.
YOU1000000169_S0000086	ALADDIN AND FEATHER LOOK LIKE A SOLID COUPLE.
YOU1000000169_S0000088	AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR EVERYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP.
YOU1000000169_S0000090	BECAUSE AS THE ALPHA PAIR, IT'S THEIR JOB TO PROVIDE THE PACK WITH NEW PUPS.
YOU1000000169_S0000092	SO IS THAT IT? ARE THEY COMPLETELY ESTABLISHED AND THEIR ROLES ARE DETERMINED AND EVERYTHING'S HUNKY DORY WITH THE WHOLE PACK?
YOU1000000169_S0000093	WELL, SO FAR SO GOOD. THE KEY WILL BE HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE AT RAISING THAT LITTER OF PUPS AS A PACK.
YOU1000000169_S0000094	THE SUCCESS OF A PACK ALWAYS DEPENDS ON THEIR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, SO HOW WELL THEY WORK TOGETHER TO SUCCESSFULLY REAR THEIR YOUNG.
YOU1000000169_S0000095	SO THEY'RE NOT HOME FREE.
YOU1000000169_S0000096	NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.
YOU1000000169_S0000097	SO WHENEVER YOU GET A NEW ALPHA PAIR, IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING UNTIL THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY REARED THEIR FIRST LITTER. THEIR FIRST LITTER. OH GOSH, NO PRESSURE.
YOU1000000169_S0000099	FORTUNATELY FOR ALADDIN AND FEATHER, THE REST OF THE GROUP WILL BE THERE TO LEND A HELPING HAND.
YOU1000000169_S0000100	THE OTHER ADULT FEMALES ARE FEATHER SISTERS AND THE MALES COME FROM DIFFERENT PACKS.
YOU1000000169_S0000102	HERE COME THE REST BEHIND US.
YOU1000000169_S0000103	IT'S ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY WHERE EVERYONE PITCHES IN.
YOU1000000169_S0000105	THERE ARE A FEW PLACES ON SVALBARD WHERE PEOPLE LIVE YEAR ROUND. ONE OF THEM IS THE POLISH RESEARCH STATION AT HORNISUND.
YOU1000000169_S0000107	THEY'VE HAD BEARS VISIT THEM THIS YEAR, BUT NO FATAL RUN INS, THANKS TO A TRIED AND TESTED POLAR BEAR WARNING SYSTEM.
YOU1000000169_S0000109	LOLA, THAT'S MY DAUGHTER'S NAME.
YOU1000000169_S0000110	LILIANA KIZLINKA NAVRAT HAS WORKED AT THE BASE FOR ALMOST A YEAR.
YOU1000000169_S0000111	SHE'S THE BRAVEST ONE.
YOU1000000169_S0000112	SO IF A POLAR BEAR WALKS IN, THE DOGS START BARKING AND THEY SCARE IT OFF MOST TIMES? YES.
YOU1000000169_S0000114	DOGS LIKE LOLA BARK AS SOON AS THEY GET A WHIFF OF A BEAR.
YOU1000000169_S0000116	THIS GIVES THE RESEARCHERS TIME TO COME OUT WITH A FLARE GUN AND SCARE IT OFF.
YOU1000000169_S0000118	FOR LOLA HERE, HOW CLOSE HAS SHE BEEN TO A POLAR BEAR?
YOU1000000169_S0000119	WELL, SHE WAS ATTACKED THREE YEARS AGO.
YOU1000000169_S0000120	WAS SHE?
YOU1000000169_S0000121	YES, SHE HAD SOME STITCHES ON HER HERE, OVER HERE, ON THE LEG.
YOU1000000169_S0000123	AFTER SHE WAS ATTACKED BY THE POLAR BEAR, DID HER ATTITUDE CHANGE TOWARDS HIM? WAS SHE MORE SCARED?
YOU1000000169_S0000124	NO, SHE JUST GOT A LOT BRAVER.
YOU1000000169_S0000125	SHE'S GOT ON WITH HER JOB. FROM THE POLAR BEARS THAT YOU'VE SEEN COME THROUGH HERE, HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT SOME ARE MORE CURIOUS, THAT THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES?
YOU1000000169_S0000127	YES, YEAH. SOME ARE SCARED ONCE AND THEY GO AWAY, BUT SOME ARE REALLY JUST...
YOU1000000169_S0000129	SO STARVING, SO HUNGRY.
YOU1000000169_S0000131	I DO THINK IT'S GREAT THE WAY THAT THE DOG SENSES ARE USED TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE FROM POLAR BEARS. THEY'VE GOT AN EXCELLENT HEARING, FANTASTIC SENSE OF SMELL.
YOU1000000169_S0000132	AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN DETECT POLAR BEARS AS GOOD AS A DOG CAN.
YOU1000000169_S0000134	IT'S A SMALL SIGN OF HOPE. THERE ARE WAYS TO KEEP BOTH PEOPLE AND POLAR BEARS SAFE.
YOU1000000169_S0000136	MAX IS A RED COLLIE CROSS NORMALLY FULL OF ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM.
YOU1000000169_S0000137	BUT IN 2008, HIS OWNER MAUREEN BURNS NOTICED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
YOU1000000169_S0000139	I THOUGHT AT THE TIME MAX WAS FADING. HE WAS NINE AND A HALF.
YOU1000000169_S0000141	AND I WAS PREPARING MYSELF FOR LOSING HIM BECAUSE HE JUST WASN'T HAPPY. WOULDN'T COME WITH ME, WOULDN'T SIT BY ME, WOULDN'T SIT ON MY LAP.
YOU1000000169_S0000143	AND THE ODD SIGNS HE WOULD COME UP.
YOU1000000169_S0000145	AND TOUCH MY BREAST WITH HIS NOSE.
YOU1000000169_S0000147	AND BACK OFF SO DESPERATELY UNHAPPY THAT THERE'S SUCH A SAD LOOK IN HIS EYES.
YOU1000000169_S0000149	MAUREEN HAD A SMALL LUMP IN HER BREAST, BUT HER LATEST MAMMOGRAM WAS CLEAR, SO SHE PRESUMED ALL WAS OKAY.
YOU1000000169_S0000151	INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT'S JUST ANOTHER LUMPY BREAST AS PEOPLE GET.
YOU1000000169_S0000153	BUT THEN...
YOU1000000169_S0000155	I SORT OF CONNECTED IT WITH THE DOG, WITH HIS ODD BEHAVIOUR. AND ONE DAY I WAS LOOKING IN THE MIRROR IN THE BEDROOM HERE.
YOU1000000169_S0000157	AND I LOOKED ACROSS IN THE MIRROR AT MAX'S EYES. HE WAS ON THE BED, AS HE IS NOW. AND I KNEW IT WAS CANCER.
YOU1000000169_S0000159	MAUREEN WENT TO HER LOCAL HOSPITAL, BUT BOTH A SCAN AND A MAMMOGRAM CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
YOU1000000169_S0000161	IT TOOK A SURGICAL BIOPSY TO FINALLY DETECT THE CANCER.
YOU1000000169_S0000163	MAUREEN HAD IT REMOVED AND THE CHANGE IN MAX'S BEHAVIOUR WAS INSTANT.
YOU1000000169_S0000165	THE DAY I WAS PICKED UP FROM THE HOSPITAL.
YOU1000000169_S0000167	HE WAS HIS OLD HYPER SELF AGAIN.
YOU1000000169_S0000169	HE PUT HIS NOSE ACROSS MY BREAST TO CHECK WHERE THE OPERATION HAD BEEN AND HE WAS WAGGING HIS TAIL AND HIS EYES WERE HAPPY AND
YOU1000000169_S0000170	IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE, THE CHANGE IN HIM. INSTANT.
YOU1000000169_S0000172	I LOVE MAC SO MUCH AND I OWE HIM SO MUCH.
YOU1000000169_S0000174	AND EVEN BEFORE I GO FOR A CHECK UP NOW, I GET HIM TO CHECK ME OUT. AND IF HE'S HAPPY AND WAGGING HIS TAIL, I AM HAPPY.
YOU1000000169_S0000175	AND I KNOW I'M OKAY.
YOU1000000169_S0000177	WE NOW KNOW THAT DOGS LIKE MAX ARE SMELLING THE TINY VOLATILE CHEMICALS GIVEN OFF BY CANCEROUS TUMOURS.
YOU1000000169_S0000179	MOST DOGS CAN DO THIS. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE INTERESTED.
YOU1000000169_S0000181	BUT WITH A LITTLE TRAINING, DOGS CAN ACCURATELY PICK OUT A CANCEROUS PATIENT FROM A SELECTION OF URINE SAMPLES.
YOU1000000169_S0000182	GOOD GIRL. GOOD GIRL.
YOU1000000169_S0000184	THEY CAN EVEN BE TAUGHT TO LET DIABETICS LIKE STEPHEN KNOW THAT HIS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS ARE SMELLING LOW, LONG BEFORE HE CAN FEEL IT.
YOU1000000169_S0000185	AND DEFINITELY BEFORE HE PASSES OUT.
YOU1000000169_S0000187	DOGS LIKE STEPHEN'S ARE NOW TRANSFORMING LIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
YOU1000000169_S0000188	THEY'RE BEING TRAINED TO DETECT THE EARLY WARNING SIGNALS FOR SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTIONS, EPILEPTIC FITS AND NARCOLEPSY.
YOU1000000170_S0000001	I WORKED AT THIS PLACE, CWI.
YOU1000000170_S0000002	AND FOR MY THEN CURRENT PROJECT, WHICH WAS THE AMOEBA OPERATING SYSTEM, WHICH I WAS WORKING UNDER SAPO MELLANDER.
YOU1000000170_S0000003	ONE OF OUR PROJECTS WAS TO WRITE APPLICATION LEVEL UTILITIES
YOU1000000170_S0000004	FOR THIS NEW AMOEBA OPERATING SYSTEM.
YOU1000000170_S0000005	AND SO THERE WAS AN OPERATING SYSTEM KERNEL AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AT TALKING TO THE NETWORK
YOU1000000170_S0000006	AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AT MANAGING PROCESSES, BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH USER LEVEL SOFTWARE.
YOU1000000170_S0000007	THERE WAS BARELY A SHELL, I THINK THERE WAS A PORTED, VERY OLD UNIX SHELL, SOMETHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL UNIX VERSION 6 SHELL.
YOU1000000170_S0000008	BUT BECAUSE THE FILE SYSTEM MODEL ON AMOEBA WAS SO VERY DIFFERENT,
YOU1000000170_S0000009	WE COULDN'T TAKE AN EXISTING SUITE OF UNIX UTILITIES.
YOU1000000170_S0000010	AND SO WE WANTED IT TO BE SELF HOSTING.
YOU1000000170_S0000012	AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE REALIZED WE NEEDED A LARGE AMOUNT OF USER LEVEL SORT OF APPLICATIONS, UTILITIES, TOOLS.
YOU1000000170_S0000013	WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, FROM AN EDITOR TO A MAIL PROGRAM, TO A LOGIN UTILITY AND A BACKUP TOOL.
YOU1000000170_S0000014	AND ONE OF THE THINGS I REALIZED AS WE HAD A SMALL TEAM OF PEOPLE SORT OF WORKING ON THOSE THINGS,
YOU1000000170_S0000015	THAT IT WAS VERY SLOW GOING WRITING ALL THAT STUFF IN C AND IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTING OR SORT OF NOVEL.
YOU1000000170_S0000016	OR DIFFICULT AND OFTEN WE ALSO DIDN'T REALLY CARE HOW FAST THE CODE RAN.
YOU1000000170_S0000017	ALL THE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD WRITE A PIECE OF SOFTWARE IN C DIDN'T REALLY APPLY.
YOU1000000170_S0000018	THE ONLY REASON LEFT WAS THAT C WAS THE ONLY LANGUAGE FOR WHICH WE HAD A COMPILER.
YOU1000000170_S0000019	THERE WAS THIS ABC LANGUAGE THAT I HAD IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER LANGUAGE TO WRITE.
YOU1000000170_S0000020	A WHOLE BUNCH OF UTILITY APPLICATION TOOLS FOR AMOEBA.
YOU1000000170_S0000021	EXCEPT THAT ABC WAS SO HIGH AND ABSTRACT THAT IT REALLY
YOU1000000170_S0000023	IT WASN'T A GOOD LANGUAGE TO TALK TO SERVERS AND FILE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES.
YOU1000000170_S0000024	THE WHOLE OPERATING SYSTEM WAS ABSTRACTED AWAY FROM ABC.
YOU1000000170_S0000025	IT WAS ALMOST SOMETHING LIKE... I DON'T KNOW, IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE ABC COULD HAVE BECOME THE LANGUAGE OF SPREADSHEETS.
YOU1000000170_S0000026	IT WAS VERY GOOD FOR TALKING ABOUT A USER'S DATA.
YOU1000000170_S0000027	AND DOING ALL SORTS OF CLEVER STUFF WITH THAT DATA.
YOU1000000170_S0000028	IT DID THAT USING VERY GENERAL ALL PURPOSE DATA STRUCTURES LIKE LISTS AND DICTIONARIES.
YOU1000000170_S0000029	AND OF COURSE IT HAD VERY NICE CODE STRUCTURING DEVICES.
YOU1000000170_S0000030	LIKE A SMALL NUMBER OF SIMPLE STATEMENTS THAT COULD BE COMBINED IN ANY WAY YOU WANTED TO CREATE OTHER CONSTRUCTS.
YOU1000000170_S0000031	THE USUAL FUNCTION AND PROCEDURE ABSTRACTIONS.
YOU1000000170_S0000032	IT WAS NOT AT ALL AN OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE, ALTHOUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION HAD SOME OBJECTS SHINING THROUGH.
YOU1000000170_S0000033	ANYWAY, ABCS...
YOU1000000170_S0000035	AS IT EXISTED STILL, WASN'T USABLE.
YOU1000000170_S0000036	BUT SINCE I HAD WORKED ON THE ABC PROJECT, I KNEW EXACTLY HOW IT WAS BUILT.
YOU1000000170_S0000037	AND I HAD THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD THAT...
YOU1000000170_S0000039	GIVEN HOW MUCH TIME WE HAD AVAILABLE FOR OUR PROJECT, I COULD ACTUALLY BUILD A WHOLE NEW LANGUAGE, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT IT FROM SCRATCH.
YOU1000000170_S0000040	GIVEN WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT BOTH THE DESIGN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ABC AND START USING IT TO IMPLEMENT OUR SUITE OF TOOLS.
YOU1000000170_S0000041	AND STILL BE AHEAD OF THE GAME COMPARED TO A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD JUST HAVE SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000043	CLUNKED ON WRITING THE THINGS WE WANTED TO WRITE IN C.
YOU1000000170_S0000044	FOR THREE MONTHS.
YOU1000000170_S0000046	I DID MY DAY JOB AND AT NIGHT AND WHENEVER I GOT A CHANCE I KEPT WORKING ON PYTHON.
YOU1000000170_S0000047	I BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THREE MONTHS I WAS TO THE POINT WHERE I COULD TELL PEOPLE, LOOK, HERE, THIS IS WHAT I BUILT.
YOU1000000170_S0000048	AND IT HAD AN INTERACTIVE INTERPRETER LOOP.
YOU1000000170_S0000049	SO THE FIRST DEMOS WERE ALL, LET'S ASSIGN AN EXPRESSION TO A VARIABLE AND PRINT IT BACK.
YOU1000000170_S0000051	AND LET'S DEFINE A SMALL FUNCTION AND CALL IT AND LET'S PUT SOME LET'S PUT SOME THINGS IN AN ARRAY AND ITERATE OVER THE ARRAY
YOU1000000170_S0000053	AND ALL THOSE THINGS WORKED.
YOU1000000170_S0000055	AND
YOU1000000170_S0000057	SOMEHOW, AND I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW FAST THIS HAPPENED, BUT
YOU1000000170_S0000059	CERTAINLY MY TWO OFFICE MATES WERE ALMOST INSTANTLY TAKEN WITH IT AND STARTED HELPING OUT.
YOU1000000170_S0000061	AND THEY AND A FEW OTHERS WITHIN THE INSTITUTE WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS THING THAT I BUILT.
YOU1000000170_S0000063	AND STARTED SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000065	WE DIDN'T USE IT ON AMOEBA, BECAUSE IT WASN'T MATURE ENOUGH TO WRITE THE AMOEBA UTILITIES WE WANTED.
YOU1000000170_S0000066	BUT IT WAS ALREADY INSTANTLY USEFUL ENOUGH TO RUN ON OUR UNIX SYSTEM.
YOU1000000170_S0000067	PEOPLE WITHIN CWI, EVEN OUTSIDE MY OWN DEPARTMENT, STARTED USING IT.
YOU1000000170_S0000068	AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT WAS FUN AND PRODUCTIVE TO USE AND THEY USED IT FOR SMALL SCRIPTS.
YOU1000000170_S0000069	AND PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING THINGS LIKE.
YOU1000000170_S0000071	BUG FIXES. SOMEHOW THINGS WENT VERY QUICKLY DURING THAT FIRST YEAR.
YOU1000000170_S0000072	BY THE END OF 1990, A YEAR AFTER I STARTED, WE DEVELOPED A PLAN TO DO AN OPEN SOURCE RELEASE OF THIS LANGUAGE.
YOU1000000170_S0000074	AND THIS WAS BEFORE THE WORD OPEN SOURCE HAD EVEN BEEN COINED.
YOU1000000170_S0000075	SO WE DIDN'T CALL IT THAT BUT WE DID HAVE SOME MODELS WE HAD LIKE
YOU1000000170_S0000077	X11, THE WINDOWS SYSTEM AT THE TIME.
YOU1000000170_S0000078	HAD A DISTRIBUTION THAT WAS ONE OF THE SORT OF OPEN SOURCE EXAMPLES.
YOU1000000170_S0000079	WITH TWO COLLEAGUES, I WORKED ON BUILDING A DISTRIBUTION.
YOU1000000170_S0000080	ACTUALLY, IT TURNED OUT TO BE VERY SIMPLE.
YOU1000000170_S0000081	TO GET MANAGEMENT TO SIGN OFF ON THIS RELEASE.
YOU1000000170_S0000083	THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLY LUCKY STROKE.
YOU1000000170_S0000084	I JUST SORT OF...
YOU1000000170_S0000086	I ASKED MY MANAGER'S MANAGER, WHAT SHALL WE DO ABOUT THIS?
YOU1000000170_S0000087	AND HE SAID, OH, YOU GOT TO TALK TO THIS AND THIS PERSON IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH OF THE INSTITUTE.
YOU1000000170_S0000088	AND I TALKED TO THIS WOMAN, AND SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF ALL LEGAL AFFAIRS, I BELIEVE.
YOU1000000170_S0000089	AND I SAID, WELL, I HAVE WRITTEN THIS SOURCE CODE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RELEASE THAT AND I HAVE SORT OF...
YOU1000000170_S0000090	MADE UP A LICENSE THAT'S LIKE IDENTICAL TO THE MIT LICENSE. I COULD SAY MIT RELEASES SOFTWARE UNDER EXACTLY THIS LICENSE.
YOU1000000170_S0000091	AND WE JUST PUT THE FORMAL NAME OF OUR INSTITUTE IN THERE INSTEAD OF THE REGIONS OF THE INSTITUTE.
YOU1000000170_S0000092	SHE ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS LIKE...
YOU1000000170_S0000094	DID SOMEONE PAY FOR THIS TO BE DEVELOPED? AND MY ANSWER WAS NO. I STARTED THIS ALL IN MY OWN TIME.
YOU1000000170_S0000095	AND IT WAS FOR THIS RESEARCH PROJECT THAT SORT OF
YOU1000000170_S0000097	MY MANAGER IS FINE WITH IT.
YOU1000000170_S0000099	AND SO SHE SAID, SURE, GO AHEAD. AND WE DID IT.
YOU1000000170_S0000101	AND THAT'S SO THAT IN FEBRUARY 91, WE DID THE FIRST PYTHON RELEASE.
YOU1000000170_S0000103	AND IT FELT LIKE, AT THE TIME, LIKE AN INCREDIBLE MILESTONE. WE NEEDED TO POST IT TO USENET.
YOU1000000170_S0000104	THERE WAS THIS USENET NEWS GROUP THAT WOULD RECEIVE SOURCE CODE FOR RANDOM FREE PROJECTS.
YOU1000000170_S0000105	I GOT IMMEDIATELY STARTED GETTING USEFUL POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM WELL INITIALLY JUST FROM RANDOM PEOPLE
YOU1000000170_S0000106	WHO PICKED UP FREE SOFTWARE FROM USENET.
YOU1000000170_S0000107	WE QUICKLY SORT OF GOT INTO A ROUTINE OF DOING NEW PYTHON RELEASES.
YOU1000000170_S0000108	AND EVERY TIME
YOU1000000170_S0000110	I MEAN THERE WERE THE OBVIOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LANGUAGE AND THE LIBRARY AND BUG FIXES, A VERY IMPORTANT CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT WERE OFTEN CONTRIBUTED.
YOU1000000170_S0000111	WERE PORTS OR PORTING FIXES WHERE PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES, DIFFERENT COMPILERS
YOU1000000170_S0000112	THE UNIX WORLD WAS MUCH LESS HOMOGENEOUS AT THE TIME. THERE WERE LOTS OF SMALL UNIX VENDORS THAT HAD THEIR OWN COMPILERS OR THEIR OWN HARDWARE.
YOU1000000170_S0000113	ALL SORTS OF THINGS. SO THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPENED
YOU1000000170_S0000114	DURING SAY THE FIRST HALF OF THE 90S WAS A COMMUNITY OF PYTHON USERS AND DEVELOPERS SELF ORGANIZED.
YOU1000000170_S0000115	THEN CAME THE INVITATION TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.
YOU1000000170_S0000117	FROM NIST, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY. SO I SPENT TWO MONTHS THERE.
YOU1000000170_S0000118	WE ORGANIZED THE FIRST PYTHON WORKSHOP WHICH WAS HOSTED BY NIST.
YOU1000000170_S0000119	THROUGH THAT PYTHON WORKSHOP, I MET PEOPLE WHO OFFERED ME A JOB AND FROM 1995, I MEAN, I WENT BACK TO THE NETHERLANDS FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN FROM 1995 TO 2000,
YOU1000000170_S0000120	I WORKED IN THE US, IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AT CNRI.
YOU1000000170_S0000122	AND SO THERE WE WORKED THROUGH A LOT OF GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CREATED THE PYTHON WEBSITE.
YOU1000000170_S0000123	I GOT IN TOUCH WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL ACTIVE IN THE PYTHON COMMUNITY LIKE BARRY WARSAW.
YOU1000000170_S0000124	I THINK WHEN I STARTED THERE PYTHON 1.3 WAS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED.
YOU1000000170_S0000126	AND THEN WHILE I WAS THERE, WE RELEASED SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS LEADING UP TO 1.5.2.
YOU1000000170_S0000127	WHICH FOR SOME REASON 150 WAS NOTHING.
YOU1000000170_S0000128	BUT 152 REMAINED THE GOLD STANDARD OF PYTHON FOR A VERY LONG TIME AFTERWARDS.
YOU1000000171_S0000001	BUT GET BACK TO THE STANDARDIZATION. WE ARE STANDARDIZING C++ UNDER ISO RULES, WHICH ARE VERY OPEN PROCESS.
YOU1000000171_S0000002	PEOPLE COME IN, THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS FOR EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE.
YOU1000000171_S0000003	SO YOU STARTED TO DEVELOP C++ AND THERE'S A WHOLE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST STANDARD ESTABLISHED? WHAT IS THAT LIKE?
YOU1000000171_S0000004	THE ISO STANDARD IS THEIR COMMITTEE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHAT WAS THAT? LIKE HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET? WHAT'S THE DISCUSSION?
YOU1000000171_S0000005	I'LL TRY AND EXPLAIN THAT. SO, SOMETIME IN EARLY 1989,
YOU1000000171_S0000006	TWO PEOPLE, ONE FROM IBM, ONE FROM HP, TURNED UP IN MY OFFICE AND TOLD ME I WOULD LIKE TO STANDARDIZE C++.
YOU1000000171_S0000008	THIS WAS A NEW IDEA TO ME AND I POINTED OUT THAT IT WASN'T FINISHED YET AND IT WASN'T READY FOR FORMAL STANDARDIZATION.
YOU1000000171_S0000009	AND THEY SAY, NO, BJARNE, YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT. YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THIS. OUR ORGANIZATIONS DEPEND ON C++.
YOU1000000171_S0000010	WE CANNOT DEPEND ON SOMETHING THAT'S OWNED BY ANOTHER CORPORATION THAT MIGHT BE A COMPETITOR. OF COURSE WE COULD RELY ON YOU.
YOU1000000171_S0000011	BUT YOU MIGHT GET RUN OVER BY A BUS.
YOU1000000171_S0000013	WE REALLY NEED TO GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN. IT HAS TO BE STANDARDIZED UNDER FORMAL RULES.
YOU1000000171_S0000014	AND WE ARE GOING TO STANDARDIZE IT UNDER ISO RULES.
YOU1000000171_S0000015	AND YOU REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF IT BECAUSE BASICALLY OTHERWISE WE'LL DO IT OURSELVES.
YOU1000000171_S0000017	AND WE KNOW YOU CAN DO IT BETTER. SO THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ARM TWISTING AND FLATTERY,
YOU1000000171_S0000019	SO IN LATE...
YOU1000000171_S0000021	IN LATE 89, THERE WAS A MEETING IN DC AT THE, ACTUALLY NO, IT WAS NOT ISO THEN, IT WAS ANSI.
YOU1000000171_S0000022	THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD WE'RE DOING.
YOU1000000171_S0000024	WE MET THERE, WE WERE LECTURED ON THE RULES OF HOW TO DO AN NC STANDARD. THERE WAS ABOUT 25 OF US THERE.
YOU1000000171_S0000025	WHICH APPARENTLY WAS A NEW RECORD FOR THAT KIND OF MEETING. AND SOME OF THE OLD C GUYS THAT HAS BEEN STANDARDIZING C WAS THERE. SO WE GOT SOME EXPERTISE IN.
YOU1000000171_S0000026	SO THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THAT IT'S AN OPEN PROCESS. ANYBODY CAN SIGN UP IF THEY PAY THE MINIMAL FEE.
YOU1000000171_S0000027	WHICH IS ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS, A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW.
YOU1000000171_S0000028	AND I THINK IT'S $1280. IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL YOU. AND WE HAVE THREE MEETINGS A YEAR.
YOU1000000171_S0000029	THIS IS FAIRLY STANDARD. WE TRIED TWO MEETINGS A YEAR FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT DIDN'T WORK TOO WELL. SO THREE, ONE, TWO, THREE.
YOU1000000171_S0000031	WEEK MEETINGS A YEAR.
YOU1000000171_S0000033	AND YOU MEET AND YOU HAVE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS AND THEN YOU BRING PROPOSALS FORWARD FOR VOTES.
YOU1000000171_S0000034	THE VOTES ARE DONE ONE PERSON PER.
YOU1000000171_S0000036	ONE VOTE PER ORGANIZATION. SO YOU CAN'T HAVE, SAY, IBM COME IN WITH 10 PEOPLE AND DOMINATE THINGS. THAT'S NOT ALLOWED.
YOU1000000171_S0000037	AND THESE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT EXTENDS TO THE UC++.
YOU1000000171_S0000039	OR INDIVIDUALS.
YOU1000000171_S0000040	OR INDIVIDUALS. I MEAN, IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN A ROOM DECIDING THE DESIGN OF A LANGUAGE BASED ON WHICH A LOT OF THE WORLD'S SYSTEMS RUN.
YOU1000000171_S0000041	THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE IT'S BETTER THAN IF I DECIDED IT.
YOU1000000171_S0000042	OR BETTER THAN IF A SINGLE ORGANIZATION LIKE AT&T DECIDES IT.
YOU1000000171_S0000043	I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE AGREES TO THAT BY THE WAY. BUREAUCRACIES HAVE THEIR CRITICS TOO.
YOU1000000171_S0000044	YES, THEY'RE THE... LOOK, STANDARDIZATION IS NOT PLEASANT. IT'S HORRIFYING.
YOU1000000171_S0000045	IT'S LIKE DEMOCRACY.
YOU1000000171_S0000046	BUT WE EXACTLY AS CHURCHILL SAYS DEMOCRACY IS THE WORST WAY EXCEPT FOR ALL THE OTHERS RIGHT.
YOU1000000171_S0000047	AND IT'S I WOULD SAY THE SAME WITH FORMAL STANDARDIZATION. BUT ANYWAY, SO WE MEET AND WE HAVE THESE VOTES.
YOU1000000171_S0000049	AND THAT DETERMINES WHAT THE STANDARD IS. A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER WE EXTENDED THIS SO IT BECAME WORLDWIDE.
YOU1000000171_S0000050	WE HAVE STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN
YOU1000000171_S0000052	CURRENTLY 15 TO 20 COUNTRIES AND ANOTHER
YOU1000000171_S0000054	15 TO 20 ARE SORT OF LOOKING AND VOTING.
YOU1000000171_S0000056	BASED ON THE REST OF THE WORK ON IT. AND WE MEET THREE TIMES A YEAR. NEXT WEEK I'LL BE IN COLOGNE, GERMANY.
YOU1000000171_S0000057	SPENDING A WEEK DOING STANDARDIZATION AND WE WILL VOTE OUT THE COMMITTEE DRAFT OF C++20
YOU1000000171_S0000059	WHICH GOES TO THE NATIONAL STANDARDS COMMITTEES FOR COMMENTS AND REQUESTS FOR CHANGES.
YOU1000000171_S0000060	IMPROVEMENTS, THEN WE DO THAT AND THERE'S A SECOND SET OF VOTES WHERE HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY VOTES IN FAVOR. THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES.
YOU1000000171_S0000061	THE FIRST TIME WE FINISHED, WE STARTED IN, THE FIRST TECHNICAL MEETING WAS IN 1990, THE LAST WAS IN 98.
YOU1000000171_S0000062	WE VOTED IT OUT. THAT WAS THE STANDARD THAT PEOPLE USED TILL 11 OR A LITTLE BIT PAST 11. AND IT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD.
YOU1000000171_S0000063	ALL THE COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR. IT TOOK LONGER WITH 11, AND I'LL MENTION WHY.
YOU1000000171_S0000064	BUT ALL THE NATIONS VOTED IN FAVOR. AND WE WORK ON THE BASIS OF CONSENSUS.
YOU1000000171_S0000065	THAT IS, WE DO NOT WANT SOMETHING THAT PASSES 60 40. BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GETTING DIAL INS AND OPPONENTS AND PEOPLE COMPLAIN TOO MUCH.
YOU1000000171_S0000066	THEY WON'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH, BUT BASICALLY IT HAS NO REAL EFFECT. THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN OBEYED.
YOU1000000171_S0000067	THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE MANY COMPILERS, MANY COMPUTERS, AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF.
YOU1000000171_S0000069	AND SO THE FIRST, IT WAS TRADITIONAL WITH ISO STANDARDS TO TAKE 10 YEARS. WE DID THE FIRST ONE IN EIGHT, BRILLIANT.
YOU1000000171_S0000071	AND WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO THE NEXT ONE IN SIX BECAUSE NOW WE ARE GOOD AT IT.
YOU1000000171_S0000072	RIGHT.
YOU1000000171_S0000073	IT CHOKED.
YOU1000000171_S0000075	13.
YOU1000000171_S0000076	YEAH, IT WAS NAMED OX.
YOU1000000171_S0000077	THE
YOU1000000171_S0000078	I THOUGHT WE WOULD GET SIX, SEVEN OR EIGHT. THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH.
YOU1000000171_S0000079	YES, RIGHT. WELL, THE POINT IS THAT THIS WAS SORT OF LIKE A SECOND SYSTEM EFFECT. THAT IS, WE NOW KNEW HOW TO DO IT AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT MUCH BETTER.
YOU1000000171_S0000080	AND WE GOT MORE AMBITIOUS AND IT TOOK LONGER. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS THIS TENDENCY BECAUSE IT'S A 10 YEAR CYCLE
YOU1000000171_S0000082	OR AGE, DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU1000000171_S0000084	JUST BEFORE YOU'RE ABOUT TO SHIP, SOMEBODY HAS A BRIGHT IDEA.
YOU1000000171_S0000086	YEAH.
YOU1000000171_S0000087	AND SO WE REALLY, REALLY MUST.
YOU1000000171_S0000089	GET THAT IN.
YOU1000000171_S0000091	WE DID THAT SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE STL.
YOU1000000171_S0000093	STL STUFF. THAT BASICALLY I THINK IT SAVES YOU.
YOU1000000171_S0000094	IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
YOU1000000171_S0000095	YES, AND THEN PEOPLE TRIED IT WITH OTHER THINGS AND IT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL. THEY GOT THINGS IN BUT IT WASN'T AS DRAMATIC.
YOU1000000171_S0000096	AND IT TOOK LONGER AND LONGER AND LONGER.
YOU1000000171_S0000098	SO AFTER C++11, WHICH WAS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT AND BASICALLY WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE USING TODAY,
YOU1000000171_S0000100	WE DECIDED NEVER AGAIN.
YOU1000000171_S0000102	AND SO HOW DO YOU AVOID THOSE SLIPS? AND THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU SHIP MORE OFTEN.
YOU1000000171_S0000103	SO THAT IF YOU HAVE A SLIP ON A 10 YEAR CYCLE,
YOU1000000171_S0000105	BY THE TIME YOU KNOW IT'S A SLIP, THERE'S 11 YEARS TILL YOU GET IT.
YOU1000000171_S0000106	YEAH.
YOU1000000171_S0000107	NOW WITH A THREE YEAR CYCLE, THERE IS ABOUT FOUR YEARS TILL YOU GET IT.
YOU1000000171_S0000108	LIKE, YEAH.
YOU1000000171_S0000109	THE DELAY BETWEEN FEATURE FREEZE AND SHIPPING, SO YOU ALWAYS GET ONE OR TWO YEARS MORE.
YOU1000000171_S0000110	AND SO WE SHIPPED 14 ON TIME, WE SHIPPED 17 ON TIME, AND WE WILL SHIP 20 ON TIME.
YOU1000000171_S0000112	IT'LL HAPPEN. AND FURTHERMORE, THIS GIVES A PREDICTABILITY THAT ALLOWS THE IMPLEMENTERS, THE COMPILER IMPLEMENTERS, THE LIBRARY IMPLEMENTERS,
YOU1000000171_S0000113	SO, THEY HAVE A TARGET AND THEY DELIVER ON IT. 11 TOOK TWO YEARS FOR MOST COMPILERS WERE GOOD ENOUGH.
YOU1000000171_S0000115	MOST COMPILERS WERE ACTUALLY GETTING PRETTY GOOD IN 14. 17, EVERYBODY SHIPPED IN 17.
YOU1000000171_S0000116	WOW
YOU1000000171_S0000117	WE ARE GOING TO HAVE...
YOU1000000171_S0000119	AT LEAST ALMOST EVERYBODY SHIP ALMOST EVERYTHING IN 20. AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE SHIPPING IN 19.
YOU1000000171_S0000121	PREDICTABILITY IS GOOD, DELIVERY ON TIME IS GOOD, AND SO, YEAH.
YOU1000000171_S0000122	THAT'S GREAT.
YOU1000000171_S0000123	THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU1000000172_S0000001	OKAY, I'M GONNA UNBOX OUR OWN PLANTS
YOU1000000172_S0000002	I JUST GOT THEM AND NOT THIS DOG BRUSH. MY HUSBAND JUST GAVE ME THAT BUT I FIGURED LET ME JUST DO THIS AND SHOW YOU THE REALITY.
YOU1000000172_S0000003	OH, I CAN'T SHOW YOU MY ADDRESS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT... WAIT A MINUTE, THIS ACTUALLY MIGHT BE SOME OF MY CLOTHING.
YOU1000000172_S0000005	THIS IS SOME OF MY CLOTHING. THIS IS CLOTHING THAT I SHIPPED BACK FROM WHEN I WAS IN FLORIDA. SO THAT'S NOT A PLANT, BUT THIS IS A PLANT. THIS IS A PLANT.
YOU1000000172_S0000006	SO I DON'T USE SCISSORS, I USE MY FINGERNAILS. MAYBE IT'S CRINGY FOR YOU, BUT THAT'S HOW I OPEN UP TAPE. I JUST KIND OF RIP IT OPEN LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000172_S0000007	YOU KNOW, I STILL GET EXCITED OPENING UP PLANTS, EVEN THOUGH I SHIP A LOT OF PLANTS. OOH, OOH, I'M EXCITED.
YOU1000000172_S0000009	LIKE I NEED MORE PLANTS. I DO NEED MORE PLANTS. I WAS JUST THINKING TO MYSELF, I NEED QUITE A FEW MORE PLANTS BECAUSE WHEN I WASN'T HERE, I WASN'T HERE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME DURING THE PANDEMIC. I WAS IN FLORIDA AND I REALLY COULDN'T COME BACK HOME.
YOU1000000172_S0000010	SO IT WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I GAVE A LOT OF MY PLANTS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY BECAUSE IT WASN'T FAIR THAT MY HUSBAND WAS TAKING CARE OF THEM.
YOU1000000172_S0000011	SO I GOT RID OF THEM AND NOW I REGRET IT. SO I HAVE SEE, THIS IS THESE ARE FOUR PLANTS IN ONE BOX AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT WE HAVE
YOU1000000172_S0000012	I'M EXCITED. I KIND OF KNOW WHAT THEY ARE, BUT THEY WERE SHIPPED TO ME BECAUSE I NEED TO HAVE THEM HERE BECAUSE I NEED PLANTS. I NEED PLANTS.
YOU1000000172_S0000013	NEED MORE FLATS YOU CAN CUT THE STRING IF YOU WANT, BUT I'D LIKE TO NOT CUT THE STRING BECAUSE I LIKE TO USE IT
YOU1000000172_S0000014	SO I JUST GENTLY RELEASE.
YOU1000000172_S0000016	THE
YOU1000000172_S0000018	CORD EDGE.
YOU1000000172_S0000019	AND THEN DO THAT.
YOU1000000172_S0000020	AND SO I JUST WANT TO REUSE THESE SLEEVES TOO, SO I TRY TO BE AS CAREFUL AS I CAN AND PULL IT FROM THE BOTTOM LIKE THIS.
YOU1000000172_S0000022	LET'S SEE. OKAY, COME ON, COME ON, YOU CAN DO THIS. DON'T RIP IT. AND I USE MY HAND AND I JUST... OH, THIS IS A MORGAN HAIR FERN.
YOU1000000172_S0000023	IT'S LITTLE, IT'S CUTE, AND I HAVE SOME WRAP AROUND IT THAT KEEPS THE SOIL DOWN.
YOU1000000172_S0000024	FOR NOW, WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON HAVING JUST ALL NATURAL MATERIALS AND WE'RE GETTING TO THAT POINT, BUT YOU CAN RECYCLE THAT. AND THEN YOU JUST TAKE THE PAPER AWAY.
YOU1000000172_S0000025	YEAH, SHREDDED PAPER IS WHAT REALLY HELPS KEEP THE SOIL DOWN. AND THIS CAME, THIS SHOWED UP PRETTY NICELY. LOOK AT THAT. IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF LITTLE LEAVES. A COUPLE OF LITTLE LEAVES DIDN'T DO SO WELL.
YOU1000000172_S0000026	BUT THE SOIL IS NICE AND MOIST. IT STILL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. THERE'S JUST ONE ONE LITTLE STEM THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GET PLANTS IN THE MAIL
YOU1000000172_S0000027	BUT LOOK AT THAT. I CLEANED IT UP A LITTLE BIT TO SHOW YOU. THE MAIDENHAIR FERN. IT TRAVELED PRETTY WELL. I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
YOU1000000172_S0000028	AND I'M DIRTY. I'M DIRTY. BY THE WAY, I'M WEARING PAJAMA BOTTOMS.
YOU1000000172_S0000029	I ACTUALLY, I WAS WEARING A SKIRT TODAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME. I DECIDED I WANTED TO DRESS UP FOR WHATEVER REASON JUST BECAUSE, I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS UP.
YOU1000000172_S0000030	SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO DO IT SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAYBE GONNA GO SOMEPLACE KIND OF EXCITING I DON'T KNOW OR YOU'RE READY TO GO AND SOMEONE SAID HEY, YOU'VE GOT A VERY EXCITING PLACE TO GO TO ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT REALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000172_S0000032	IT'S JUST, NINA, BI COLOR. GET OFF ME.
YOU1000000172_S0000033	I LOVE DRACENA. I HAVE TO TRANSPLANT ONE. I HAVE THIS ONE. I THINK THIS IS A MOONLIGHT. THIS ONE I'VE HAD FOREVER. I HAD TO TRANSPLANT IT, BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S ON THE TABLE.
YOU1000000172_S0000034	I'LL PUT THINGS ON THE TABLE THAT I KNOW I NEED TO DO STUFF WITH. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY IT'S ON THE TABLE. SO HERE'S A MOONLIGHT. I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE THAT ON HERE FOR, IT'S NOT A MOONLIGHT. THIS IS A BICOLOR.
YOU1000000172_S0000035	AND WE PUT THE BAMBOO IN THERE SO IT'S JUST, IF THE BOX ACCIDENTALLY GETS TURNED OVER, THE PLANT DOESN'T SQUISH ON ITSELF.
YOU1000000172_S0000037	HERE WE GO, IT'S A BICOLOR AND.
YOU1000000172_S0000039	THANK YOU.
YOU1000000172_S0000041	I'M KIND OF INTO FERNS LATELY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BECAUSE I LIKE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE. FERNS ARE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING. I HAVE A BLUE STAR FERN SOMEPLACE I THINK BEHIND ME THAT IS DOING REALLY, REALLY WELL.
YOU1000000172_S0000042	I HAD SOME RABBIT FOOT FERNS THAT I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE. AND I'VE GOT SOME OTHER FERNS. OKAY, I'M JUST, I'M DOING AN UNBOXING.
YOU1000000172_S0000044	IT'S COLD OUT, I KNOW. I'LL BE DONE IN A MINUTE, OKAY?
YOU1000000172_S0000046	THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO CARE FOR THAN THE MAIDENHAIR FERNS.
YOU1000000172_S0000048	THE MADE IN AMERICA FERNS DO NOT LIKE TO DRY OUT. THEY REALLY, REALLY DON'T. THE BUTTON FERNS CAN HANDLE A LITTLE BIT BETTER. REMEMBER, RECYCLE. THIS IS A RECYCLE PILE.
YOU1000000172_S0000050	REUSE IT TOO IF YOU WANT. YOU CAN GET CREATIVE. AND THEN REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE PAPER. THE PAPER SHOULD NOT STAY HERE.
YOU1000000172_S0000051	I'M JUST MAKING LITTLE PILES OF...
YOU1000000172_S0000053	SORRY.
YOU1000000172_S0000055	I CAN'T TAKE THE DIRT. THE DIRT'S EVERYWHERE.
YOU1000000172_S0000057	SO THERE'S A BUTTON FERN.
YOU1000000172_S0000059	BUTTON FERN AND MAIDENHAIR FERN. AND WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE BOX? THOSE WERE THREE. THERE WERE THREE PLANTS IN THAT BOX. AND I'VE GOT ONE. I DON'T THINK IT'S MY CLOTHING. I THINK IT'S A PLANT.
YOU1000000172_S0000060	SO.
YOU1000000172_S0000062	YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THEY DON'T SHUT THE BOX IN SUCH A PRETTY CONDITION. AND SO JUST LET US KNOW ABOUT THAT. AND THEN WE HAVE
YOU1000000172_S0000064	OH BOY, OH BOY, I THINK I KNOW WHAT THIS IS. THIS IS A TYPE OF PRAYER PLANT.
YOU1000000172_S0000065	AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN A SECOND. AGAIN, I REALLY LIKE TO KEEP THE PLANT SLEEVE IN ONE PIECE.
YOU1000000172_S0000066	AND THIS IS A CALATHEA WORSWESII. AND THIS ONE IS FLOWERING AND IT'S STILL FLOWERING A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000172_S0000067	I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN SEE IT, BUT THE FLOWERS ARE KIND OF FADING. BUT THIS IS PRETTY, IT'S PRETTY DRY. IT NEEDS TO BE WATERED. YOU CAN SEE THE FOLIAGE IS A LITTLE FLOPPY A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000172_S0000068	THAT'S KIND OF NORMAL. THERE'S YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. IT'S A PLANT. THERE'S SOIL. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO NOT HAVE THE SOIL COME OUT.
YOU1000000172_S0000069	SO WE TRY REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HARD TO KEEP THE SOIL IN THE POT. BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS PUT THE SOIL BACK IN THE POT IF YOU FIND THAT IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX. SO WE HAVE A FLOWERING WARSAWESEI CALATHEA.
YOU1000000172_S0000070	AND WE DO HAVE A
YOU1000000172_S0000072	WHICH IS
YOU1000000172_S0000074	REALLY MEANT TO KEEP THE SOIL DOWN. YOU SEE THAT?
YOU1000000172_S0000075	COCO COIR. COCO COIR.
YOU1000000172_S0000077	THERE WE GO.
YOU1000000172_S0000079	HERE YOU GO, YOU STAY OVER THERE FOR NOW, I'M GONNA WATER YOU AFTER THIS. AND I THINK I HAVE ONE MORE. I HAVE ONE MORE. AND THIS BOX GOT, LOOK, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU.
YOU1000000172_S0000080	THIS MIGHT BE MY CLOTHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
YOU1000000172_S0000082	NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD POSTAL PEOPLE. NOT GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN HERE, BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU KNOW IN A SECOND AND WHAT KIND OF SHAPE IT'S IN.
YOU1000000172_S0000084	OH BOY, OH BOY. THERE'S A LOT OF PLANTS IN HERE.
YOU1000000172_S0000086	I KIND OF REALLY ENJOY THIS. I DON'T LIKE SEEING A SQUISHED BOX LIKE THAT. IT REALLY IRRITATES ME. AND I WONDER WHO DID THAT TO THAT BOX? HOW DID IT GET IN THAT SHAPE?
YOU1000000172_S0000087	DID THEY THROW IT OFF OF THE TRUCK? DID THEY PACK TOO MANY POTS AND BOXES ON TOP OF IT? MAYBE. I THINK I SHOULD PUT CAMERAS IN ALL THE BOXES SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
YOU1000000172_S0000089	IT'S A LITTLE TOO EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT.
YOU1000000172_S0000091	SO HERE WE HAVE AN 8 INCH RUFA BARBA. I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU RUFA BARBA.
YOU1000000172_S0000093	AND SEE, THE POCK GOT SQUISHED A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000172_S0000095	I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THAT, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME HAPPY. BUT THE PLANT'S STILL IN GOOD SHAPE, SO YOU COULD PROBABLY.
YOU1000000172_S0000097	EVENTUALLY WORK OUT WORK OUT THE KINKS IN THE POT OR PUT IT IN A COVER POT AND IT'LL JUST FILL OUT I DON'T KNOW. BUT YES, THIS IS THE CALATHEA RUFA BARBARA. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF LEAF DAMAGE ON THAT ONE, BUT I'LL JUST CUT THAT OFF.
YOU1000000172_S0000098	BUT IT'S IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE.
YOU1000000172_S0000099	IT'S SUCH A PRETTY PLANT THE D. I LOVE THE DEEP MAROONS ON THE BACKSIDES OF THE LEAF. THEY'RE SO PRETTY THERE'S A NEW LEAF. THE NEW LEAF IS LIGHT GREEN OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GO. WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?
YOU1000000172_S0000100	I JUST PUT THIS BIG TABLE HERE AND NOW I'M RUNNING OUT OF SPACE.
YOU1000000172_S0000101	THAT'S THAT!
YOU1000000172_S0000103	WE HAVE HERE, WE HAVE, IT'S AN ANTHURIUM. IT'S NOT A FLOWERING ANTHURIUM.
YOU1000000172_S0000105	IT DOESN'T REALLY FLOWER.
YOU1000000172_S0000106	AND IT'S NOT FOR THE FLOWER. I'M NOT HERE FOR THE FLOWERS IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
YOU1000000172_S0000108	AND THE LIGHT GREEN AND THE ART. OH, SO IT'S AN ANTHURIUM SUPERBUM.
YOU1000000172_S0000110	WHICH IS THIS IS A SIX INCH CONTAINER AND
YOU1000000172_S0000112	THESE DO REALLY, REALLY WELL. LOOK, IT'S LIKE A CUP. IT'S A PLANT CUP. DON'T DRINK OUT OF IT, OKAY? DO NOT DRINK OUT OF IT. IT LOOKS GREAT. YOU'RE A BEAUTY. LOOK HOW PRETTY. I KNOW I'M MOVING SO FAST.
YOU1000000172_S0000113	LOOK HOW PRETTY. DEEP EYES, DEEP, DARK EYES. I LOVE THAT.
YOU1000000172_S0000114	AND THEN WE HAVE A FEW MORE. DRACENA, WE HAVE A FEW MORE DRACENA.

YOU1000000174_S0000022	CODE BLUE, I SEE YOU NORTH AT 18.
YOU1000000174_S0000024	WE HAD THIS BUILT ON FRID OF THE SURGE CONTINUING T
YOU1000000174_S0000025	OUR ISO IS OVERWHELMED WITH PATIENTS, SO WE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE BUNK THEM IN HERE.
YOU1000000174_S0000026	OKAY.
YOU1000000174_S0000027	NORMALLY THESE PATIENTS WOULD BE IN THE ICU UPSTAIRS, BUT ALL OF THOSE BEDS ARE FULL. WE CREATED AN ADDITIONAL 10 BEDS OUTSIDE OF THE ICU. THOSE ARE ALL FULL.
YOU1000000174_S0000028	WE HAVE SIX MORE PATIENTS HOLDING IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND THEN WE CAN HOLD UP TO 24 MORE PATIENTS IN THIS AREA.
YOU1000000174_S0000029	IT IS COMPLETELY FULL RIGHT NOW. AS SOON AS ONE GOES OUT, ANOTHER ONE COMES IN. THEY ARE ALL COVID POSITIVE, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
YOU1000000174_S0000030	SO ONE, TWO.
YOU1000000174_S0000031	I NEED YOU NOW.
YOU1000000174_S0000032	42.
YOU1000000174_S0000033	I NEED THREE MORE DIVIDERS THEN, RIGHT?
YOU1000000174_S0000035	EVERYONE'S GETTING SICK WITH COVID AT THE SAME TIME, SO OUR STAFF ARE CALLING OUT FASTER THAN WE CAN GET STAFF IN.
YOU1000000174_S0000036	WE'VE RECEIVED A COUPLE TRAVELER NURSES FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECENTLY, WHICH IS WONDERFUL. BUT THE HARD PART IS THAT EVERYONE'S FIGHTING FOR THE SAME RESOURCES AT THE SAME TIME.
YOU1000000174_S0000038	ALL OF THE HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING.
YOU1000000174_S0000040	WE HAVE THE MEDICATIONS WE NEED THAT THE FDA HAS APPROVED. WE HAVE CONVALESCENT PLASMA FOR PATIENTS.
YOU1000000174_S0000041	WE HAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE PREVIOUSLY AND PATIENTS STILL... IT IS EFFECTIVE, BUT THESE PATIENTS ARE JUST SICKER. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT. IT SEEMS THAT ONCE WE GET FOLKS ON A VENTILATOR, IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET THEM OFF.
YOU1000000174_S0000043	WHERE'S THE A LINE? STRAIGHT OVER IN THE CENTER.
YOU1000000174_S0000045	JUST KEEP IT UP.
YOU1000000174_S0000047	HE'S A PERSON, HAPPENS TO BE A NEIGHBOR OF MINE. WE HAVE HAD FAMILY FRIENDS HERE. WE'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT I'VE KNOWN. SOME PEOPLE SUCCEED AND SOME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000174_S0000048	UNFORTUNATELY, COVID IS A TRAGIC PROCESS.
YOU1000000174_S0000050	I'VE SEEN APPROXIMATELY 10 PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OR THAT ARE FAMILY FRIENDS OR NEIGHBORS. THREE, THREE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE PASSED.
YOU1000000174_S0000051	SO, ON THREE, IT'S TOUGH, IT'S TOUGH SEEING ALL THAT.
YOU1000000174_S0000053	THERE'S A LOT OF WEIGHT ON THE SHOULDERS THAT WE ALL CARRY. IT'S DEPRESSING, BUT WE'RE ALL HOPEFUL. THAT'S THE THING I THINK THAT WE ALL CLING ON TO. HOPE.
YOU1000000174_S0000055	I'M A RELIGIOUS MAN, SO I PRAY WHILE I CAN. I GO HOME TO MY FAMILY, AND I LOOK AT THEM, AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ME HAPPINESS. THAT'S WHAT GETS ME OUT OF MY LITTLE DEPRESSION.
YOU1000000174_S0000059	I'M VERY TIRED TODAY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DAY IN A ROW WE'VE BEEN WORKING.
YOU1000000174_S0000060	I'VE BEEN WORKING 12, 15 HOURS EVERY DAY AS WE ALL HAVE BEEN. WE'RE HERE ON WEEKENDS, WE'RE HERE ON NIGHTS.
YOU1000000174_S0000061	WE'RE WATCHING OVER EACH OTHER, BUT YOU KNOW, WE'RE POURING OUR HEARTS OUT TO THE PATIENTS AND THE STAFF. IT'S HARD. I'M TIRED.
YOU1000000174_S0000063	THERE'S STILL A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING, POTENTIALLY IN THE COMMUNITY, ABOUT HOW IT SPREADS, HOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING IT.
YOU1000000174_S0000064	I DON'T THINK THEY REALIZE HOW HARD IT IS FOR THE FAMILIES WHEN YOU SEE THEM COME IN HERE AND HOLD THE HAND OF THEIR LOVED ONE THAT'S ABOUT TO DIE.
YOU1000000174_S0000066	WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUND VACCINE PLANNING, BUT ALSO REALISTICALLY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS RIGHT AWAY.
YOU1000000174_S0000067	THIS IS GOING TO TAKE MONTHS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE MONTHS FOR IT TO GET BETTER.
YOU1000000174_S0000069	YOU NEED TO WEAR YOUR MASK. YOU NEED TO SOCIAL DISTANCE. YOU NEED TO WASH YOUR HANDS.
YOU1000000174_S0000070	YOU REALLY NEED TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD.
YOU1000000174_S0000071	WE AS HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND CAREGIVERS ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE, TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WHILE THEY'RE HERE IN THE HOSPITAL.
YOU1000000174_S0000072	BUT IF SO MANY PEOPLE COME IN AND KEEP COMING IN LIKE THIS, IT WORRIES ME THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU OR ANY OF YOUR LOVED ONES SAFE ANY LONGER.
YOU1000000175_S0000000	MYTHS AND RUMORS CIRCULATE IN A VERY SIMILAR WAY TO THE WAY THAT MICROBES SPREAD. THEY CAN BE CONTAGIOUS IN THAT ONE PERSON HEARS SOMETHING,
YOU1000000175_S0000001	THEY PASS IT ON TO ANOTHER PERSON AND ANOTHER AND SUDDENLY A RUMOR BECOMES REALLY WELL ESTABLISHED. AND I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS PROBLEM.
YOU1000000175_S0000002	BUT WITH THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA, JUST THE SCALE, THE SCOPE AND THE SPEED OF IT IS REALLY AMPED UP. I'M DR. SEEMA YASMIN AND I'M A DOCTOR.
YOU1000000175_S0000003	A PROFESSOR AT STANFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DIRECTOR OF THE STANFORD CENTER FOR HEALTH COMMUNICATION. AND I'M GOING TO DEBUNK SOME ILLNESS AND DISEASE MYTHS.
YOU1000000175_S0000005	PEOPLE KIND OF WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD I BE DRINKING, BUT THERE ISN'T THAT MAGIC NUMBER.
YOU1000000175_S0000006	I THINK THIS MYTH HAS BEEN CIRCULATING FOR A LONG TIME AND SOMEHOW EIGHT GLASSES OF AN EIGHT OUNCE GLASS SPECIFICALLY IS WHAT'S CIRCULATED.
YOU1000000175_S0000007	IT DEPENDS ON YOUR BODY SIZE AND HOW ACTIVE YOU ARE AT A GIVEN TIME.
YOU1000000175_S0000009	THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT YOUR PLACENTA. I DO HEAR FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO EAT THEIR PLACENTA
YOU1000000175_S0000010	BECAUSE MONKEYS OR OTHER WILD ANIMALS DO IT. BUT THE REASON THAT THOSE ANIMALS ARE DOING IT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ATTRACT PREDATORS.
YOU1000000175_S0000011	THERE IS NO REASON FOR A HUMAN TO EAT A PLACENTA.
YOU1000000175_S0000013	YOUR HEART DOES NOT SKIP A BEAT WHEN YOU SNEEZE. I THINK A LOT OF US GROW UP HEARING THINGS ABOUT SNEEZING, THAT YOUR EYES CLOSE.
YOU1000000175_S0000014	AND YOUR HEART SKIPS A BEAT AND YOU'RE LIKE DEAD FOR A MILLISECOND OR SOMETHING. YEAH, CLEARLY NOT TRUE.
YOU1000000175_S0000016	ADULTS HAVE FEWER BONES THAN BABIES, AND THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE, BECAUSE BABIES ARE BORN WITH SOME BONES THAT FUSE TO BECOME A BIGGER BONE.
YOU1000000175_S0000018	THERE IS A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE JULY EFFECT, WHICH WONDERS AND ASKS THIS QUESTION THAT IF YOU HAVE MASSIVE TURNOVER,
YOU1000000175_S0000019	NEW RESIDENTS STARTING, NEW FACULTY STARTING AROUND JULY, THEN ISN'T THAT A MORE DANGEROUS TIME TO BE IN HOSPITAL? AND THERE HAVE BEEN 300 STUDIES LOOKING INTO THIS.
YOU1000000175_S0000020	AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL IT IS, WHO YOU'RE BEING LOOKED AFTER, LIKE HOW EXPERIENCED THEY ARE, BUT ALSO WHAT KIND OF ILLNESS YOU ARE AND HOW SERIOUSLY SICK YOU ARE.
YOU1000000175_S0000021	THE TAKE HOME FROM THIS IS THAT IF YOU'RE SICK IN JULY, YOU STILL NEED TO GO TO A HOSPITAL AND BY AND LARGE, YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.
YOU1000000175_S0000023	SO YOUR BODY MAKES TOXINS AS IT METABOLIZES DIFFERENT THINGS, BUT THE THING IS YOUR BODY ALSO FLUSHES THOSE THINGS OUT.
YOU1000000175_S0000024	YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DOING ANYTHING OR TAKING ANYTHING TO CLEANSE YOURSELF. FLAT TUMMY TEA IS MOST OF THEM ARE NOT GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU1000000175_S0000025	THEY KIND OF GO UNDER THIS UMBRELLA OF, OH WELL IT'S NATURAL OR IT'S HERBAL, BUT THOSE HERBS ARE NO JOKE. SOMETIMES FLAT TUMMY TEAS CONTAIN SENNA.
YOU1000000175_S0000026	WHICH YES, IT'S A HERB, BUT IT'S ALSO A LAXATIVE. SO IF YOU WANT TO CRAP THE WAY OUT, I MEAN, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS EMPTYING YOUR BOWELS AND BECOMING DEHYDRATED.
YOU1000000175_S0000028	YOUR BODY DOES HAVE WASTE PRODUCTS IN IT, THAT'S WHY YOU PEE AND THAT'S WHY YOU POOP AND EVEN WHEN YOU BREATHE YOU ARE EXHALING CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IS A WASTE PRODUCT.
YOU1000000175_S0000029	BUT YOUR BODY IS PERFECTLY PRIMED TO DO THAT, TO GET RID OF WHAT YOU DON'T NEED. PEOPLE DO ASK ABOUT COLONICS. YOU DO NOT NEED THEM.
YOU1000000175_S0000030	YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT COFFEE UP YOUR BUTT. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SHOVING LIQUIDS UP THERE TO GET ANYTHING OUT. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE CONSTIPATION AND THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES AN ENEMA, BUT IF YOU'RE HEALTHY AND FUNCTIONING FINE, THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO DO A COLONIC.
YOU1000000175_S0000032	PEOPLE ARE MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS THAT MANY OF US DON'T NEED, AND THAT INCLUDES VITAMINS.
YOU1000000175_S0000033	IF YOU ARE EATING A WELL BALANCED DIET, YOU'RE GETTING THE VITAMINS THAT YOU NEED AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE POPPING A PILL TO STAY HEALTHY.
YOU1000000175_S0000034	YOU NEED TO TAKE A VITAMIN IF YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TELLS YOU YOU HAVE A DEFICIENCY AND YOU NEED TO TOP UP AND TAKE A PILL OR TAKE A LIQUID THAT BOOSTS YOUR LEVEL OF THAT VITAMIN.
YOU1000000175_S0000036	MSG IS NOT ADDICTIVE, IT'S NOT UNSAFE, AND THE THING THAT I WAS FASCINATED WITH WHEN I WAS WRITING THIS WAS THAT THOSE MYTHS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MSG,
YOU1000000175_S0000037	THAT IT'S ADDICTIVE, THAT IT'S REALLY BAD FOR YOU, ARE ALL TIED TO RACISM. AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHINESE PEOPLE OWNING CHINESE RESTAURANTS THAT WERE USING IT, AND THAT'S HOW IT GOT LABELED AS SOMETHING THAT WAS DIRTY AND TOXIC.
YOU1000000175_S0000038	IN MODERATION, IT'S NO WORSE FOR YOU THAN REGULAR SALT.
YOU1000000175_S0000040	PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME IF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD IS SAFE, WHETHER IT SHOULD PAY MORE FOR NON GMO FOOD, PAY MORE FOR ORGANIC FOOD, BUT GMO FOOD IS SAFE.
YOU1000000175_S0000041	AND THE DEFINITION OF ORGANIC HONESTLY CAN BE SO BROAD AND VAGUE AND DIFFERENT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER THAT MOST DOCTORS WILL SAY
YOU1000000175_S0000042	JUST EAT A HEALTHY, BALANCED, VARIED DIET, AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO PAY MORE FOR ORGANIC FOR MOST FOODS.
YOU1000000175_S0000044	I DO GET ASKED ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS A LOT BECAUSE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS LIKE TO CHUG DIET SODAS. THE THING TO BEAR IN MIND HERE IS THAT SOME OF THE STUDIES ARE NOT THAT ROBUST
YOU1000000175_S0000045	SO YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HEADLINES SAYING DIET SODAS CAUSE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE OR DIET SODA CAUSES STROKE.
YOU1000000175_S0000046	AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TRUE. AND THE THING THAT I WORRY ABOUT THEN IS WILL PEOPLE DITCH THE DIET SODA AND JUST START DRINKING SUGARY SODA WHEN WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE LINKED TO DIABETES AND OTHER ILLNESSES.
YOU1000000175_S0000047	ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS, THE KIND THAT YOU FIND IN DIET SODAS, DO NOT CAUSE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
YOU1000000175_S0000049	STROKE AND CANCER. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN HEADLINES THAT SAY THAT, BUT I THINK THAT THEY ARE MISCONSTRUING WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ARE REALLY SHOWING.
YOU1000000175_S0000050	THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES SHOWING SOME HARMFUL EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS IN RATS.
YOU1000000175_S0000051	BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT WITH A LARGE GRAIN OF SALT TO SAY THAT, WELL, JUST BECAUSE IT DID SOMETHING IN A RODENT'S BODY, WILL THAT TRANSLATE INTO HAPPENING IN A HUMAN'S BODY?
YOU1000000175_S0000052	BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL, YOU CAN JUST DRINK WATER.
YOU1000000175_S0000055	THAT'S A GREAT MESSAGE.
YOU1000000175_S0000057	YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT TALLER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A CENTIMETRE THOUGH, AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE GRAVITY COMPRESSES YOUR JOINTS DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY.
YOU1000000175_S0000058	IT'S ALSO WHY WHEN ASTRONAUTS COME BACK TO EARTH AFTER A SPACE MISSION, THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT TALLER THAN WHEN THEY LEFT EARTH.
YOU1000000175_S0000060	THERE ARE STUDIES SHOWING THAT BAD TEETH, ESPECIALLY BAD GUMS, CAN LEAD TO HEART DISEASE AND MAKE YOU MORE SUSCEPTIBLE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE BACTERIA.
YOU1000000175_S0000061	THAT CAUSES GUM DISEASE CAN CIRCULATE THROUGH THE BLOOD AND CAUSE ILLNESS ELSEWHERE. IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT MAKES US LOOK AT THE PATIENT HOLISTICALLY.
YOU1000000175_S0000062	SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO EAT WELL, BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET GOOD DENTAL HYGIENE AND GET ROUTINE CHECKUPS TO MAKE SURE YOUR GUMS ARE AS HEALTHY AS EVERYTHING ELSE.
YOU1000000175_S0000064	THERE ARE SOME STUDIES THAT ARE QUITE EXCITING THAT SHOW THAT ASPIRIN, WHICH WE ALREADY RECOMMEND FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS, MIGHT LOWER THE RISK OF CANCER.
YOU1000000175_S0000065	BUT THERE'S STILL MORE RESEARCH BEING DONE AND THERE AREN'T A TON OF MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS SAYING, HEY, EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE AN ASPIRIN PILL EVERY DAY TO PREVENT CANCER.
YOU1000000175_S0000066	WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS THAT IT'S CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ABOUT ASPIRIN THAT PREVENTS METASTATIC CANCER, THAT PREVENTS CANCER CELLS FROM MOVING AROUND THE BODY.
YOU1000000175_S0000067	BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE, IT MIGHT BE THAT THE ASPIRIN WORKS FOR THAT ONLY IN SOME PEOPLE AND NOT IN EVERYONE.
YOU1000000175_S0000068	I GET SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ASPIRIN BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE EVERY YEAR WE DISCOVER A NEW USE FOR IT. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE DRUG.
YOU1000000175_S0000069	BUT THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON ASPIRIN PREVENTING CANCER.
YOU1000000175_S0000071	PLEASE DO NOT STOP TAKING AN ANTIBIOTIC THE MOMENT YOU FEEL BETTER, IF YOU STILL HAVE MORE TO COMPLETE THE COURSE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU HAVE 10 DAYS OF PILLS.
YOU1000000175_S0000072	BUT YOU FEEL BETTER ON DAY FOUR OR DAY THREE EVEN, YOU STILL HAVE TO FINISH THAT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS SO THAT THE BUG DOES NOT BECOME RESISTANT TO THE MEDICINE.
YOU1000000175_S0000074	ANTIBIOTICS CANNOT HELP WITH A COLD. MOST COLDS, MOST SORE THROATS ARE CAUSED BY VIRUSES AND ANTIBIOTICS WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO THOSE.
YOU1000000175_S0000075	ANTIBIOTICS FIGHT BACTERIA VERY SPECIFICALLY, SO IF YOU HAVE A VIRUS CIRCULATING IN YOUR BLOOD, TAKING AN ANTIBIOTIC WILL NOT HELP.
YOU1000000175_S0000077	IT'S BEEN CIRCULATING FOR AGES THAT YOU SHOULD STARVE A FEVER AND FEED A COLD. YOU JUST NEED TO EAT WELL AND STAY HYDRATED WHEN YOU'RE NOT WELL.
YOU1000000175_S0000078	IT IS DANGEROUS TO STARVE YOURSELF. LIKE THAT'S A THING THAT WE KNOW THAT'S PROVEN. SO IF YOU HAVE A FEVER, STAY HYDRATED AND EAT WELL.
YOU1000000175_S0000080	THE FLU SHOT CAN DEFINITELY NOT CAUSE THE FLU. THE FLU SHOT MIGHT MAKE YOU ACHY, BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, GETTING THE FLU SHOT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA.
YOU1000000175_S0000081	YOU WILL NOT GET THE FLU FROM IT AND IT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE.
YOU1000000175_S0000083	I THINK WE ALL GREW UP HEARING THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER GO OUTSIDE IN THE COLD WHEN YOUR HAIR IS WET OR LIKE MAKE SURE YOU BUNDLE UP AND OUR MOTHERS LOVE DOING THAT TO US.
YOU1000000175_S0000084	DURING COLD TIMES IS WHEN THERE ARE MORE COLD BUGS CIRCULATING ANYWAY. AND ALSO THERE IS SOME RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT COLD WEATHER MIGHT IMPACT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.
YOU1000000175_S0000085	BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT ROBUST. I THINK IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA THOUGH TO WRAP UP VERY WARM.
YOU1000000175_S0000087	YOU DO NOT LOSE MORE HEAT FROM YOUR HEAD THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON YOUR BODY.
YOU1000000175_S0000089	YOU CAN TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S MAKING SOMEBODY SICK FROM LOOKING AT THE COLOR OF THEIR SPUTUM, WHICH IS THE DISGUSTING THING THAT YOU COUGH UP.
YOU1000000175_S0000090	FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT'S VERY CLEAR, THAT'S LESS LIKELY TO BE AN INFECTION USUALLY. IF IT'S GREEN OR YELLOW, MORE LIKELY TO BE A BACTERIAL OR VIRAL INFECTION.
YOU1000000175_S0000091	I THINK DOCTORS ARE GOOD AT ASSESSING THE COLOR OF SPUTUM WHEN PEOPLE ARE COUGHING UP OUT OF THEIR LUNGS. IF YOU ARE EMPTYING YOUR NOSE INTO A TISSUE,
YOU1000000175_S0000092	PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE COLOR TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT BACTERIA IS CAUSING IT, THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING YOU CAN ASSESS.
YOU1000000175_S0000094	PEOPLE WONDER IF THEIR EARS STOP GROWING WHEN THE REST OF THEM STOPS GROWING AND ACTUALLY YOUR EARS CARRY ON GROWING FOREVER.
YOU1000000175_S0000096	SO THE CURRENT GUIDELINES IN THE US ARE THAT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN CAN ONLY DONATE BLOOD IF THEY'VE BEEN CELIBATE FOR 12 MONTHS, WHICH IS LUDICROUS AND STUPID AND UNSCIENTIFIC.
YOU1000000175_S0000097	IT WASN'T UNTIL 2015, 30 YEARS AFTER WE HAD A TEST FOR HIV AIDS,
YOU1000000175_S0000098	THAT GAY MEN AND BISEXUAL MEN WERE TOLD, YES, YOU CAN DONATE BLOOD, BUT THERE WAS A MAJOR CAVEAT.
YOU1000000175_S0000099	AND THAT CAVEAT WAS THAT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN COULD ONLY DONATE BLOOD IF THEY HAD BEEN CELIBATE FOR 12 MONTHS.
YOU1000000175_S0000101	VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM. I MAY GET THAT TATTOOED ON MY FACE AT SOME POINT IN 2020. I'M KIND OF BEING SARCASTIC HERE.
YOU1000000175_S0000102	THAT IF A PATIENT WAS TO ASK ME THAT, I WOULD TAKE THEIR CONCERNS REALLY SERIOUSLY AND NOT BE DISMISSIVE BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY THINK THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I REASSURE THEM.
YOU1000000175_S0000103	THAT VACCINES ARE SAFE AND WHAT THEY CAUSE IS A LONG LIFE AND GOOD HEALTH.
YOU1000000175_S0000105	THE BEST WAY TO DISINFECT YOUR HANDS IS TO WASH THEM VERY WELL WITH WATER AND SOAP AND THEN TO RUB THEM CLEAN.
YOU1000000175_S0000107	HAND SANITIZER IS GOOD IF YOU'RE IN A BIND, BUT IT IS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS WASHING YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER. I GET ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ALCOHOL GEL,
YOU1000000175_S0000108	HAND SANITIZER AND DISINFECTANT WIPES, AND THEY ARE REALLY USEFUL. THEY DO DISINFECT SURFACES.
YOU1000000175_S0000109	BUT NOTHING IS EQUIVALENT TO DISINFECTING YOUR HANDS AS WASHING THEM WITH SOAP AND WATER.
YOU1000000175_S0000111	IT'S TRUE THAT MANY PATIENTS CARED FOR BY A FEMALE DOCTOR HAVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THE PATIENTS DO BETTER.
YOU1000000175_S0000112	THEY LIVE LONGER, THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL IF THEY ARE CARED FOR BY A DOCTOR WHO IS A WOMAN.
YOU1000000175_S0000113	AND AT THE SAME TIME, WOMEN DOCTORS FACE LOTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND GET PAID LESS THAN OUR MALE COUNTERPARTS.
YOU1000000175_S0000115	IT'S HARD TO AVOID MISINFORMATION SOMETIMES. THERE IS SO MUCH FALSE HEALTH NEWS CIRCULATING.
YOU1000000175_S0000116	AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST FEEL OVERWHELMED EVEN WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION. I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS TO TALK TO A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN TRUST.
YOU1000000175_S0000117	WHO HAS AN OPEN MIND AND SOMEONE THAT GIVES YOU THE TIME AND SPACE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY CONCERNING YOU.
YOU1000000176_S0000001	CELLS ARE THE SMALLEST LIVING UNITS OF AN ORGANISM.
YOU1000000176_S0000003	ALL CELLS HAVE THREE THINGS IN COMMON, NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF CELL THEY ARE.
YOU1000000176_S0000005	ALL CELLS HAVE A CELL MEMBRANE WHICH SEPARATES THE INSIDE OF THE CELL FROM ITS ENVIRONMENT.
YOU1000000176_S0000007	CYTOPLASM, WHICH IS A JELLY LIKE FLUID, AND DNA, WHICH IS THE CELL'S GENETIC MATERIAL.
YOU1000000176_S0000009	THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF CELLS.
YOU1000000176_S0000011	THE FIRST CATEGORY IS EUKARYOTIC CELLS. THEY HAVE ORGANELLES WHICH INCLUDE THE NUCLEUS AND OTHER SPECIAL PARTS.
YOU1000000176_S0000013	EUKARYOTIC CELLS ARE MORE ADVANCED, COMPLEX CELLS, SUCH AS THOSE FOUND IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS.
YOU1000000176_S0000015	THE SECOND CATEGORY IS PROKARYOTIC CELLS.
YOU1000000176_S0000016	THEY DON'T HAVE A NUCLEUS OR MEMBRANE ENCLOSED ORGANELLES.
YOU1000000176_S0000017	THEY DO HAVE GENETIC MATERIAL, BUT IT'S NOT CONTAINED WITHIN A NUCLEUS.
YOU1000000176_S0000018	PROKARYOTIC CELLS ARE ALWAYS ONE CELLED OR UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS, SUCH AS BACTERIA.
YOU1000000176_S0000020	SO, WHAT ARE ORGANELLES?
YOU1000000176_S0000021	ORGANELLE MEANS LITTLE ORGAN.
YOU1000000176_S0000023	ORGANELLES ARE THE SPECIALIZED PARTS OF A CELL THAT HAVE UNIQUE JOBS TO PERFORM.
YOU1000000176_S0000025	LET'S START WITH THE NUCLEUS, THE CONTROL CENTER OF THE CELL.
YOU1000000176_S0000027	THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS DNA, OR GENETIC MATERIAL.
YOU1000000176_S0000028	DNA DICTATES WHAT THE CELL IS GOING TO DO AND HOW IT'S GOING TO DO IT.
YOU1000000176_S0000029	CHROMATIN IS THE TANGLED, SPREAD OUT FORM OF DNA FOUND INSIDE THE NUCLEAR MEMBRANE.
YOU1000000176_S0000031	WHEN A CELL IS READY TO DIVIDE, DNA CONDENSES INTO STRUCTURES KNOWN AS CHROMOSOMES.
YOU1000000176_S0000033	THE NUCLEUS ALSO CONTAINS A NUCLEOLUS.
YOU1000000176_S0000035	WHICH IS A STRUCTURE WHERE RIBOSOMES ARE MADE.
YOU1000000176_S0000037	AFTER RIBOSOMES LEAVE THE NUCLEUS, THEY WILL HAVE THE IMPORTANT JOB OF SYNTHESIZING OR MAKING PROTEINS.
YOU1000000176_S0000039	OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS, THE RIBOSOMES AND THE REST OF THE ORGANELLES FLOAT AROUND IN CYTOPLASM, WHICH IS THE JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE.
YOU1000000176_S0000041	RIBOSOMES MAY WANDER FREELY WITHIN THE CYTOPLASM.
YOU1000000176_S0000043	OR ATTACH TO THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM, SOMETIMES ABBREVIATED AS ER.
YOU1000000176_S0000044	THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ER. ROUGH HAS RIBOSOMES ATTACHED TO IT.
YOU1000000176_S0000045	AND SMOOTH DOESN'T HAVE RIBOSOMES ATTACHED TO IT.
YOU1000000176_S0000047	THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM IS A MEMBRANE ENCLOSED PASSAGEWAY FOR TRANSPORTING MATERIALS, SUCH AS THE PROTEINS SYNTHESIZED BY RIBOSOMES.
YOU1000000176_S0000049	PROTEINS AND OTHER MATERIALS EMERGE FROM THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM IN SMALL VESICLES.
YOU1000000176_S0000051	WHERE THE GOLGI APPARATUS, SOMETIMES CALLED THE GOLGI BODY, RECEIVES THEM.
YOU1000000176_S0000053	AS PROTEINS MOVE THROUGH THE GOLGI BODY, THEY'RE CUSTOMIZED INTO FORMS THAT THE CELL CAN USE.
YOU1000000176_S0000055	THE GOLGI BODY DOES THIS BY FOLDING THE PROTEINS INTO USABLE SHAPES.
YOU1000000176_S0000056	OR ADDING OTHER MATERIALS ONTO THEM, SUCH AS LIPIDS.
YOU1000000176_S0000058	OR CARBOHYDRATES.
YOU1000000176_S0000060	VACUOLES ARE SAC LIKE STRUCTURES THAT STORE DIFFERENT MATERIALS.
YOU1000000176_S0000061	HERE IN THIS PLANT CELL, THE CENTRAL VACUOLE STORES WATER.
YOU1000000176_S0000063	GOING BACK TO THE ANIMAL CELL, YOU WILL SEE AN ORGANELLE CALLED A LYSOSOME.
YOU1000000176_S0000064	LYSOSOMES ARE THE GARBAGE COLLECTORS THAT TAKE IN DAMAGED OR WORN OUT CELL PARTS.
YOU1000000176_S0000065	THEY ARE FILLED WITH ENZYMES THAT BREAK DOWN THIS CELLULAR DEBRIS.
YOU1000000176_S0000067	THE MITOCHONDRION IS AN ORGANELLE THAT IS THE POWERHOUSE FOR BOTH ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS.
YOU1000000176_S0000069	DURING A PROCESS CALLED CELLULAR RESPIRATION, THE MITOCHONDRIA MAKE ATP MOLECULES THAT PROVIDE THE ENERGY FOR ALL OF THE CELL'S ACTIVITIES.
YOU1000000176_S0000071	CELLS THAT NEED MORE ENERGY HAVE MORE MITOCHONDRIA.
YOU1000000176_S0000073	MEANWHILE, THE CELL MAINTAINS ITS SHAPE THROUGH A CYTOSKELETON.
YOU1000000176_S0000075	THE CYTOSKELETON INCLUDES THE THREAD LIKE MICROFILAMENTS, WHICH ARE MADE OF PROTEIN.
YOU1000000176_S0000077	AND MICROTUBULES, WHICH ARE THIN, HOLLOW TUBES.
YOU1000000176_S0000079	SOME ORGANISMS, SUCH AS PLANTS, THAT ARE PHOTOAUTOTROPHIC
YOU1000000176_S0000081	MEANING THEY CAPTURE SUNLIGHT FOR ENERGY.
YOU1000000176_S0000083	HAVE CELLS WITH AN ORGANELLE CALLED A CHLOROPLAST.
YOU1000000176_S0000085	THE CHLOROPLAST IS WHERE PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAPPENS.
YOU1000000176_S0000087	IT'S GREEN BECAUSE IT HAS A GREEN PIGMENT CALLED CHLOROPHYLL.
YOU1000000176_S0000089	PLANT CELLS ALSO HAVE A CELL WALL OUTSIDE OF THEIR CELL MEMBRANES THAT SHAPE, SUPPORT, AND PROTECT THE PLANT CELL.
YOU1000000176_S0000091	ANIMAL CELLS NEVER HAVE A CELL WALL.
YOU1000000176_S0000093	THERE ARE MANY OTHER UNIQUE STRUCTURES THAT ONLY SOME CELLS HAVE.
YOU1000000176_S0000095	HERE ARE JUST A FEW. IN HUMANS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RESPIRATORY TRACT IS LINED WITH CELLS THAT HAVE CILIA.
YOU1000000176_S0000096	THESE ARE MICROSCOPIC HAIR LIKE PROJECTIONS THAT CAN MOVE IN WAVES.
YOU1000000176_S0000097	THIS FEATURE HELPS TRAP INHALED PARTICLES IN THE AIR AND EXPELS THEM WHEN YOU COUGH.
YOU1000000176_S0000099	ANOTHER UNIQUE FEATURE IN SOME CELLS IS FLAGELLA. SOME BACTERIA HAVE FLAGELLA.
YOU1000000176_S0000100	A FLAGELLUM IS LIKE A LITTLE TAIL THAT CAN HELP A CELL MOVE OR PROPEL ITSELF.
YOU1000000176_S0000102	THE ONLY HUMAN CELL THAT HAS A FLAGELLUM IS A SPERM CELL.
YOU1000000176_S0000104	IN SUMMARY, REMEMBER...
YOU1000000176_S0000105	EUKARYOTIC CELLS ARE PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS WITH A NUCLEUS AND MEMBRANE ENCLOSED ORGANELLES.
YOU1000000176_S0000107	WHILE PROKARYOTIC CELLS ARE UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS WITHOUT THESE THINGS.
YOU1000000176_S0000109	ALL CELLS HAVE A CELL MEMBRANE, CYTOPLASM, AND GENETIC MATERIAL.
YOU1000000176_S0000111	AND EVEN THOUGH ONLY PLANT CELLS HAVE CHLOROPLASTS, BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS HAVE MITOCHONDRIA.
YOU1000000177_S0000000	COFFEE. DID YOU KNOW THAT OVER 400 BILLION CUPS OF COFFEE ARE CONSUMED EVERY YEAR?
YOU1000000177_S0000001	COFFEE, ALSO KNOWN AROUND MY HOUSE AS LIQUID GOLD, IS THE SECOND MOST TRADED COMMODITY IN THE WORLD, ONLY BEHIND OIL. IN TODAY'S VIDEO, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHY COFFEE IS NOT BAD FOR YOU,
YOU1000000177_S0000002	AND THE NINE SCIENTIFIC BENEFITS TO HAVING A DAILY CUP OF JOE.
YOU1000000177_S0000003	I WILL ALSO FINISH WITH SOME SHORT FAQS ABOUT THE BEST TIMES TO DRINK COFFEE, HOW MUCH PER DAY IS OKAY, AND HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH.
YOU1000000177_S0000004	WHEN PEOPLE SAY COFFEE IS BAD FOR YOU, THEY OFTEN POINT TO A FEW THINGS. INSOMNIA, DEHYDRATION, AND ADRENAL FATIGUE.
YOU1000000177_S0000005	INSOMNIA IS USUALLY JUST A RESULT OF DRINKING COFFEE TOO EARLY. SINCE EFFECTS CAN LAST UP TO 10 HOURS AFTER DRINKING, SIMPLY STOP DRINKING COFFEE BEFORE NOON AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.
YOU1000000177_S0000006	DEHYDRATION. YES, COFFEE IS A NATURAL DIURETIC, BUT THIS PROBLEM IS CURED BY DRINKING MORE WATER, WHICH YOU SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY.
YOU1000000177_S0000007	AND ADRENAL FATIGUE. THIS IS NOT EVEN A REAL MEDICAL CONDITION. ANYONE SPOUTING THIS SORT OF NONSENSE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR TIME OR ATTENTION.
YOU1000000177_S0000008	HERE ARE THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF DRINKING COFFEE BACKED BY SCIENTIFIC STUDIES. NUMBER ONE, COFFEE CAN HELP YOU BURN FAT.
YOU1000000177_S0000009	CAFFEINE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BOOST METABOLISM BY UP TO 11% AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE FAT BURNING POTENTIAL.
YOU1000000177_S0000010	OTHER STUDIES HAVE EVEN SHOWN THAT THE RATE OF FAT BEING BURNED WHILE DRINKING CAFFEINE CAN IMPROVE BY 10% IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS AND 29% IN LEAN INDIVIDUALS.
YOU1000000177_S0000011	NUMBER TWO, COFFEE HELPS YOU EXERCISE BETTER. CAFFEINE HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTS EVER FOR IMPROVING EXERCISE OUTPUT.
YOU1000000177_S0000012	DRINKING COFFEE CAUSES A SPIKE IN ADRENALINE AND CAUSES AN INCREASE IN EXERCISE PERFORMANCE BY AROUND 11 12%. 3. YOUR HEART SEEMS TO LIKE IT
YOU1000000177_S0000013	DRINKING UP TO TWO COFFEE CUPS PER DAY CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART FAILURE BY UP TO 11%. NUMBER FOUR, COFFEE CAN MAKE YOU SMARTER.
YOU1000000177_S0000014	IT ENHANCES THE FIRING OF NEURONS IN THE BRAIN AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE VARIOUS BRAIN FUNCTIONS INCLUDING MOOD, ENERGY LEVELS, REACTION TIME, MEMORY, AND GENERAL COGNITIVE FUNCTION.
YOU1000000177_S0000015	NUMBER 5 COFFEE CONTAINS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ANTIOXIDANTS. THESE ANTIOXIDANTS HELP FIGHT FREE RADICALS IN THE BODY,
YOU1000000177_S0000016	AND SCIENTISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND DIFFERENT ANTIOXIDANTS IN THE COFFEE BEAN ALONE. NUMBER SIX, COFFEE DRINKERS HAVE A LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER.
YOU1000000177_S0000017	ASTONISHINGLY, COFFEE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER THE CHANCES OF GETTING LIVER CANCER BY UP TO 40%.
YOU1000000177_S0000018	ALSO, A STUDY WITH OVER 400,000 MEMBERS SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO CONSUMED COFFEE HAD A LOWER RISK OF RECTAL CANCER BY 15%.
YOU1000000177_S0000019	NUMBER SEVEN, COFFEE CONTAINS ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS THE BODY LOVES AND NEEDS. ONE CUP OF COFFEE CONTAINS NUTRIENTS LIKE RIBOFLAVIN, POTASSIUM, MAGNESIUM, AND OTHERS.
YOU1000000177_S0000020	WHILE THE VOLUME OF THE NUTRIENTS IT CONTAINS IS NOT GOING TO BLOW YOU AWAY,
YOU1000000177_S0000021	IF YOU DRINK 3 CUPS PER DAY, LIKE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ADULT, YOU'LL BE GETTING A STEADY SOURCE OF VITAL NUTRIENTS THAT YOUR BODY LOVES.
YOU1000000177_S0000022	8. COFFEE CAN FIGHT DEPRESSION MOST PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE OF THE FACT THAT OVER 17.5 MILLION PEOPLE, JUST IN AMERICA ALONE, SUFFER FROM SOME FORM OF DEPRESSION
YOU1000000177_S0000023	AND IT'S GROWING EVERY YEAR. DRINKING COFFEE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER THE RISK OF DEVELOPING DEPRESSION BY UP TO 20% FOR WOMEN.
YOU1000000177_S0000024	IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT THOSE WHO DRINK UP TO FOUR CUPS PER DAY ARE 53% LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT.
YOU1000000177_S0000025	NUMBER 9, COFFEE DRINKERS HAVE A LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING CERTAIN DISEASES. TYPE 2 DIABETES NOW AFFECTS OVER 300 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE AND IS BECOMING A GLOBAL PROBLEM.
YOU1000000177_S0000026	HEAVY COFFEE DRINKERS, HOWEVER, HAVE A 23% TO 67% REDUCTION IN RISK OF DEVELOPING THE DISEASE.
YOU1000000177_S0000027	ALSO, DRINKING COFFEE RESULTS IN A 32% TO 60% REDUCTION IN RISK FOR DEVELOPING PARKINSON'S AS WELL.
YOU1000000177_S0000028	THESE OVERALL STUDIES SHOW THAT COFFEE IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART, BRAIN, AND YOUR BODY. THE BEST TIME OF DAY TO DRINK COFFEE IS AROUND ONE HOUR AFTER WAKING UP OR 30 MINUTES BEFORE YOUR WORKOUT.
YOU1000000177_S0000029	USE A DRIP COFFEE MAKER IF POSSIBLE. OTHER POPULAR MACHINES USE PLASTIC CUPS THAT ARE UNRECYCLABLE AND ARE VERY DAMAGING TO OUR PLANET.
YOU1000000177_S0000030	HOW MUCH PER DAY IS OKAY? A SHORT RULE OF THUMB IS 2 CUPS A DAY IS FINE, 3 CUPS A DAY IS GOOD, AND 4 CUPS A DAY SHOULD BE THE ABSOLUTE MAX.
YOU1000000177_S0000031	FINALLY, DRINK YOUR COFFEE BLACK. MOST OF THE SPECIALTY DRINKS AT COFFEE SHOPS ARE CALORIE NIGHTMARES AND ARE BASICALLY GLORIFIED MILKSHAKES.
YOU1000000177_S0000032	DRINKING IT BLACK TAKES SOME TIME TO GET USED TO, BUT JUST LIKE AN ACQUIRED TASTE TO WINE, IT GETS BETTER WITH TIME.
YOU1000000177_S0000033	GOT A TOPIC YOU WANT THE HEALTH NERD TO COVER? JUST PUT IT IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW. AND ACCORDING TO THE LATEST RESEARCH, FOR EVERY NEW SUBSCRIBER I GET, AN ADORABLE BABY SLOTH IS BORN.

YOU1000000177_S0000035	WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY BUILDING OUT SOME INCREDIBLE RESOURCES TO HELP YOU TAKE YOUR HEALTH TO THE NEXT LEVEL. CHEERS.
YOU1000000178_S0000000	WE USE THE POURING TECHNIQUE TO CREATE A LOVELY PATTERN ON THE SURFACE OF THE DRINK.
YOU1000000178_S0000002	AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GIVE YOU GUYS A CHANCE TO GET A PICTURE OF THIS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATCH OUR STANDARDS.
YOU1000000178_S0000004	HELLO, MY NAME IS MICHAEL PHILLIPS. I'M THE 2010 WORLD BARISTA CHAMPION AND THE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE INTERNATIONALLY.
YOU1000000178_S0000005	AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A CAPPUCCINO.
YOU1000000178_S0000006	NOW, FOR CAPPUCCINO YOU'VE GOT SOME CORE INGREDIENTS. WE'VE GOT SOME WONDERFUL COFFEE. TODAY WE'RE USING THE HAYES VALLEY ESPRESSO.
YOU1000000178_S0000007	YOU HAVE DELICIOUS ICE COLD MILK. YOU'VE GOT, OF COURSE, WATER BEING PLUMBED INTO YOUR EQUIPMENT. AND YOU'LL HAVE ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO MAKE THAT SAME DELICIOUS DRINK THAT WE MAKE FOR YOU IN OUR SHOPS.
YOU1000000178_S0000008	ONE OF THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF A CAPPUCCINO IS THAT IT'S ABOUT A FIVE TO SIX OUNCE BEVERAGE, SO IT'S USUALLY NICE AND PROPER. THAT KEEPS THE RATIO NICE AND TIGHT.
YOU1000000178_S0000009	SO THE VERY FIRST STEP
YOU1000000178_S0000011	BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CUP'S NICE AND HOT.
YOU1000000178_S0000013	I'M GONNA ADD A LITTLE WATER OFF THE MACHINE HERE. THIS IS GONNA KEEP IT AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE.
YOU1000000178_S0000015	SO THAT IT MAINTAINS ALL OF THE HEAT AND WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUR MILK TO SUCH A HIGH TEMPERATURE, WHICH LETS US KEEP A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE SWEETNESS OUT OF IT.
YOU1000000178_S0000017	THE NEXT STEP, WE WANT TO GET OUR PUCK READY. SO THIS IS REFERRED TO AS A PORTAFILTER. YOU GOT THE BASKET RIGHT HERE.
YOU1000000178_S0000019	THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR COFFEE THAT YOU'VE GROUND AND ARE PREPARING TO EXTRACT.
YOU1000000178_S0000020	YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND CLEAN AND DRY, WHICH IS WHAT WE USE OUR PORTAFILTER TOWEL FOR.
YOU1000000178_S0000021	AND WE'RE REALLY PRECISE ABOUT THIS. SO WE ACTUALLY USE DIGITAL SCALES TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SUPER SPECIFIC ON IT, DOWN TO THE TENTH OF A GRAM.
YOU1000000178_S0000023	GOT OUR GRINDER HERE. I'M GOING TO RUN JUST A LITTLE BIT THROUGH TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WE'RE GETTING IS NICE AND FRESH.
YOU1000000178_S0000025	SO OUR GRINDER IS GOING TO DOSE A TIMED OUT VERSION OF COFFEE INTO HERE.
YOU1000000178_S0000026	BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS PRECISE AS WE WANT SO WE DOUBLE CHECK. SO RIGHT NOW I'M AT 19.5 I WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE
YOU1000000178_S0000028	AND THERE WE GO. NOW I'M AT 26, SO I HAVE TO USE THIS PROCESS. THIS NEXT STEP IS CALLED LEVELING.
YOU1000000178_S0000029	AND THAT'S WHERE WE SHIFT THE COFFEE GROUNDS AROUND THE TOP OF THE BASKET TO TRY AND GET A NICE AND EVEN SURFACE.
YOU1000000178_S0000030	SO THE NEXT STEP, YOU WANT TO COMPRESS THIS BED OF COFFEE DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT.
YOU1000000178_S0000031	TO DO THAT WE USE THIS RIGHT HERE. THIS IS A TAMPER.
YOU1000000178_S0000032	IT'S LIKE A CHEF'S KNIFE. EVERYBODY HAS ONE THAT FITS THEIR HAND JUST RIGHT.
YOU1000000178_S0000033	YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR PORTAFILTER IS NICE AND LEVEL. YOU WANT A LINE COMING STRAIGHT UP FROM THAT THROUGH YOUR ELBOW.
YOU1000000178_S0000034	AND THEN YOU COMPACT IT.
YOU1000000178_S0000036	NICE AND EVENLY.
YOU1000000178_S0000037	THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND LEVEL.
YOU1000000178_S0000039	BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT HOW FAST THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE PUCK.
YOU1000000178_S0000040	SO NOW THAT WE HAVE THE PORTAFILTER TAMPED, WE'RE READY TO LOCK IT IN AND START PULLING YOUR SHOTS.
YOU1000000178_S0000042	SO WE WANT TO GET THE WATER OUT OF THAT CUP.
YOU1000000178_S0000043	AGAIN, WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SCALE UP HERE.
YOU1000000178_S0000044	THE THREE BIG VARIABLES WE PAY ATTENTION TO IS THE DOSE, SO THE AMOUNT OF COFFEE, THE YIELD, THE AMOUNT OF ESPRESSO GOING INTO THE CUP,
YOU1000000178_S0000045	AND THE TIME THAT IT TAKES. I'VE GOT A LITTLE TIMER RIGHT HERE.
YOU1000000178_S0000046	SO, FLUSH A LITTLE WATER THROUGH THE GROUP HEAD.
YOU1000000178_S0000048	WE'LL LOCK IT IN NICE AND TIGHT, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PULL THAT SHOT.
YOU1000000178_S0000049	NOW FOR THE HAYES VALLEY, THIS IS A VERY, VERY TIGHT EXTRACTION, RIGHT?
YOU1000000178_S0000050	20 GRAMS OF COFFEE IN FOR 20 GRAMS OF COFFEE OUT. THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD REFER TO AS A REASONABLY SHORT SHOT.
YOU1000000178_S0000051	BUT WE WANT TO SLOW THAT EXTRACTION PROCESS DOWN, SO WE'RE AIMING FOR ABOUT 30 TO 35 SECONDS OVERALL TIME TO GET IT TO TASTE JUST RIGHT.
YOU1000000178_S0000052	NOW THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IS WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO AFFECT THE FLAVOR.
YOU1000000178_S0000053	A LOW 20 SECOND SHOT IS GOING TO BE A VERY SOUR, UNBALANCED SHOT.
YOU1000000178_S0000054	FOR THE HAZE, WE TEND TO LIKE SOMETHING BETWEEN 30 AND 35 SECONDS TO GET THAT NICE CHOCOLATEY, REALLY CLEAN FLAVOR.
YOU1000000178_S0000055	IF YOU GO A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THAT, SAY 40 SECONDS OR EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT, THE SHOTS CAN START TO TASTE EXCESSIVELY BITTER.
YOU1000000178_S0000057	33 SECONDS, RIGHT IN THE POCKET.
YOU1000000178_S0000058	SO AS YOU CAN SEE, THAT IS A REALLY NICE LOVELY SHOT THAT WE HAVE THERE.
YOU1000000178_S0000059	SO NOW THAT WE'VE GOT A WELL PREPARED SHOT THAT FALLS INTO THE PARAMETERS JUST THE WAY WE WANT, WE'RE GOING TO STEAM UP SOME MILK AND FINISH UP THIS CAPPUCCINO.
YOU1000000178_S0000061	NOW, WHEN YOU'RE STEAMING, YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS STEAM ON TIP THAT HAS A FEW LITTLE HOLES IN IT THAT THAT HOT AIR JETS OUT THROUGH.
YOU1000000178_S0000062	AND YOU WANT TO HAVE IT RIGHT AT THE SURFACE OF THE MILK IN YOUR PITCHER BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO LET IT WHIP IN THE AIR TO CREATE THE TEXTURE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
YOU1000000178_S0000063	ONCE YOU'VE ADDED THE DESIRED AMOUNT OF TEXTURE, YOU'RE GOING TO LIFT THAT PITCHER UP SO THAT IT'S NOT WHIPPING IN ANY MORE AIR, BUT IT'S STILL BRINGING THAT TEMPERATURE UP RIGHT INTO THE ZONE THAT YOU WANT.
YOU1000000178_S0000064	STEAMING IS GOING TO BE REALLY QUICK. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT FIVE TO SIX SECONDS ON THIS MACHINE.
YOU1000000178_S0000065	HOME MACHINES MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER, BUT OVERALL THIS IS ONE OF THOSE EXPERIENCES WHERE MOST PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, YOU BLINK AND IT'S DONE. YOU WONDER WHAT HAPPENED. SO WE HAVE IT ADJUSTED RIGHT THERE. I'VE GOT THAT TIP AT THE SURFACE.
YOU1000000178_S0000067	AND TURN THAT ON.
YOU1000000178_S0000068	YOU HEAR THAT AIR WHIPPING IN? YOU DON'T WANT TO DO TOO MUCH.
YOU1000000178_S0000069	AND THEN
YOU1000000178_S0000071	THAT QUICK. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU WIPE OFF YOUR STEAM WAND AND GIVE IT A LITTLE PURGE AT THE END.
YOU1000000178_S0000072	I'M GONNA GIVE MY ESPRESSO ONE MORE LITTLE SWIRL. A REALLY GREAT THING TO DO AFTER YOU'VE STEAMED YOUR MILK.
YOU1000000178_S0000073	TAP IT.
YOU1000000178_S0000075	ON THE COUNTER.
YOU1000000178_S0000076	AND GIVE IT A NICE SWIRL. WE CALL THAT POLISHING.
YOU1000000178_S0000077	THAT'S GOING TO TAKE WHAT WAS A ROUGHER TEXTURE AND GIVE IT A NICE SHINE. SO IT'S GOT THAT THAT WHITE GOLD, THAT CADILLAC MILK.
YOU1000000178_S0000078	AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO COMBINE THE TWO WITH LATTE ART.
YOU1000000178_S0000079	THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS AND IT TAKES SOME BARISTAS A LIFETIME TO LEARN REALLY WELL.
YOU1000000178_S0000080	SO I'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND DESCRIBE IT TO YOU TOO MUCH I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW IT TO YOU AND ACT LIKE IT'S A MYSTICAL TALENT THAT ONLY PROFESSIONALS CAN DEVELOP
YOU1000000178_S0000082	AFTER YEARS OF PRACTICE.
YOU1000000178_S0000084	AND THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE FINISHED CAPPUCCINO.
YOU1000000178_S0000086	UGH.
YOU1000000178_S0000088	HMM.
YOU1000000179_S0000001	WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THE CONCEPT OF CHARITABLE GIVING TO SEE THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN HELP MAKE AN IMPACT WHILE ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BENEFITS.
YOU1000000179_S0000003	CHARITABLE GIVING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLICATED.
YOU1000000179_S0000004	IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS MAKING DONATIONS TO YOUR CHURCH, ALMA MATER, OR VOLUNTEERING YOUR TIME, LIKE HELPING OUT AT THE LOCAL MISSION.
YOU1000000179_S0000005	GIVING IS MOST FULFILLING WHEN YOU DONATE YOUR MONEY OR TIME TO A CAUSE YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT.
YOU1000000179_S0000006	AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN WE GIVE, IT TRIGGERS THE SAME CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN OUR BRAINS AS FALLING IN LOVE OR BONDING WITH A NEWBORN CHILD.
YOU1000000179_S0000007	BESIDES THE OBVIOUS EMOTIONAL BENEFITS, YOU COULD ALSO END UP SAVING ON TAXES BY GIVING.
YOU1000000179_S0000009	NOW THAT YOU HAVE YOUR MISSION, IT'S TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT GOALS YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH.
YOU1000000179_S0000010	ONCE YOU HAVE SOME IN MIND, PUT TOGETHER AN ACTION PLAN ON PAPER THAT'S FOCUSED ON THE DIFFERENT STEPS YOU'LL TAKE TO CREATE AN IMPACT.
YOU1000000179_S0000012	SOME THINGS YOU CAN INCLUDE IN YOUR PLAN TO HELP YOUR GIVING HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT WOULD BE TO VOLUNTEER NOT JUST MONEY, BUT SKILLS YOU MAY HAVE.
YOU1000000179_S0000013	IT CAN ALSO HELP TO COMMIT TO A CONSISTENT DONATION OVER TIME, AND TO FOCUS ON THE LESS GLAMOROUS BUT ESSENTIAL NEEDS THE CHARITY MAY HAVE.
YOU1000000179_S0000015	THERE ARE OVER 1.8 MILLION NONPROFITS IN THE UNITED STATES, SO YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES.
YOU1000000179_S0000016	MAKE SURE TO EVALUATE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHARE YOUR CAUSE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE STRONG LEADERSHIP, PROCEDURES THAT WILL GUIDE THEIR OPERATIONS, AND WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR ASSISTANCE.
YOU1000000179_S0000018	GIVING CAN BE MORE FUN AND MORE EFFECTIVE BY CONNECTING WITH OTHERS WHO SHARE YOUR GOALS.
YOU1000000179_S0000019	GETTING FAMILY AND FRIENDS INVOLVED HELPS TO ALSO REINFORCE SHARED VALUES AND CREATE STRONGER CONNECTIONS.
YOU1000000179_S0000020	BESIDES BENEFITING THE ORGANIZATIONS OF YOUR CHOICE, YOUR CHARITABLE GIVING CAN ALSO IMPACT YOUR FINANCES.
YOU1000000179_S0000021	IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS YOUR MISSION WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE CHARITABLE GIVING CAN PLAY IN TAX PLANNING.
YOU1000000179_S0000022	TO LEARN MORE ABOUT INCORPORATING CHARITABLE GIVING INTO YOUR OVERALL WEALTH PLANNING, VISIT FIDELITYCHARITABLE.ORG.
YOU1000000180_S0000001	MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY FOR A CEREMONY IN WHICH WE WILL HAVE SWORN IN THE FIRST HEAD OF A NEW AGENCY. I THINK WE HAVE HERE THE BEST MAN FOR THIS NEW JOB THAT WE COULD FIND.
YOU1000000180_S0000003	AND THERE WAS A NECESSITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME TO SHOW THAT IT WAS SERIOUS ABOUT DEALING WITH POLLUTION PROBLEMS.
YOU1000000180_S0000004	THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS WILLING TO STEP IN WHERE OBVIOUSLY THE ALMOST TOTAL DELEGATION OF THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP PRIOR TO 1970 HADN'T GOTTEN THE JOB DONE.
YOU1000000180_S0000006	I CAME IN MID 1973, WAS THE OIL EMBARGO, THE ARAB OIL EMBARGO, AND ENERGY WAS IT.
YOU1000000180_S0000007	AND DURING MY ENTIRE TIME, IT WAS THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY
YOU1000000180_S0000009	CONFLICT, IF YOU WILL, IN TERMS OF POLICY WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION, IN THE CONGRESS, THAT WAS PRETTY CRUCIAL. AND I THINK THE MAJOR EPA ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THOSE YEARS WAS TO KEEP OUR PROGRAMS ON TRACK.
YOU1000000180_S0000011	IN THE AREA OF HEALTH AND SAFETY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE REGULATION. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT BE SENSIBLE AND WELL MANAGED. THE LEGISLATIVE JOB, IN TERMS OF PUTTING BASIC AUTHORITY ON THE BOOKS, IS DONE. WHAT WE NOW NEED IS THE SCIENCE, THE INFORMATION, AND THE FOLLOW THROUGH.
YOU1000000180_S0000012	IF YOU WILL, TO GET THE JOB DONE.
YOU1000000180_S0000014	THE MISSION FOR WHICH THE AGENCY WAS ESTABLISHED IS THE PROTECTION OF THE HEALTH, THE WELFARE, AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS OUR PRIORITY. IT IS A MISSION TO WHICH WE ARE DEDICATED, TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS DEDICATED.
YOU1000000180_S0000016	THE ONE THAT STANDS OUT TO ME WAS CONCLUDING THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL AS A TREATY THAT DEALT WITH AN EXTRAORDINARILY SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE.
YOU1000000180_S0000017	BUT ALSO A TREATY THAT I THINK ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR DEALING WITH INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS.
YOU1000000180_S0000019	THE CLEAN AIR ACT OBVIOUSLY HAS TO STAND VERY HIGH ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT I THINK WE WILL BE PROUD OF AND WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME. IT WAS A TIME WHEN WE
YOU1000000180_S0000021	DEALT WITH VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS. WHEN WE CRAFTED A LAW, A LOT OF THE IDEAS HAD BEEN IN THE AGENCY, WERE CONCEPTUALLY DEVELOPED IN THE AGENCY, THEY WERE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED WITH THE VIEWS OF OTHER AGENCIES AND COORDINATED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU1000000180_S0000023	WHO BETTER THAN YOUR GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT YOUR AIR, YOUR WATER, AND YOUR LAND? IT IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD EXPECT OF ITS GOVERNMENT, THAT WE WOULD DO THESE THINGS.
YOU1000000180_S0000024	FOR YOU. SETTING TOUGH STANDARDS, SETTING STANDARDS THAT PROTECT THE PEOPLE MOST AT RISK, AND THEN ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THOSE STANDARDS ARE MET, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD ON THE INNOVATION AND THE CREATIVITY THAT EXISTS IN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU1000000180_S0000026	WHAT WE DO, THE METHODS WE DISCOVER, THE SOLUTIONS WE COME UP WITH WILL BE PROTOTYPES FOR OTHERS.
YOU1000000180_S0000027	WE WILL LOOK FOR WAYS TO WORK WITH AGRICULTURE AND BUSINESS TO FIND OUT HOW WE CAN REACH OUR SHARED GOALS OF A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT IN WAYS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO SUPPLY US WITH WHAT WE NEED TO ENJOY OUR QUALITY OF LIFE.
YOU1000000180_S0000029	THE JOB IS NEVER DONE. WE HAVE TO GET EVEN BETTER AT IT.
YOU1000000180_S0000030	AND THAT'S BEEN MADE EVEN MORE EVIDENT BY THE FACT THAT WE NOW LIVE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY WHERE OUR COUNTRY IS COMPETING WITH NATIONS THAT AREN'T NEARLY AS ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS AS WE HAVE BECOME.
YOU1000000180_S0000032	OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN CLEANING OUR AIR, WATER AND LAND IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS OUR NATION TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND PROSPER.
YOU1000000180_S0000033	BY EXPANDING THE ROLES OF TECHNOLOGY, COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS, AND FLEXIBLE POLICIES, WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE BROAD INTERESTS AND DELIVER RESULTS QUICKER AND MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN EVER BEFORE TO PROVIDE THE NEXT GENERATION
YOU1000000180_S0000034	A CLEANER, SAFER ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY.
YOU1000000180_S0000036	WE BEGAN BY REAFFIRMING THE CORE VALUES OF THIS AGENCY AND ITS MISSION, AND WE'VE SHOWN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT DEVOTION TO SCIENCE, TO TRANSPARENCY, AND THE LAW ARE PARAMOUNT IN PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT.
YOU1000000180_S0000038	WHILE THE WORLD CONTINUES TO CHANGE, EPA'S MISSION CONTINUES TO ENDURE. OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND TO SAFEGUARD THE PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES THAT WE ALL NEED TO SURVIVE AND TO THRIVE.
YOU1000000180_S0000039	EPA IS HERE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DEMANDED IT. WE WILL BE HERE BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO DEMAND IT. BECAUSE WE STAND BETWEEN POLLUTION AND OUR PEOPLE.
YOU1000000180_S0000041	THOSE THAT WE REGULATE OUGHT TO KNOW WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM.
YOU1000000180_S0000043	SO THAT THEY CAN PLAN AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO COMPLY. AND THE PROCESS THAT WE ENGAGE IN IN ADOPTING REGULATIONS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SENDS A MESSAGE. IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WE TAKE SERIOUSLY.
YOU1000000180_S0000044	OUR ROLE OF TAKING COMMENT AND OFFERING RESPONSE AND THEN MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS ON HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THOSE IN THE MARKETPLACE.
YOU1000000180_S0000046	SINCE THE EARLY 1970S, EPA'S JOB HAS BEEN PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. CLEAN UP AMERICA. AND THE AGENCY HAS DONE JUST THAT.
YOU1000000180_S0000047	WE CAN FOCUS OUR ATTENTION AND RESOURCES ON HELPING COMMUNITIES HELP THEMSELVES.
YOU1000000180_S0000048	DOING THIS WILL STRENGTHEN THIS COUNTRY FROM ITS FOUNDATION UP.
YOU1000000180_S0000049	AND START TO SOLVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF TOMORROW.
YOU1000000180_S0000050	ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS THE FORERUNNER, THE PREREQUISITE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION. IF WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, WE CAN GIVE MANY AMERICANS A MUCH BETTER FUTURE IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS.
YOU1000000181_S0000001	I'M LIVING IN A TAI CHI SCHOOL IN THE WUDANG MOUNTAINS, WHICH IS THE HEART OF TAOISM IN CHINA. AND MY TEACHER IS MASTER GU, WHO'S A TAOIST TAI CHI MASTER.
YOU1000000181_S0000002	SO SOMETIMES IN THE AFTERNOONS WE TALK ABOUT DAOISM, SO HENCE THIS SERIES.
YOU1000000181_S0000003	DAOISM IS AN ANCIENT CHINESE PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION DATING BACK 2,500 YEARS TO THE WRITING OF THE DAODE QING BY LAO TZU.
YOU1000000181_S0000005	YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT AS THE BIBLE FOR TAOISM. NOW THE MAIN THRUST OF TAOISM IS TO FOLLOW THE TAO OR THE PATH OR WAY.
YOU1000000181_S0000006	WELCOME TO WUDANG MOUNTAIN.
YOU1000000181_S0000008	THOUSAND.
YOU1000000181_S0000009	IF YOU OBSERVE THE CHINESE CHARACTER 道 DÀO
YOU1000000181_S0000011	THE FIRST THREE STROKES, THAT'S YIN YAO AND YANG YAO, THAT REPRESENTS THE YIN YANG BALANCE.
YOU1000000181_S0000012	THEN, ZI, WHICH MEANS ONESELF.
YOU1000000181_S0000014	THAT MEANS DAO IS NOT FAR FROM YOU. DAO IS WITHIN YOU.
YOU1000000181_S0000015	THE LAST PART IS ZǑU ZHĪ, WHICH MEANS TO GO, TO MOVE, TO ACT.
YOU1000000181_S0000017	THIS IS A PRETTY POWERFUL IDEA. WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON AN EXTERNAL GOD. THROUGH OUR OWN ACTIONS WE CAN FIND BALANCE.
YOU1000000181_S0000018	NOW THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS GREAT, TELL ME WHAT IS THIS WAY? BUT THE TAO DOESN'T REFER TO A THING, INSTEAD IT'S THE UNDERLYING ORDER THAT GOVERNS THE UNIVERSE.
YOU1000000181_S0000019	SO DEFINING IT IS A FRUITLESS EXERCISE. WHAT IS INSTEAD IS IMPORTANT IS TO BE SENSITIVE TO HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS AND THEN TRY AND LIVE IN HARMONY WITH IT.
YOU1000000181_S0000020	THAT IS WHAT IS MEANT BY FOLLOWING THE TAO AND TAOIST TEACHINGS HAVE MANY GUIDELINES ON HOW TO DO SO.
YOU1000000181_S0000021	I'VE BEEN READING THE TAO TE POO WHICH ARGUES THE CHILDREN'S CHARACTER WINNIE THE POOH IS IN FACT A TAOIST.
YOU1000000181_S0000022	IT'S A REALLY FUN WAY OF GETTING INTO THE TAOIST TEACHINGS AND IF YOU EVER READ WINNIE THE POOH WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER, CHECK OUT THE BOOKS AGAIN. I DID IT RECENTLY. IT'S A REAL NOSTALGIA TRIP.
YOU1000000181_S0000023	IN IT IS A NICE STORY THAT ILLUSTRATES WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DAOIST.
YOU1000000181_S0000024	AROUND A LARGE POT OF VINEGAR CROWD THREE MEN. THESE AREN'T ANY ORDINARY MEN. IN FACT, THEY'RE THE THREE FOUNDERS OF THE GREAT ASIAN PHILOSOPHIES.
YOU1000000181_S0000025	CONFUCIUS, BUDDHA AND LAO TZU.
YOU1000000181_S0000026	EACH TAKES A TASTE OF THE VINEGAR AND FOR CONFUCIUS IT WAS SOUR. THE WORLD WAS FULL OF DEGENERATE PEOPLE AND CORRUPTION AND THE WORLD WAS OUT OF STEP WITH THE WAY OF HEAVEN.
YOU1000000181_S0000027	AS A RESULT THE WORLD WAS SOUR AND WHAT WAS NEEDED WAS RULES AND RITUALS IN ORDER TO RETAIN ORDER.
YOU1000000181_S0000028	BUDDHA THEN TASTED THE VINEGAR AND HE HAD A BITTER EXPRESSION. FOR LIFE WAS BITTER BECAUSE MAN'S WANTS AND DESIRES LED TO MASS SUFFERING.
YOU1000000181_S0000029	AND HAPPINESS COULD ONLY BE FOUND IN LEAVING THIS WORLD AND ENTERING NIRVANA.
YOU1000000181_S0000030	FOR LAO TZU HOWEVER, HE HAD A SMILE ON HIS FACE. FOR A TAOIST, BITTERNESS AND SOUNDNESS ONLY COME FROM THE UNAPPRECIATIVE AND INATTENTIVE MIND.
YOU1000000181_S0000031	I ASKED MASTER GU HOW IT COULD BE POSSIBLE LAO TZU COULD KEEP ON SMILING WHEN TASTING THIS HORRIBLE VINEGAR.
YOU1000000181_S0000032	HUMAN BEINGS COME FROM NATURE. WE MUST FOLLOW NATURE'S PATH.
YOU1000000181_S0000033	NATURE ITSELF, THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT SOUR OR BITTER.
YOU1000000181_S0000034	IN NATURE, THE COSMOS, THERE IS ITS OWN NATURAL RHYTHM PATH.
YOU1000000181_S0000035	NEVER TO BE TOO FAST, NOT TOO SLOW. THERE IS, YOU KNOW, HE HAS HIS RHYTHM, HIS PACE. WE HUMAN BEINGS ALSO MUST FIND
YOU1000000181_S0000036	FIND IT, RECOGNIZE IT, AND FOLLOW THIS HEAVENLY WAY.
YOU1000000181_S0000037	SO IT ONLY DEPENDS ON YOU, ERWIN.
YOU1000000181_S0000039	ATTITUDE TO LIFE.
YOU1000000181_S0000040	AS THE SAYING GOES, IF YOU'RE FROZEN, LIFE IS LIKE A MIRROR. YOU'RE FROZEN, THE MIRROR FROZE AT YOU. YOU SMILE, THE MIRROR SMILES AT YOU. THAT IS LIFE.
YOU1000000181_S0000041	A TYPICAL DOLL IS NEVER RICH, IN THEIR SENSE, BECAUSE THEY ARE MIXED WITH THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS BOUNDLESS.
YOU1000000181_S0000042	SO THAT'S WHY THEY ARE VERY CONSENTED ABOUT LIFE AND WEAR A SMILE.
YOU1000000181_S0000044	WOULDN'T THAT BE AWESOME TO BE ABLE TO KEEP ON SMILING WHEN LIFE SOMETIMES TURNS SOUR?
YOU1000000181_S0000045	AND THAT'S THE PROSPECT THAT TAOIST PHILOSOPHY OFFERS US. IT'S A SET OF GUIDELINES FOR LIVING A CONTENTED AND HAPPY LIFE.
YOU1000000181_S0000046	AS MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW I STARTED THIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL AFTER FINISHING UNIVERSITY. I FOUND THE TIME QUITE DIFFICULT, I FOUND MY MOOD TO BE VARIABLE.
YOU1000000181_S0000047	AND MY BRAIN WAS JUST OVERACTIVE. SO IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOUR BRAIN'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO ACTIVE OR IF YOU'VE HAD DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY OR IF YOU'RE LIKE ANYONE AND YOU JUST WANT TO LIVE A CONTENTED LIFE
YOU1000000181_S0000048	THEN MY ROLE IN THESE VIDEOS IS TO SEE HOW WE CAN APPLY TAOIST PHILOSOPHY TO OUR OWN LIVES. I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE ME BORING YOU EACH WEEK, I'D LOVE THIS TO BE A TWO WAY DIALOGUE
YOU1000000181_S0000049	WHERE YOU GUYS TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPTS, AS WELL AS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ISSUES THAT ARE PERSONALLY BOTHERING YOU. MASTER GU AND I CAN SEE IF TAOIST PHILOSOPHY CAN HELP YOU.
YOU1000000181_S0000050	IF YOU PREFER TO KEEP THAT PRIVATE THEN OF COURSE YOU CAN MESSAGE ME ON INSTAGRAM OR FACEBOOK BUT IT WOULD ALSO BE AWESOME TO START A YOUTUBE DISCUSSION AS WELL BECAUSE THEN YOU GUYS CAN HELP EACH OTHER OUT.
YOU1000000181_S0000051	MASTER GU EMBODIES WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A TAOIST. HE'S A JOYOUS MAN. HE LAUGHS AND SMILES A LOT.
YOU1000000181_S0000052	I'M NOT A SELLING CLOTH.
YOU1000000181_S0000054	AND DESPITE BEING 50 PLUS HE'S FULL OF ENERGY.
YOU1000000181_S0000058	SO I'M EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE TEACHINGS THAT ARE IN PART RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE WONDERFUL QUALITIES.
YOU1000000181_S0000060	AND THE FIRST QUESTION FOR THIS WEEK IS WHAT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR IMPRESSIONS OF DAOISM IS TODAY. DO YOU GUYS KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT? I'M ALSO STARTING FROM ALMOST ZERO SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH OF US.
YOU1000000181_S0000061	OKAY, THAT'S IT GUYS. THANKS FOR WATCHING.
YOU1000000183_S0000000	ONE THING YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY OF ALL THESE PUBLIC COMPANIES OUT THERE, HERE'S THE COMPANY I REALLY LIKE. THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE TERRIFIC, THEIR EARNINGS ARE DOING WELL, THEIR COMPETITORS ARE DOING POORLY.
YOU1000000183_S0000001	I THINK THIS COMPANY IS DOING TERRIFIC AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STOCK MIGHT HAVE GONE FROM 40 TO 30 BECAUSE OF THIS DECLINE. THAT WOULD SAY, WOW, HERE'S A CHANCE TO BUY IT.
YOU1000000183_S0000002	SO YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY SOME COMPANIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERPRICED AT 60 AND ALL THEY DID WAS GO TO 50 AND SAY BIG DEAL. SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND COMPANIES YOU LIKED ANYWAY. RIGHT NOW YOU LIKE THEM AND NOW THEY'VE HAD A HAIRCUT.
YOU1000000183_S0000003	THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO. NOT A STOCK THAT WENT FROM OVERPRICED TO FAIRLY PRICED. SOME OF THOSE FAIRLY PRICED AT THE START OF THIS EXERCISE AND THEN HAD A VERY, YOU KNOW, A FIVE FOR FOUR SALE.
YOU1000000183_S0000005	HEY, GUYS. WELCOME BACK TO THE CHANNEL. IN THIS VIDEO, WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME INVESTING LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM PETER LYNCH.
YOU1000000183_S0000006	THAT WE CAN APPLY FOR OUR OWN INVESTING IN 2021.
YOU1000000183_S0000007	SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT AN INTERVIEW FROM WAY BACK IN 1997, A CHARLIE ROSE INTERVIEW THAT PETER LYNCH DID. AND I DO HAVE TO SAY APOLOGIES.
YOU1000000183_S0000008	SOME OF THE CUTS IN THIS INTERVIEW ARE GOING TO BE QUITE ABRUPT. IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND, LIKE CHARLIE ROSE, HE JUST INTERRUPTS PETER ALL THE TIME IN THIS INTERVIEW.
YOU1000000183_S0000009	SO I APOLOGIZE, I'VE TRIED TO DO THE BEST I CAN TO GET TO THE MEAT OF THE ARGUMENT, BECAUSE I THINK THE WHOLE INTERVIEW IS ABOUT 25 MINUTES. SO I'VE TRIED TO CHOP IT DOWN INTO THE BEST BITS.
YOU1000000183_S0000010	SO WITH THAT SAID, LET'S GET STUCK INTO IT.
YOU1000000183_S0000011	GLAD TO BE HERE.
YOU1000000183_S0000012	EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
YOU1000000183_S0000013	WELL, WE HAD A HUGE RUN. I MEAN, THE MARKET WAS $4,000 JUST, YOU KNOW, TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO. AND IT RAN UP TO $8,300 IN AUGUST.
YOU1000000183_S0000014	AND YOU KNOW, LIKE ANY BIG RALLY, SOMETIMES IT BACKS OFF. I MEAN, IT'S HEALTHY.
YOU1000000183_S0000015	EVERYTHING IS OVERPRICED.
YOU1000000183_S0000016	YEAH, AND THAT DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING. THE MARKET SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS SOLD BETWEEN 10 TIMES EARNINGS AND 20 TIMES EARNINGS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOW JONES OR THE S&P 500, YOU ADD UP ALL THE COMPANIES AND TAKE THE EARNINGS.
YOU1000000183_S0000017	YOU SEE, THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP. AND IT FOLLOWS. MCDONALD'S EARNINGS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC THE LAST 30 YEARS, AND THE STOCK'S BEEN TERRIFIC. THERE'S A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. SO THE EARNINGS OF THE S&P 500 HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THIS RANGE OF 10 AND 20.
YOU1000000183_S0000018	WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO GO OVER THE 20, WHICH IS THE HIGH END OF THE P RANGE. THERE WASN'T A LOT OF
YOU1000000183_S0000019	SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE TO IS IS IT THAT THE TOP OF HIGH HIGH IT SHOULD EVER BE
YOU1000000183_S0000020	RIGHT. IT'S BEEN OVER THERE ONLY A FEW TIMES EVER OVER 20 AND THAT'S WHEN USUALLY INFLATION IS ABOUT ZERO.
YOU1000000183_S0000021	SO THIS CLIP KIND OF JUST SETS THE SCENE BECAUSE WHAT PETER LYNCH IS DESCRIBING IN THIS CLIP IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE SEE TODAY. HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW THE P RATIO OF THE MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000022	GENERALLY SITS BETWEEN 10 AND 20, WITH 20 REALLY BEING THAT UPPER END. WELL, NOW THESE DAYS WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT THE ULTRA UPPER END OF THAT NUMBER LOOKS LIKE.
YOU1000000183_S0000023	AND IT SEEMS TO BE
YOU1000000183_S0000025	ABOUT 30. NOW THAT'S KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE WHAT WE CURRENTLY SEE IS A PE RATIO FOR THE MARKET AT 35.
YOU1000000183_S0000026	IT'S ONLY BEEN OVER 30 IN THREE TIMES IN HISTORY 1929 1999 AND RIGHT NOW
YOU1000000183_S0000027	SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE MARKET IS CERTAINLY HOT, JUST LIKE THE MARKET WAS HOT BACK WHEN PETER LYNCH DID THIS INTERVIEW.
YOU1000000183_S0000028	BACK IN 1997 BUT THE QUESTION WE'VE GOT TO ASK OURSELVES IS WELL HOW DO WE GO ABOUT OUR INVESTING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?
YOU1000000183_S0000029	THE DECLINE YESTERDAY IN A SENSE IT LET OFF SOME OF THIS OVERVALUATION THE MARKET WAS EVEN OVERVALUED WHERE IT WAS AND BY LETTING IT OFF THEN WE GOT BACK TO WHAT WAS REASONABLE
YOU1000000183_S0000030	YEAH, I WOULD SAY FAIRLY PRICED. MAYBE FOR THE LARGER COMPANIES THEY'RE NOW OKAY. THERE MIGHT BE SOME SMALL COMPANIES. WE'VE HAD 3,000 COMPANIES COME PUBLIC THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THAT'S TWO A BUSINESS DAY.
YOU1000000183_S0000031	SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES HAVE GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY AND THAT'S SORT OF A RESEARCH ZONE THAT AVERAGE PEOPLE IN THE STOCK SHOP, THAT WE CAN FIND. SOME PEOPLE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS, 10,000 PUBLIC COMPANIES.
YOU1000000183_S0000032	A LOT OF THEM ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE AND NO ONE'S FOLLOWING THEM. AND THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE FOLLOWING IBM.
YOU1000000183_S0000034	COMPANIES THAT NOBODY ELSE FOLLOWED.
YOU1000000183_S0000035	RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO GO TO SEE COMPANIES WITH UNIONS OR COMPANIES IN TROUBLE OR COMPANIES THAT NO ONE LOOKS AT.
YOU1000000183_S0000036	THAT HAD NIGHT THAT'S NOT
YOU1000000183_S0000037	YEAH, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT A LOT OF THEM.
YOU1000000183_S0000038	YOU KNOW KENNEL IS YOUR WIFE OR THAT IS STILL OUT
YOU1000000183_S0000039	YOU'VE GOT PIER 1 IMPORTS, MY WIFE FOUND THAT ONE TOO. BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT 20 TO FIND ONE. IT'S JUST YOU DON'T GO TO THE MALL AND FIND THE STOCK. I MEAN YOU HAVE TO SAY, MY GOD THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOOD. THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME STEPS. YOU HAVE TO DO AN ORGANIZED METHOD.
YOU1000000183_S0000040	NOW THAT METHOD WE'LL GET TO IN A SECOND BUT IN THIS CLIP PETER INADVERTENTLY DESCRIBES EXACTLY HOW WE SHOULD BE APPROACHING OUR INVESTING RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000183_S0000041	BECAUSE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE MARKET IS REALLY HIGH, WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ACTUALLY A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE GOING DOWN.
YOU1000000183_S0000042	AND WHAT WE SEE IS THAT AN INDEX LIKE THE S&P 500 IS ACTUALLY PROPPED UP
YOU1000000183_S0000043	BY LITERALLY FIVE TO TEN REALLY HIGH PERFORMING MASSIVE BEHEMOTH COMPANIES.
YOU1000000183_S0000044	NOW, WHAT PETER'S TELLING US IN THIS CLIP IS TO BE A GREAT INVESTOR, EVEN WHEN THE MARKET'S REALLY OVERVALUED, YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM LOOKING AT JUST THOSE MASSIVE BEHEMOTH COMPANIES.
YOU1000000183_S0000045	EVERYBODY'S FOLLOWING THESE BIG COMPANIES. EVERYONE'S INVESTING IN THEM. AND THE PRICES FOR THESE BIG COMPANIES ARE ALL SKY HIGH.
YOU1000000183_S0000046	SO WE SHOULD BE BROADENING OUR HORIZONS AND LOOKING MAYBE AT THE COMPANIES THAT COME AFTER THE 50TH LARGEST STOCK IN THE S&P 500.
YOU1000000183_S0000047	OR MAYBE BEYOND THE 20TH LARGEST STOCK IN THE ASX200 BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY GOING TO FIND VALUE.
YOU1000000183_S0000048	AND THEN THE OTHER SECRET IS THAT OF COURSE YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT A LOT OF BUSINESSES.
YOU1000000183_S0000049	THE BEST INVESTORS ARE THE ONES THAT TURN OVER THE MOST STONES, RIGHT? AS PETER LYNCH SAID IN THIS INTERVIEW, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT 20 TO FIND ONE.
YOU1000000183_S0000050	ALRIGHT, WITH THAT SAID, NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL STEPS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE TAKING TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENT.
YOU1000000183_S0000051	THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME STEPS. YOU HAVE TO DO AN ORGANIZED METHOD. PEOPLE ARE CAREFUL WHEN THEY BUY A TOASTER.
YOU1000000183_S0000053	CAREFUL THEY'RE CAREFUL THEY DO THEY DO SOME RESEARCH
YOU1000000183_S0000054	BUT THEY DON'T DO IT WITH STOCK. THEY CALL UP THE BROKER, THEY SEE SOMEBODY AT LUNCH AND THEY SAY, MAN I GOT THIS HOT STOCK AND YOU RUN RIGHT OUT AND YOU SPEND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS, SMALL INVESTORS.
YOU1000000183_S0000055	YEAH. EVEN WORSE, THEY PUT AN OPTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL DATA WACC. THEY DON'T EVEN OWN INTERNATIONAL DATA WACC. THEY HAVE A 90 DAY CLAIM.
YOU1000000183_S0000056	BUT IT WAS A GOOD IN THE MAKE A LOT OF MY YET
YOU1000000183_S0000057	AND IT'S LIKE A CASINO. SO IT'S LIKE A CASINO, YOU GET THE SAME RESULTS, EXCEPT THERE'S MORE PAPERWORK.
YOU1000000183_S0000058	SO THIS MORNING YOU GET UP AND YOU GO IN AND YOU LOOK AT AT THOSE COMPANIES THAT THAT YOU
YOU1000000183_S0000059	THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ITCH. LET'S SAY THE CEMENT INDUSTRY GOES FROM CRUMMY TO SEMI CRUMMY TO FAIRLY GOOD. THE STOCKS ARE GOING NORTH.
YOU1000000183_S0000060	YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY. THAT'S THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW. WHAT IF YOU KNOW THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY? YOU HAVE AN EDGE. YOU WORK. I MEAN, WHAT IF YOU LAST 30 YEARS?
YOU1000000183_S0000061	YOU WORK IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN TACO BELL, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN SAMBARRO'S, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN PIZZA HUT, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN CHILI'S, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THESE COMPANIES DOING VERY WELL. YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THOSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BUY BIOTECHNOLOGY STOCKS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.
YOU1000000183_S0000062	I MEAN, I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT LOCAL AREA NETWORKING. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BUYING THE CISCO. THEY'RE BUYING THE EQUIPMENT, SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO ROOT TOGETHER ALL THESE PERIPHERALS AND PUT TOGETHER THE SERVERS.
YOU1000000183_S0000063	BUT BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD BY THE WAY ON A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR MARKET
YOU1000000183_S0000064	YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT WAS THEIR SAYING, ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAD THAT. MY GOD, IF IT WORKS FOR US, OTHER PEOPLE WILL TRY IT, THEN COLLEGES WILL TRY IT, HIGH SCHOOLS WILL TRY IT, THEN THEY'LL GO OVERSEAS. THEY KNEW THEY WERE EARLY IN THE BALLGAME.
YOU1000000183_S0000065	AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUYING THAT COMPANY INSTEAD OF OUT BUYING SOMETHING THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT, SOME OIL DRILLING COMPANY. I MEAN, PEOPLE HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO ALWAYS BUY SOMETHING THEY DON'T.
YOU1000000183_S0000066	ALL YOU NEED IS A FEW GOOD STOCKS.
YOU1000000183_S0000067	THIS IS YOUR SONG. THIS HAS BEEN YOUR SONG FOR A LONG TIME. ONLY BY WHAT YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000183_S0000068	NO, BUT PEOPLE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY THERE'S 5,000 COMPANIES OUT THERE, WHICH ONE SHOULD I BUY? THE AVERAGE PERSON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW FOUR OR FIVE COMPANIES. THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO LECTURE ON THEM. THEY UNDERSTAND THE COMPANIES.
YOU1000000183_S0000069	AND THIS FORCES YOU, THIS TOOL SAYS TO YOU RIGHT DOWN THE...
YOU1000000183_S0000070	ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU KEEP SAYING THIS.
YOU1000000183_S0000071	SO THAT MAKES SENSE, YOU HAVE TO START WITH OBVIOUSLY GOING AHEAD AND DOING SOME RESEARCH. YOU KNOW, HE SAYS PEOPLE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH WHEN THEY GO TO BUY A TOASTER.
YOU1000000183_S0000072	WHY ISN'T IT THAT PEOPLE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH WHEN THEY GO TO BUY A STOCK? DON'T TREAT THE STOCK MARKET LIKE A CASINO.
YOU1000000183_S0000073	AND THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO SIT DOWN TO LEARN ABOUT SOME COMPANIES, LOOK AT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY RELEVANT TO YOU.
YOU1000000183_S0000074	WARREN BUFFETT WOULD USE THE PHRASE STICK WITHIN YOUR CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE. PETER LYNCH'S EXAMPLE HERE IS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT WORKS IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY,
YOU1000000183_S0000075	LOOK AT PIZZA HUT, LOOK AT TACO BELL. THEY'RE COMPANIES THAT YOU PROBABLY ALREADY UNDERSTAND TO QUITE A HIGH LEVEL.
YOU1000000183_S0000076	AND DON'T GO MESSING AROUND WITH THESE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS SO ONCE YOU FIND THOSE COMPANIES THAT RESONATE WITH YOU, THEN YOU GO IN, YOU DO THAT RESEARCH
YOU1000000183_S0000077	AND AS PETER LYNCH SAYS, YOU ONLY NEED FOUR TO FIVE GOOD STOCKS IN LIKE A DECADE. WARREN BUFFETT WOULD ARGUE YOU NEED EVEN LESS THAN THAT.
YOU1000000183_S0000078	BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THOSE COMPANIES WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A LECTURE ON THEIR BUSINESS.
YOU1000000183_S0000079	SO THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST STEP. FIRST STEP IS TO STAY WITHIN YOUR KIND OF CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE. SECOND STEP, GO IN AND UNDERSTAND THOSE BUSINESSES IN DEPTH.
YOU1000000183_S0000080	AND THEN AFTER THAT, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? WELL, LET'S LISTEN IN.
YOU1000000183_S0000081	ONE THING YOU TRY TO DO IS SAY, OF ALL THESE PUBLIC COMPANIES OUT THERE, HERE'S A COMPANY I REALLY LIKE. THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE TERRIFIC, THEIR EARNINGS ARE DOING WELL, THEIR COMPETITORS ARE DOING POORLY.
YOU1000000183_S0000082	I THINK THIS COMPANY IS DOING TERRIFIC AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STOCK MIGHT HAVE GONE FROM 40 TO 30 BECAUSE OF THIS DECLINE. THAT WOULD SAY, WOW, HERE'S A CHANCE TO BUY IT.
YOU1000000183_S0000083	SO YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY SOME COMPANIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERPRICED AT 60 AND ALL THEY DID WAS GO TO 50 AND SAY BIG DEAL. SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND COMPANIES YOU LIKED ANYWAY.
YOU1000000183_S0000084	RIGHT NOW YOU LIKE THEM AND NOW THEY'VE HAD A HAIRCUT. THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO. NOT A SLIGHT ONE FROM OVERPRICED TO FAIRLY PRICED. SEND IT TO A FAIRLY PRICED AT THE START OF THIS EXERCISE.
YOU1000000183_S0000085	AND THEN HAD A VERY, YOU KNOW, A FIVE FOR FOUR SALE.
YOU1000000183_S0000086	IF YOU HAD BEEN MANAGING THE MAGELLAN FUND THIS MORNING, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BUYING LIKE CRAZY?
YOU1000000183_S0000087	I WOULD HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING LIKE CRAZY. I WOULD HAVE BEEN SAYING, WHICH COMPANIES ARE THE SAME STORY? IS THERE ANYTHING REALLY HAPPENING? THIS IS A NON EVENT FOR THEM. THEY'RE STILL DOING WELL. EVEN IF WE HAVE A RECESSION.
YOU1000000183_S0000088	IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF KINDS I'M TRYING TO BUY. BUT LET'S SAY IF A COMPANY, JUST THINK OF THIS AS BEING, YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, I THINK THIS COMPANY IS GOING TO EARN SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE.
YOU1000000183_S0000089	IT'S ALREADY DISCOUNTED AT THE TIME A HUGE MULTIPLE YOU SAY IT'S ALREADY HAS TO WORK AND THAT'S ONLY MISLEAD
YOU1000000183_S0000090	SO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO YOURSELF, IF I'M RIGHT, HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO MAKE? IF I'M WRONG, HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO LOSE? THAT'S THE RISK REWARD RATIO. IN STOCK SHOP, WE TALK ABOUT, IF I'M RIGHT, I HOPE I'M GOING TO DOUBLE TRIP MY MONEY. IF I'M WRONG,
YOU1000000183_S0000091	MAY ALL LOSE 30 40%. THAT'S A FAVOR RATIO. WE SAY IF I'M RIGHT, THE STOCK'S NOT GOING TO GO UP. IT'S ALREADY DISCOUNTING TERRIFIC THINGS. IF DISCOUNTING TERRIFIC THINGS ARE ALREADY IN THE STOCK, I DON'T WANT TO OWN IT.
YOU1000000183_S0000092	SO FIRST STEP IS TO FIND A COMPANY WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE EDGE. THE SECOND STEP IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS, UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIALS, UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS.
YOU1000000183_S0000093	BUT THEN WHAT PETER LYNCH TALKS ABOUT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE BASICALLY EVERYTHING'S OVERVALUED, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND FIND COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST FAIRLY VALUED.
YOU1000000183_S0000094	EVEN IN THIS EXTREME OVERVALUED ENVIRONMENT. BECAUSE AS INVESTORS WHAT WE DO IS WE BUY UNDERVALUED STOCKS, RIGHT? WE ALWAYS BUY AT A DISCOUNT TO INTRINSIC VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000095	AND THAT'S HOW WE KNOW WE MAKE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. NOW IF YOU FIND A COMPANY THAT'S REALLY GREAT, BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY EXPENSIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT,
YOU1000000183_S0000096	AND THEN THERE'S SOME SORT OF 10 15% MARKET DIP AND IT BRINGS THE STOCK BACK DOWN TO FAIR VALUE. WELL THEN REMEMBER, IT'S STILL LIKE PAYING
YOU1000000183_S0000097	FULL RETAIL FOR THAT STOCK. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS GREAT BUSINESSES THAT IN THIS OVERVALUED ENVIRONMENT ARE JUST FAIRLY VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000098	SO IF ANYTHING DOES HAPPEN SUDDENLY IN THE MARKET, SOMETHING CAUSES A 10% DIP OR A 15% DIP, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT BUSINESS GOES FROM BEING A FAIR VALUE
YOU1000000183_S0000099	TO NOW BEING UNDERVALUED. SO THEY'RE THE KIND OF SITUATIONS WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IMAGINE THIS, THE NEW XBOX ONE X CONSOLE, FULL RETAIL
YOU1000000183_S0000100	PRICE I THINK IS 750 AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. IF YOU WENT INTO SAY
YOU1000000183_S0000102	EB GAMES AND THEY WERE SELLING THAT XBOX FOR YOU KNOW, IT WAS $1,000 AND NOW IT'S DROPPED DOWN TO $750.
YOU1000000183_S0000103	YOU'RE NOT GETTING EXCITED BY THAT DEAL BECAUSE IT'S JUST COME BACK DOWN TO FULL PRICE. BUT IF THAT SAME STORE WAS OFFERING, YOU KNOW, IT STARTED AT $750, FULL RETAIL
YOU1000000183_S0000104	AND THEN IT DROPPED DOWN TO 500 WELL OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A MUCH BETTER DEAL. EXACTLY THE SAME THING WITH BUSINESSES IN THE STOCK MARKET.
YOU1000000183_S0000105	AND JUST QUICKLY, THE OTHER THING TO NOTE FROM WHAT PETER LYNCH SAID IN THIS LITTLE CLIP WAS WHEN HE SAID IF A STOCK IS TRADING AT A HUGE MULTIPLE, IT BASICALLY HAS TO WORK.
YOU1000000183_S0000106	RIGHT? AND IF IT DOES WORK OUT, THEN YOU'RE STILL JUST EVEN. NOW, EVEN TODAY, WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SOME COMPANIES, THEY MIGHT BE GREAT COMPANIES, BUT THEY'RE TRADING AT P RATIOS IN THE HUNDREDS,
YOU1000000183_S0000107	IF NOT LITERALLY THE THOUSANDS LIKE SOME COMPANIES FOR INSTANCE LIKE TESLA I THINK HAS A P RATIO OF 1300
YOU1000000183_S0000108	NOW, WHAT THIS MEANS IS IT MEANS THAT THE PRICE THAT INVESTORS ARE PAYING TODAY, THIS IS ALREADY, THEY ARE EXPECTING FLAWLESS, CONTINUED GROWTH
YOU1000000183_S0000109	FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS TO COME. THAT'S WHAT THE SHARE PRICE IS TELLING US. NOW, IF YOU INVEST IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS AT THESE PRICES,
YOU1000000183_S0000110	THEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR UPSIDE AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF ROOM FOR DOWNSIDE BECAUSE INVESTORS RIGHT NOW ARE ALREADY EXPECTING YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF PERFECTION.
YOU1000000183_S0000111	RIGHT, OF ABSOLUTELY PERFECT EXECUTION. AS PETER LYNCH SAYS, YOU HAVE TO FACTOR IN IF I'M RIGHT, HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO MAKE?
YOU1000000183_S0000112	AND IF I'M WRONG, HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO LOSE? AND THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE BUYING INTO A STOCK.
YOU1000000183_S0000113	AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DISCOUNTED CASHFLOW ANALYSIS AND YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH RATES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT RISK RATIO IS FOR THE COMPANY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.
YOU1000000183_S0000114	WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO PEOPLE TODAY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MARKET OVER THE NEAR TERM IS WHAT? WHAT'S YOUR FEELING?
YOU1000000183_S0000115	WE CAN TAKE A LOOK BY BUSINESS WE CAN TAKE A COIN OUT AND FLIP IT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE NEXT THOUSAND POINTS
YOU1000000183_S0000116	THE NEXT 6,000 POINTS CAN BE UP. THE NEXT 14,000 POINTS CAN BE UP. THE NEXT 20,000 POINTS CAN BE UP.
YOU1000000183_S0000117	BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT THOUSAND IS GOING TO BE.
YOU1000000183_S0000118	NOBODY HAS TO BE A NOBODY DOES
YOU1000000183_S0000119	AND IT'S FUTILE TO TRY AND GUESS IT. CORPORATE PROFITS WILL BE A LOT HIGHER 10 YEARS FROM NOW, IT'LL BE A LOT HIGHER 20 YEARS FROM NOW. THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN RELY ON.
YOU1000000183_S0000120	THE THIRD KEY STEP THAT PETER LYNCH HIGHLIGHTS IN THIS CLIP IS TO ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM.
YOU1000000183_S0000121	DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE MARKET WILL DO NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH OR EVEN NEXT YEAR. WHAT YOU SHOULD BE REALLY FOCUSED ON IS WHAT IS THIS COMPANY GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.
YOU1000000183_S0000122	IN 10 YEARS FROM NOW. ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM BECAUSE IF YOU CAN DO THAT THEN SHORT TERM MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, THEY REALLY DON'T MATTER.
YOU1000000183_S0000123	AND YOU JUST DON'T STRESS ABOUT THEM AT ALL. IN FACT, WHEN PRICES GO DOWN, YOU GET EXCITED, YOU DON'T GET SCARED.
YOU1000000183_S0000124	AS PETER LYNCH SAYS, YOU KNOW, CORPORATE PROFITS WILL BE A LOT HIGHER IN 10 YEARS FROM NOW. THEY'LL BE A LOT HIGHER IN 20 YEARS FROM NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO RELY ON.
YOU1000000183_S0000125	WE RELY ON THE FACT THAT YES, BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE, MAYBE NOT OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE SAW WITH THE LOCKDOWN WHERE BUSINESSES IMPAIRED FOR LIKE A WHOLE YEAR OR TWO.
YOU1000000183_S0000126	IT STILL DOESN'T MATTER TO US BECAUSE WE LOOK FOR SITUATIONS WHERE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER FIVE YEARS, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER TEN YEARS?
YOU1000000183_S0000127	AND IF THAT SITUATION IS FAVORABLE THAT'S WHEN WE INVEST.
YOU1000000183_S0000128	WHAT ABOUT ALL THE CRITICISM OF DERIVATIVES AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE HAD?
YOU1000000183_S0000129	THAT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED FOR ME.
YOU1000000183_S0000130	ALL I KNOW IS, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. IT'S COMPLICATED FOR YOU? IT'S WAY OVER MY HEAD. I'VE NEVER BOUGHT AN OPTION IN MY LIFE. I NEVER BOUGHT A... TIME'S ON YOUR SIDE WHEN YOU OWN A STOCK. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PUTTING, YOU KNOW, 3% DOWN AND BUYING A FUTURE IN A STRAP AND A STRADDLE. THAT'S WAY OVER MY HEAD.
YOU1000000183_S0000132	ALL RIGHT SO YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY EARNINGS POTENTIAL FOR MOST WELL RUN COMPANIES WILL DO ALL RIGHT
YOU1000000183_S0000133	BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE'VE HAD NINE RECESSIONS SINCE WORLD WAR II.
YOU1000000183_S0000134	WE'LL HAVE OTHER RECESSIONS.
YOU1000000183_S0000135	NOT IN ONE NAIL.
YOU1000000183_S0000136	BUT WE MAY HAVE ONE IN THE FUTURE AND DON'T GET WORRIED ABOUT IT. WE'LL HAVE ONE. SOMETIME IT'LL HAPPEN AND NO ONE WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
YOU1000000183_S0000137	WELL, WON'T THE FUNDAMENTALS TELL YOU?
YOU1000000183_S0000138	NO, YOU'LL FIND OUT AFTER THE FACT. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'LL NOTICE ORDERS SLOWING, PRICES GET MORE COMPETITIVE, THEN EARNINGS ARE DOWN. USUALLY YOU FIND OUT AFTER THE FACT. EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RECESSION FOR FIVE YEARS, IT JUST HASN'T HAPPENED.
YOU1000000183_S0000139	IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. I HOPE YOU'LL COME BACK ANYTIME, PETER.
YOU1000000183_S0000140	YOU KNOW, I REALLY LIKE THIS LAST CLIP FROM PETER LYNCH. IT'S JUST A LESSON YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET TOO FANCY, RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIFT INTO THINGS THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. LIKE A LOT OF STOCK INVESTORS,
YOU1000000183_S0000141	THEY ARE JUST ALL OVER OPTIONS. PETER LYNCH IS THE FIRST TO PUT HIS HAND UP AND SAYS, LOOK, I LOVE INVESTING IN COMPANIES. I DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN IT COMES TO OPTIONS. NEVER BOUGHT AN OPTION IN MY LIFE.
YOU1000000183_S0000142	SO, YOU KNOW, STEP ONE, FIND THE BUSINESSES YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU1000000183_S0000143	STEP TWO, YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU'RE LOOKING AT FAIRLY VALUED BUSINESSES THAT CAN GO UNDERVALUED
YOU1000000183_S0000144	STEP THREE, FOCUS ON THE LONG RUN, FIND SOLID BUSINESSES WITH LOW DEBTS, HIGH CASH FLOWS, AND JUST KEEP FOCUSED ON THAT STUFF BECAUSE THAT'S THE WINNING FORMULA, YOU KNOW.
YOU1000000183_S0000145	WE ARE GOING TO SEE RECESSIONS IN THE FUTURE. WE'VE SEEN RECESSIONS IN THE PAST. IT COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW. IT COULD HAPPEN NEXT WEEK. IT COULD HAPPEN IN A YEAR'S TIME OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.
YOU1000000183_S0000146	BUT THE MAIN THING IS THAT STRONG COMPANIES WITH SOLID CASH FLOWS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
YOU1000000183_S0000147	THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH AND THEY'RE THE ONES WE SHOULD BE ULTRA FOCUSED ON IN ANY STOCK MARKET ENVIRONMENT. SO
YOU1000000183_S0000148	ANYWAY GUYS, I HOPE THAT YOU ENJOYED THIS VIDEO. I ALWAYS LIKE LISTENING TO WHAT PETER LYNCH HAS TO SAY, EVEN IN THESE REALLY, REALLY OLD INTERVIEWS LIKE THIS FROM 1997 AND YET
YOU1000000183_S0000150	JUST BECAUSE MARKET WAS HIGH THEN, MARKET'S HIGH NOW, EVERYTHING THAT HE'S SAYING IS ALMOST DIRECTLY APPLICABLE INTO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR INVESTING TODAY.
YOU1000000183_S0000151	AND I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT WHEN WE CAN DRAW THOSE KIND OF PARALLELS. IT'S LIKE POETRY.
YOU1000000183_S0000153	ANYWAY GUYS, HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE VIDEO.
YOU1000000183_S0000154	LEAVE A LIKE ON IT IF YOU DID, SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO ALREADY.
YOU1000000183_S0000155	AND MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT PROFITFUL. LINKS ARE DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT HOW I GO ABOUT MY INVESTING, IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT
YOU1000000183_S0000156	YOU KNOW, A LOT OF KEY POINTS IN PETER LYNCH'S STRATEGY IN MUCH MORE DETAIL AND KIND OF LIKE STEP BY STEP.
YOU1000000183_S0000157	THEN FEEL FREE TO CHECK OUT INTRODUCTION TO STOCK ANALYSIS. BUT THAT'LL DO ME FOR TODAY GUYS. THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING AND I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN THE NEXT VIDEO.
YOU1000000184_S0000001	I'M BOB KLEIN FROM LOS ANGELES. I WONDER IF YOU COULD GIVE US A GLIMPSE INTO YOUR INVESTMENT PROCESS, THE WAY YOU APPROACH LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD USE REAL ESTATE AS AN EXAMPLE.
YOU1000000184_S0000002	I KNOW REAL ESTATE HASN'T BEEN A BIG, HUGE PART OF BERKSHIRE'S PORTFOLIO OVER THE YEARS, AND I WONDER IF THAT'S BECAUSE YOU VIEW REAL ESTATE AS A COMMODITY BUSINESS.
YOU1000000184_S0000003	OR MAYBE THE CASH FLOWS FROM REAL ESTATE TEND TO BE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN PERHAPS FROM SOME OTHER INDUSTRIES.
YOU1000000184_S0000005	IT TENDS TO BE LESS LIKELY TO BE MISPRICED AND THEREFORE LESS LIKELY TO FIND TERRIFIC BARGAINS IN REAL ESTATE.
YOU1000000184_S0000006	SO.
YOU1000000184_S0000007	GO AHEAD.
YOU1000000184_S0000008	SO JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD, IF WE WERE WATCHING A DISCUSSION BETWEEN YOU AND CHARLIE HASHING OUT THE MERITS OF REAL ESTATE, HOW WOULD WE GO?
YOU1000000184_S0000009	WELL, IT WOULD GO LIKE ALL OUR OTHER CONVERSATIONS. HE WOULD SAY NO FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES.
YOU1000000184_S0000011	AND I WOULD GAUGE BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE, THE EMOTION HE PUT INTO HIS NOSE, WHETHER HE REALLY LIKED THE DEAL OR NOT.
YOU1000000184_S0000013	YEAH.
YOU1000000184_S0000015	WE BOTH HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE, AND CHARLIE MADE HIS EARLY MONEY IN REAL ESTATE.
YOU1000000184_S0000016	THE SECOND POINT IS THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT. REAL ESTATE IS NOT A COMMODITY.
YOU1000000184_S0000018	I THINK IT TENDS TO BE MORE ACCURATELY PRICED.
YOU1000000184_S0000019	PRETTY DEVELOPED REAL ESTATE, MORE ACCURATELY PRICED MOST OF THE TIME.
YOU1000000184_S0000020	DURING THE RTC PERIOD, WHEN YOU HAD HUGE AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS, AND YOU HAD AN OWNER THAT DIDN'T WANT TO BE AN OWNER IN A VERY BIG WAY, AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY OWNED, AND ALL OF THAT SORT OF THING.
YOU1000000184_S0000021	I MEAN, YOU HAD A LOT OF MISPRICING THEN,
YOU1000000184_S0000023	UNDER
YOU1000000184_S0000025	MOST CONDITIONS, IT'S HARD TO FIND REAL ESTATE THAT'S REALLY MISPRICED. I MEAN, WHEN I LOOK AT THE TRANSACTIONS THAT REITS ENGAGE IN CURRENTLY, AND YOU GET A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THAT SORT OF THING,
YOU1000000184_S0000026	YOU KNOW, THEY'RE VERY SUMMER.
YOU1000000184_S0000028	BUT IT'S A COMPETITIVE WORLD AND...
YOU1000000184_S0000029	AND, YOU KNOW, THEY ALL KNOW ABOUT WHAT A CLASS A OFFICE BUILDING IN CHICAGO OR WHEREVER IT MAY BE IS GOING TO PRODUCE. AT LEAST THEY HAVE, THEY MAY ALL BE WRONG AS IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE OF SOME UNUSUAL EVENTS.
YOU1000000184_S0000030	BUT IT'S HARD TO ARGUE WITH THE CURRENT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM MOST OF THE TIME IN THE REAL ESTATE WORLD.
YOU1000000184_S0000031	BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE COULD BE BIG OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIELD. BUT IF THEY EXIST,
YOU1000000184_S0000033	IT WILL CERTAINLY BE BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT OF CHAOS IN REAL ESTATE FINANCING FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER. WE'VE DONE SOME REAL ESTATE FINANCING.
YOU1000000184_S0000035	YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY SHUT OFF.
YOU1000000184_S0000037	TO QUITE A DEGREE, PROBABLY TO GET ANY BIG MISPRICING ACROSS THE BOARD. CHARLIE?
YOU1000000184_S0000039	YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE ANY.
YOU1000000184_S0000041	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER EXPERIENCED REAL ESTATE INVESTORS IN THE FIELD.
YOU1000000184_S0000043	AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE IF WE WERE OPERATING WITH OUR OWN MONEY AS A PARTNERSHIP.
YOU1000000184_S0000045	AND IF YOU OPERATE AS A CORPORATION SUCH AS OURS, WHICH IS TAXABLE UNDER
YOU1000000184_S0000047	CHAPTER C OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE LAYER OF CORPORATE TAXES.
YOU1000000184_S0000048	BETWEEN THE REAL ESTATE INCOME AND THE USE OF THE INCOME BY THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE REAL ESTATE.
YOU1000000184_S0000050	BY ITS NATURE, REAL ESTATE TENDS TO BE A VERY LOUSY INVESTMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TAXED UNDER SUBCHAPTER C OF THE CODE RELATING TO CORPORATIONS. SO THE COMBINATION OF HAVING A
YOU1000000184_S0000052	GENERALLY ALLOWS THE ACTIVITY FOR PEOPLE WITH OUR TAX STRUCTURE AND HAVING NO SPECIAL COMPETENCE IN THE FIELD.
YOU1000000184_S0000053	MEANS THAT WE SPEND ALMOST NO TIME THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING IN REAL ESTATE AND THEN SUCH REAL ESTATE AS WE'VE ACTUALLY
YOU1000000184_S0000055	DONE LIKE HOLDING SURPLUS.
YOU1000000184_S0000057	I'D SAY WE HAVE A POOR RECORD AT IT.
YOU1000000184_S0000059	C CORPS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I MEAN, I KNOW THERE ARE C CORPS AROUND THAT ARE IN REAL ESTATE, BUT THERE ARE OTHER STRUCTURES THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE. THERE REALLY AREN'T OTHER STRUCTURES.
YOU1000000184_S0000060	I MEAN, LLOYD'S IS AN ATTEMPT AT IT TO SOME DEGREE, BUT THERE ARE OTHER STRUCTURES THAT WORK WELL FOR BIG INSURANCE COMPANIES. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALMART VERY WELL THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN A C CORP.
YOU1000000184_S0000061	SO THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO S CORP OR PARTNERSHIP COMPETITION THAT DETERMINES THE RETURNS ON CAPITAL IN THE DISCOUNT STORE FIELD.
YOU1000000184_S0000062	BUT IF YOU'RE COMPETING WITH THE EQUIVALENT OF S CORPS,
YOU1000000184_S0000064	OR PARTNERSHIPS OR INDIVIDUALS.
YOU1000000184_S0000065	YOU'VE JUST GOT AN ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE AS A C CORP, WHICH IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T LOVE READING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
YOU1000000184_S0000067	CORPORATION THAT YOU THINK OF ALL OF THE DOW JONES COMPANIES ALL OF THE S&P COMPANIES AND SO ON.
YOU1000000184_S0000069	AND THE.
YOU1000000184_S0000071	AS CHARLIE SAYS, IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE DISADVANTAGE OF OUR STRUCTURE, COMBINED WITH THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF PEOPLE WITH BETTER STRUCTURES, BUYING THOSE KINDS OF ASSETS, WILL EVER LEAD TO ANYTHING.
YOU1000000184_S0000072	REALLY INTERESTING, ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT WE MISSED THE BOAT TO SOME EXTENT DURING THE RTC DAYS.
YOU1000000184_S0000074	IT WAS A SUFFICIENTLY INEFFICIENT MARKET AT THAT TIME, AND THERE WAS A LACK OF FINANCING THAT WE COULD HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY IF WE HAD BEEN GEARED UP FOR IT AT THAT TIME.
YOU1000000184_S0000075	WE ACTUALLY HAD A FEW TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE PRETTY INTERESTING, BUT NOTHING THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL CAPITAL.
YOU1000000184_S0000076	WE THOUGHT SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT BUYING THE IRVINE CORPORATION WHEN IT BECAME AVAILABLE.
YOU1000000184_S0000078	BUT THAT'S THE ONLY BIG ONE I CAN REMEMBER THAT WE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT ABOUT.
YOU1000000184_S0000080	YEAH, THAT WAS IN 1977.
YOU1000000184_S0000082	YEAH, MOBIL OIL WAS INTERESTED AND DON BRENNAN ENDED UP PUTTING TOGETHER A GROUP FOR IT.
YOU1000000184_S0000084	COULD CONCEIVABLY HAPPEN, BUT IT'S UNLIKELY.
YOU1000000185_S0000001	HELLO EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL EDITION OF THE US CHAMBER FOUNDATION'S PATH FORWARD SERIES.
YOU1000000185_S0000002	IF YOU'VE BEEN A REGULAR VIEWER, WELCOME BACK. IF YOU'RE NEW TO THE SERIES, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE HOPE YOU FIND IT BOTH INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING.
YOU1000000185_S0000003	AND BOY, DID YOU PICK A GREAT WEEK TO TUNE IN OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. WE'VE BEEN BRINGING TOGETHER EXPERTS IN A NUMBER OF CRITICAL FIELDS.
YOU1000000185_S0000004	ALL AROUND THE TOPIC OF RETURNING TO WORK. TODAY, WE'RE THRILLED TO BE JOINED BY TWO OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL PHILANTHROPISTS IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000185_S0000005	BILL AND MELINDA GATES HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO ADVANCING SCIENCE AND IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH, AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES.
YOU1000000185_S0000006	THE US CHAMBER FOUNDATION HAS A DEEP RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GATES FOUNDATION.
YOU1000000185_S0000007	FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON BOTH K 12 AND POST SECONDARY EDUCATION REFORMS.
YOU1000000185_S0000008	WE VALUE THEIR PARTNERSHIP AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE BILL AND MELINDA GATES WITH US HERE TODAY.
YOU1000000185_S0000009	AS YOU'VE LIKELY SEEN, A FEW YEARS AGO BILL BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE RISKS OF A DEADLY GLOBAL PANDEMIC. SADLY, HIS WARNING IS NOW OUR REALITY.
YOU1000000185_S0000010	THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT HE AND MELINDA HAVE COMMITTED THEMSELVES AND THEIR ORGANIZATION TO FINDING A SOLUTION, AND THAT GIVES US ALL A SENSE OF HOPE.
YOU1000000185_S0000011	THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION HAS COMMITTED MORE THAN $300 MILLION TO THE GLOBAL COVID 19 RESPONSE.
YOU1000000185_S0000012	WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP DURING THIS TRYING MOMENT AND EXCITED TO TALK TO THEM TODAY.
YOU1000000185_S0000013	THIS EPISODE WAS PRE RECORDED TO FIT THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES, SO THERE WON'T BE AUDIENCE QUESTIONS AT THE END THIS TIME. BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT WE GET TO TALK ABOUT, AND SO LET'S GET TO IT.
YOU1000000185_S0000015	WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS WE WILL JUST WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN AND SO LET ME ASK YOU BOTH.
YOU1000000185_S0000016	WHAT IS THE GATES FOUNDATION DOING TO FIGHT THE CORONAVIRUS AND WHY IS IT SUCH A PRIORITY FOR YOU?
YOU1000000185_S0000018	OUR FOUNDATION HAS A.
YOU1000000185_S0000020	BIG FOCUS ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, PRIMARILY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
YOU1000000185_S0000021	AND SO, YOU KNOW, OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW YOU DESIGN A VACCINE, WE FUNDED LOTS OF NEW VACCINES.
YOU1000000185_S0000022	WE'RE A PARTNER IN GAVI, WHICH ACTUALLY BUYS VACCINES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THE EXPERTISE THAT'S NOT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PICK
YOU1000000185_S0000023	WHICH OF THESE WE SHOULD BUILD FACTORIES FOR AND HOW WE COORDINATE ALL THIS ACTIVITY. AND SO IT'S BECOME A HUGE FOCUS FOR US.
YOU1000000185_S0000024	AND OF COURSE, THE BENEFIT OF GETTING THE VACCINE, YOU KNOW, EVEN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS EARLIER WILL BE VERY DRAMATIC IN TERMS OF ENDING THESE
YOU1000000185_S0000025	AWFUL ECONOMIC EFFECTS AS WELL AS THE DEATH AND DISEASE.
YOU1000000185_S0000027	MELINDA, WHEN DO YOU THINK WE'LL SEE A VACCINE AT SCALE? AND A TWO PART QUESTION.
YOU1000000185_S0000028	YOU'VE ALSO TALKED BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE. SO WHEN DO YOU SEE THIS AT SCALE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION EQUITABLE?
YOU1000000185_S0000029	YES, SO I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT JUST SEEING THE VARIOUS VACCINE CANDIDATES THAT ARE COMING THROUGH THE PIPELINE, THERE ARE THREE THAT ARE LOOKING QUITE PROMISING, LUCKILY.
YOU1000000185_S0000030	AND I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT BY 2021, WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE.
YOU1000000185_S0000031	WE'RE WORKING AHEAD OF TIME WITH THE MANUFACTURERS, WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO TRY AND ACTUALLY HAVE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY READY TO GO.
YOU1000000185_S0000032	SO AS SOON AS THOSE TRIALS ARE FINISHED, THE VACCINE CAN GO IMMEDIATELY INTO THE MANUFACTURING.
YOU1000000185_S0000033	AND THE WHOLE REASON WE GOT INVOLVED IN THIS VACCINE WAS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION.
YOU1000000185_S0000034	THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS A BIDDING WAR BETWEEN COUNTRIES FOR THIS VACCINE. WE KNOW THERE ARE 60 MILLION HEALTH CARE WORKERS AROUND THE WORLD
YOU1000000185_S0000035	WHO ARE KEEPING EVERYBODY SAFE, THEY DESERVE TO GET THIS VACCINE FIRST. AND FROM THERE, YOU WANT TO DO TIERING IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES
YOU1000000185_S0000036	TO MAKE SURE YOUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS GET IT. IN OUR COUNTRY, THAT WOULD BE BLACKS AND NATIVE AMERICANS, PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND THE ELDERLY.
YOU1000000185_S0000037	AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS A GLOBE AND WE'RE INVOLVED WITH MANY EUROPEAN LEADERS AND AFRICAN LEADERS AND OTHERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA TO MAKE SURE.
YOU1000000185_S0000038	THERE'S A PURCHASING FUND THAT CAN PULL THAT VACCINE THROUGH WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE AND GET IT OUT IN WIDE SCALE DISTRIBUTION.
YOU1000000185_S0000040	GOSH, I HAVE SO MANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. I'LL TRY TO STAY FOCUSED SO LET ME. GO BACK TO BILL FOR A SECOND. YOU GOT WIDESPREAD ATTENTION. FOR PREDICTION YOU MADE IN 2015.
YOU1000000185_S0000041	ABOUT THE DANGERS OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. AND YOU, SADLY FOR THE WORLD, DID PREDICT THE FUTURE. AND SO LET ME ASK YOU TO DO IT AGAIN. WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT NOW?
YOU1000000185_S0000043	WELL, THIS WON'T BE THE LAST PANDEMIC THAT WE FACE. PANDEMICS CAN COME FROM NATURAL CAUSES.
YOU1000000185_S0000044	WHICH IS LARGELY COMING ACROSS FROM OTHER SPECIES. A FLU, FOR EXAMPLE, IS STILL A VERY BIG RISK.
YOU1000000185_S0000045	AND SO WE'LL HAVE TO INVEST.
YOU1000000185_S0000047	IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CATCH THE DISEASE SOONER AND THAT WE HAVE PLATFORMS TO MAKE DIAGNOSTICS, THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES VERY QUICKLY.
YOU1000000185_S0000048	VERY LITTLE WAS INVESTED, EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE THESE CALLS BY A LOT OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING OUR FOUNDATION.
YOU1000000185_S0000049	ONE GROUP THAT WAS FUNDED, THE COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS AND INNOVATION, CEPI,
YOU1000000185_S0000050	WE WELCOME TRUST NORWAY, UK, JAPAN WERE THE INITIAL FUNDERS AND THAT IS HELPING OUT HERE.
YOU1000000185_S0000051	SO WE'RE BETTER OFF THAN IF THAT HADN'T HAPPENED. BUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TRUST GOVERNMENT TO THINK THROUGH
YOU1000000185_S0000052	THESE EVENTUAL BAD THINGS. THIS WAS A FAILURE TO GET READY.
YOU1000000185_S0000053	AND THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN TINY COMPARED TO SAY WHAT WE SPEND ON BEING READY FOR WAR. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO THE SIMULATION TO THINK ABOUT.
YOU1000000185_S0000054	OKAY, WHAT ABOUT NURSING HOMES? WHAT ABOUT GETTING FACTORIES READY? WHAT ABOUT THE TESTING REGIME?
YOU1000000185_S0000055	YOU KNOW, IN FACT, THE TESTING COULD HAVE BEEN RAMPED UP VERY QUICKLY IN A FEW COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALMOST AVOIDED THE EPIDEMIC ENTIRELY, LIKE
YOU1000000185_S0000057	TAIWAN, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, YOU KNOW, THEY TOOK THEIR EXPERIENCE AND ACTUALLY PREPARED AND SO THEY MOVED A LOT FASTER.
YOU1000000185_S0000058	SO WE.
YOU1000000185_S0000060	YOU KNOW, WE'LL HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ONE.
YOU1000000185_S0000062	I'D SAY IS, WILL GET ATTENTION THIS TIME.
YOU1000000185_S0000064	SO YOU KNOW THAT REMINDS ME OF GOING BACK TO THE VACCINE, MELINDA, AND I PROMISED TO MOVE OFF OF IT, BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER HAD A VACCINE FOR CORONAVIRUS.
YOU1000000185_S0000065	AND THAT MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS TIME. SO I THINK THE AUDIENCE WILL BE SO PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR OPTIMISM FOR THIS, RIGHT?
YOU1000000185_S0000066	WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAT MAKES US THINK THE DEVELOPMENT WILL HAPPEN? IS IT THIS GLOBAL COORDINATION?
YOU1000000185_S0000067	IT'S THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WORKING TOGETHER WITH SCIENTISTS FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE IN A VERY COORDINATED FASHION.
YOU1000000185_S0000068	WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COMPANIES COME TOGETHER IN THIS WAY AND ALSO TO BE THINKING AHEAD ABOUT MANUFACTURING.
YOU1000000185_S0000069	AND MANUFACTURING NOT JUST FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY OR THEIR OWN REGION, BUT FOR OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD. AND SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES US OPTIMISTIC IS THE MANY, MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING.
YOU1000000185_S0000070	THE WAY WE'RE SEEING THE SCIENTISTS MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DATA AS SOON AS THEY GET IT. AND ALSO SEEING GLOBAL LEADERS COME TOGETHER.
YOU1000000185_S0000071	LIKE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, DID A HUGE PLEDGING EVENT FOR THIS VACCINE ALLIANCE THAT WE'VE BEEN PART OF AND SEEING MONEY COME TOGETHER TO SAY.
YOU1000000185_S0000072	WE NEED THIS SO THAT IT'S READY WHEN THE VACCINE'S READY TO GO, WE CAN ACTUALLY PURCHASE THAT VACCINE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD.
YOU1000000185_S0000074	AND DO YOU THINK BILL THE SAME THING IS TRUE ON THERAPEUTICS AND TESTING? I MEAN, DO YOU THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE COMING TOGETHER WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO BE?
YOU1000000185_S0000075	ON THE OTHER SIDES OF THE EQUATION AS WELL.
YOU1000000185_S0000077	WELL, PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT FLAT FOOTED IN THAT USUALLY THE US IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED.
YOU1000000185_S0000078	THIS NEW DRUG THAT GOT PROVEN OUT, THAT'S A TRIAL NETWORK WE FUNDED WITH OTHERS WITH WELLCOME TRUST IN THE UK.
YOU1000000185_S0000079	YOU KNOW, USUALLY YOU EXPECT THE US TO DO GOOD COORDINATED TRIALS AND, YOU KNOW, TO PICK DRUGS FOR THEIR SCIENTIFIC MERIT.
YOU1000000185_S0000080	THE WORLD HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD TIME WHEN THE US TESTING THING WENT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.
YOU1000000185_S0000081	WHEN IT HASN'T BEEN A FEDERAL NOTION OF HOW YOU PRIORITIZE THINGS. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THE EUROPEANS ARE FILLING THAT VACUUM, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF CARING.
YOU1000000185_S0000082	FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. THEIR GENEROSITY HAS BEEN QUITE GOOD. PEOPLE HOPE THAT THE US COMES BACK.
YOU1000000185_S0000083	ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, WITHDRAWING FROM WHO IS A STEP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HISTORICALLY, THE US, YOU KNOW, WE DID SMALLPOX ERADICATION.
YOU1000000185_S0000084	ROTARY'S BEEN BEHIND THE POLIO PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE, WHICH IS DONE THROUGH WHO.
YOU1000000185_S0000085	AND A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE US MONEY THAT GOES THERE IS FOR THAT POLIO ERADICATION. AND SO THERE'S STILL A CHANCE FOR THE US.
YOU1000000185_S0000086	TO CONTRIBUTE ON THIS AND NOT JUST THINKING OF ITSELF, BUT ALSO IN THE SAME WAY WE DID
YOU1000000185_S0000087	AND PARTICULARLY PRESIDENT BUSH AND PEPFAR DID, HELPING OUT THE ENTIRE WORLD.
YOU1000000185_S0000089	YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BOTH BEEN REALLY VOCAL ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE THIS A GLOBAL RESPONSE AND TO HELP PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS.
YOU1000000185_S0000090	IF YOU WERE TALKING TO IN THIS AUDIENCE A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY SOMEWHERE WHO MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND THAT.
YOU1000000185_S0000091	EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE REACH BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND HELP CONTROL THIS VIRUS.
YOU1000000185_S0000092	WELL, I THINK YOU KNOW COVID ANYWHERE IS COVID EVERYWHERE AND SO FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER.
YOU1000000185_S0000093	YOU KNOW, THE SUPPLIES THAT COME IN THAT HELP YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS DON'T ALL NECESSARILY COME FROM THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000185_S0000095	AND YOUR CUSTOMERS PROBABLY AREN'T ALL JUST US CUSTOMERS. AND SO IF WE WANT TO HAVE GLOBAL TRADE AND A GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN.
YOU1000000185_S0000096	IN GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, WE HAVE TO GET THE WHOLE WORLD COORDINATED IN ITS RESPONSE TO THIS DISEASE BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE CONTAINED
YOU1000000185_S0000097	IN ONE OR TWO PLACES, EVEN ONCE WE'VE GOTTEN IT OUTSIDE OF THE US BORDERS.
YOU1000000185_S0000098	AND TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE US HAS SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO TRY AND DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM HERE. WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT LESS THAN A FEW PERCENT.
YOU1000000185_S0000099	THAT OF THAT, THAT WOULD NEED TO BE SPENT ON HELPING GET RID OF THE DISEASE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
YOU1000000185_S0000100	SO IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME GIGANTIC TRADE OFF. THESE ARE VERY SMALL DOLLARS, JUST LIKE THE WHO IS $500 MILLION A YEAR.
YOU1000000185_S0000101	YOU KNOW, FOR THINGS LIKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, VACCINES, POLIO, COVERS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS.
YOU1000000185_S0000102	AND SO IT'S NOT COMPETING BUDGET WISE WITH THE LARGE SCALE RESOURCES.
YOU1000000185_S0000104	YOU KNOW, YOUR FOUNDATION DOES AMAZING WORK. WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TO BE PARTNERS FOR A LONG TIME ON SOME K THROUGH 12 EDUCATION WORK.
YOU1000000185_S0000105	WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE THAT SUPPORT AND AMPLIFY THAT GOOD WORK. AND IT MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT HOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING IN A BROADER SENSE.
YOU1000000185_S0000106	AS A RESULT OF THIS VIRUS. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU, I MEAN, MELINDA, LET ME GO TO YOU FIRST. WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN TERMS OF SOME LASTING CHANGES?
YOU1000000185_S0000107	AS A RESULT OF THIS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS.
YOU1000000185_S0000108	WELL, I THINK THAT'S YET TO COME. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S UP TO US AS CITIZENS TO REBUILD THE WORLD THAT WE WANT.
YOU1000000185_S0000109	I THINK THIS CRISIS HAS EXPOSED SOME OF THE GAPS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU1000000185_S0000110	AND ONE OF THOSE IN PARTICULAR ARE THE GENDER AND THE RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT EXIST.
YOU1000000185_S0000111	IN TERMS OF GENDER, WE KNOW THAT WOMEN DO TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE WORK AT HOME THAN MEN DO. AND THAT'S THE UNPAID LABOR OF
YOU1000000185_S0000112	CARING FOR THE KIDS, MAKING THE LUNCH, MAKING SURE THEY'RE ONLINE LEARNING RIGHT NOW.
YOU1000000185_S0000113	AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT WILL EXPOSE FOR US THAT IS JUST WAY PAST TIME THAT THE US HAS A PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY. WE'RE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION THAT DOESN'T.
YOU1000000185_S0000114	AND IF WE WANT TO PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK SAFELY AND KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE FROM GETTING SICK, WE NEED TO HAVE PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE.
YOU1000000185_S0000115	AND SO I THINK CONGRESS IN ITS WISDOM AND TWO OF THE STIMULUS BILLS STARTED TO ADDRESS THAT. WE NEED A LONG TERM SOLUTION.
YOU1000000185_S0000116	THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS NOT ONLY HAS COVID EXPOSED THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM, IT'S ALSO SHOWED US OPPORTUNITIES. LIKE THE FACT THAT KIDS COULD JUMP ONLINE
YOU1000000185_S0000117	AND START LEARNING. NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT ALL KIDS BECAUSE MANY KIDS DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER OR GOOD DIGITAL LITERACY ONLINE.
YOU1000000185_S0000118	OR TEACHERS WHO KNEW HOW TO TEACH ONLINE, BUT WE KNOW NOW IT'S POSSIBLE. AND SO I THINK NOW WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT TECHNOLOGY GETS SPREAD EQUITABLY.
YOU1000000185_S0000119	AND THOSE GREAT LESSON PLANS AND ADVISING THAT CAN HAPPEN. I THINK ONE LAST EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE ON DIGITAL IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
YOU1000000185_S0000120	THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PHONES AND DO DIGITAL BANKING ON THEIR PHONE. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MONEY ON THEIR PHONE, MOBILE MONEY THAT WAS AT SCALE IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES.
YOU1000000185_S0000121	BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN, PEOPLE REALLY SAID, OH MY GOSH, DO NOT HAVE TO STAND IN LINE FOR MY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT WHERE I MIGHT GET SICK.
YOU1000000185_S0000122	SO JUST TO TAKE PAKISTAN ALONE IN 48 HOURS, 40 MILLION ADDITIONAL PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR DIGITAL BANK ACCOUNT. THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN USE.
YOU1000000185_S0000123	AND PARTICULARLY USED TO REACH LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND WOMEN ON THAT PHONE WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS LIKE CASH TRANSFERS.
YOU1000000185_S0000124	MORE INFORMATION, MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. SO
YOU1000000185_S0000125	THOSE SOME OF THOSE DIGITAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE REALLY HITTING IN WAYS WE DIDN'T EXPECT AS QUICKLY AS WE HAD BEEN HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD.
YOU1000000185_S0000127	I LOVE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE'RE AFRAID OF RIGHT NOW, BOTH IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY AND HOW TO RIGHT THIS SOCIAL INJUSTICE SHIP.
YOU1000000185_S0000128	AND THERE'S A LOT WE'RE AFRAID OF AND IT'S NICE TO THINK ABOUT SOME OPTIMISTIC OUTCOMES FOR THIS TOO. SO THE OTHER DAY IN AN INTERVIEW DAVID RUBENSTEIN ASKED ME
YOU1000000185_S0000129	WHAT I HAD LEARNED ABOUT WORKING REMOTELY. AND I ADMITTED TO HIM THAT I WAS CONDUCTING A LOT OF INTERVIEWS WITHOUT SHOES ON.
YOU1000000185_S0000130	I'M PLEADING THE FIFTH ABOUT MY SHOELESS STATE AT THE MOMENT. BUT WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOURSELVES IN THIS TIME AND WHAT HAS CHANGED ABOUT THE WAY THAT YOU'RE WORKING?
YOU1000000185_S0000132	WELL, IT'S IMPRESSIVE THAT FOR OFFICE WORK IT
YOU1000000185_S0000134	YOU KNOW, PARTLY BUILT IN ON THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU BUILT UP OVERTIME. YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO QUITE WELL IN OUR FOUNDATION HAS AN.
YOU1000000185_S0000136	NOBODY'S BEEN IN THE OFFICE FOR OVER THREE MONTHS NOW AND YET OUR WORK IS GOING ON PRETTY MUCH FULL SPEED.
YOU1000000185_S0000137	AND YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I'M INVOLVED WITH SOFTWARE, I THINK OK, WE CAN MAKE THESE SOFTWARE PLATFORMS EVEN BETTER.
YOU1000000185_S0000138	MAKE IT EASY TO TAKE NOTES OR SHARE THINGS OR HAVE SIDE CONVERSATIONS.
YOU1000000185_S0000139	BUT IT'S BEEN DECENT ENOUGH TO ALLOW A LOT TO HAPPEN AND IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO ACCELERATE THE IDEA OF DO WE NEED TO TRAVEL AS MUCH
YOU1000000185_S0000141	YOU KNOW, HOW GOOD CAN WE MAKE ONLINE EDUCATION, HOW GOOD CAN WE MAKE TELEMEDICINE,
YOU1000000185_S0000142	IT'S LIKE 10 YEARS OF
YOU1000000185_S0000144	PROGRESS ON THOSE THINGS WILL GET COMPRESSED DOWN INTO JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS.
YOU1000000185_S0000146	YEAH.
YOU1000000185_S0000147	I WOULD SAY OUR LIVES, LIKE EVERYBODY AROUND THE UNITED STATES, HAVE CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY. WE'RE INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE NOT TO BE STRUGGLING TO PUT A MEAL ON THE TABLE. WE JUST ARE LUCKY.
YOU1000000185_S0000148	BUT YES, OUR WORK LIVES, YOU KNOW, WORKING FROM HOME WAS NOT SOMETHING WE DID AS MUCH BEFORE. WE'RE CERTAINLY USING A LOT OF MICROSOFT TEAMS AND ZOOM AND OTHER THINGS.
YOU1000000185_S0000149	LIKE YOU, SUZANNE, I HAVE CHANGED. I'VE CLAIMED THAT WHEN I GO BACK TO WORK, I WILL NOT BE WEARING HEELS. I AM GOING TO WEAR MY TENNIS SHOES BECAUSE I WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME NOW.
YOU1000000185_S0000150	FOR EVERY SINGLE MEETING, INCLUDING RIGHT NOW. AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS I'M NOT GOING TO TRAVEL AS MUCH.
YOU1000000185_S0000151	I THINK THERE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE MEETINGS I TRAVEL FOR AND I STILL THINK THERE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY REASONS TO GO TO AFRICA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.
YOU1000000185_S0000152	BUT I THINK CONFERENCES CAN BE CHANGED AND WE'RE SEEING MANY, MANY PEOPLE DO THEM ONLINE NOW. AND SO I DO THINK I WILL TRAVEL LESS, WHICH I THINK WILL GIVE ME MORE TIME TO JUST ENJOY LIFE.
YOU1000000185_S0000153	AND TAKE THE BREAKS THAT I TAKE HERE IN SEATTLE BETWEEN MY ZOOM MEETINGS TO STEP OUTSIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE.
YOU1000000185_S0000154	WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT THE WORLD CAN TAKE YOU GUYS TAKING TOO MUCH TIME OFF. I THINK WE NEED YOUR HARD WORK AND BIG HEARTS FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING.
YOU1000000185_S0000155	AND YOU'RE REALLY KIND TO HAVE SPENT THIS TIME WITH US THIS EVENING. SO THANK YOU BOTH VERY, VERY MUCH.
YOU1000000185_S0000156	THANKS, SUZANNE. THANKS FOR HAVING US.
YOU1000000186_S0000002	IT IS VERY, VERY RARE, AND THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, TO GET, IN MY OPINION, TWO OF THE REALLY GREATEST HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE HAVE LIVING ON THIS PLANET
YOU1000000186_S0000003	TODAY AND BOTH TOGETHER. THEY'VE NEVER BEEN TOGETHER BEFORE, ALTHOUGH I'VE HAD THEM INDIVIDUALLY.
YOU1000000186_S0000004	AND THEY HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON.
YOU1000000186_S0000005	BILL GATES AND AAMIR KHAN, WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON?
YOU1000000186_S0000006	THEY'RE TWO OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST SCHOOL AND COLLEGE DROPOUTS. NUMBER ONE.
YOU1000000186_S0000008	SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DROP OUT, DON'T WORRY.
YOU1000000186_S0000010	THIS IS YOUR FUTURE.
YOU1000000186_S0000011	THEY'RE ALSO IN A WAY MOVING ON TO PHASE TWO OF THEIR LIVES, A NEW CHAPTER.
YOU1000000186_S0000013	I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE ANECDOTE WHEN ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT, WHEN BILL GATES WAS IN HIS PHASE ONE OF HIS LIFE.
YOU1000000186_S0000014	AND WE WERE TALKING TO A WHOLE LOT OF SOFTWARE PEOPLE RATHER THAN MORE INTERESTING PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
YOU1000000186_S0000015	I ASKED HIM TO GIVE A SOUND CHECK, SAY 1, 2, 3, 4.
YOU1000000186_S0000016	AND HE SAID, ONE BILLION, TWO BILLION, THREE BILLION.
YOU1000000186_S0000018	HE WAS COUNTING NOTES THEN. NOW HE'S COUNTING PEOPLE BEING SAVED BY VACCINATION, BY VACCINES, IN TERMS OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THEM.
YOU1000000186_S0000019	IT'S A HUGE, TERRIFIC CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE, PHASE TWO.
YOU1000000186_S0000020	AND AMIT, IN A WAY, YOU'VE ALSO MOVED FROM... OF COURSE, YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YOUR EARLIER ACTING CAREER,
YOU1000000186_S0000021	BUT YOU HAVE ALSO MOVED ON TO SOCIAL ISSUES WITH THIS MOST PATH BREAKING TELEVISION PROGRAM, WHICH HAD A HUGE IMPACT.
YOU1000000186_S0000022	AND EVERYBODY SAID, YOU'RE NUTS. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS SORT OF STUFF? WHY DON'T YOU STICK TO MOVIES? SO WHAT MOTIVATED, WHAT CAUSED THAT CHANGE?
YOU1000000186_S0000023	YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S
YOU1000000186_S0000025	YOU KNOW, I WAS AT A DISCUSSION SOMETIME BACK AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED TO MY TEAM
YOU1000000186_S0000027	WHAT ARE THE...
YOU1000000186_S0000029	WHAT ARE THE GOOD QUALITIES THAT A GOOD NGO SHOULD HAVE? THOSE QUESTIONS ASKED TO
YOU1000000186_S0000031	YES.
YOU1000000186_S0000032	HE SAID THAT ONE OF THE GOOD QUALITIES ANY NGO SHOULD HAVE OR ANY PERSON WHO WANTS TO BE PART OF SOCIAL SERVICE SHOULD HAVE IS THAT
YOU1000000186_S0000034	IT'S NOT JUST THE EMOTION OF WANTING TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. WHICH IS IN ITSELF A GOOD EMOTION. THAT YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE.
YOU1000000186_S0000035	BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR LIFE IS INCOMPLETE IF YOU DON'T.
YOU1000000186_S0000036	RIGHT.
YOU1000000186_S0000037	SO YOU'RE DOING IT FOR YOURSELF REALLY.
YOU1000000186_S0000038	RIGHT.
YOU1000000186_S0000039	OF COURSE YOU'RE DOING IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IS IMPORTANT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU IF YOU FEEL LIKE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN TO YOU.
YOU1000000186_S0000040	BUT I THINK IN ME WHAT GREW WAS THAT THIS FEELING THAT I NEEDED TO FOR MYSELF DO SOMETHING WHERE I FELT BETTER ABOUT MYSELF WHEN I FELT I WAS YOU KNOW I FEEL I'M SO PRIVILEGED IN SO MANY WAYS.
YOU1000000186_S0000041	AND I FEEL THAT, I REALLY FEEL THAT WHEN I SEE AROUND ME PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS PRIVILEGED, I CAN'T JUST SIT BY AND BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
YOU1000000186_S0000042	THAT, THERE IS A NEED IN ME TO REACH OUT AND PERHAPS
YOU1000000186_S0000044	YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE A POSITION WHERE PEOPLE WILL LISTEN.
YOU1000000186_S0000046	I'D LIKE TO USE IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES.
YOU1000000186_S0000048	SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'VE MOVED INTO THE SPACE THAT I HAVE. IT'S FOR MY OWN EMOTIONAL OR MENTAL, YOU KNOW, PEACE OF MIND AND SATISFACTION.
YOU1000000186_S0000049	AND BILL GATES
YOU1000000186_S0000051	YOU'VE ALSO GOT A LITTLE MORE EMOTIONAL IN PHASE TWO.
YOU1000000186_S0000052	I'VE SEEN YOU ALMOST CHOKE UP TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAD, ABOUT HOW YOUR WIFE MOTIVATED YOU, HOW YOUR DAD'S YOUR HERO, AND HOW ALL THIS MEANS A LITTLE MORE TO YOUR HEART THAN YOUR HEAD.
YOU1000000186_S0000053	SO WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO MAKE THIS CHANGE?
YOU1000000186_S0000055	I THINK IT'S VERY SIMILAR. I LOVED MY CAREER IN SOFTWARE AND BEING PART OF BUILDING MICROSOFT, THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, THE INTERNET.
YOU1000000186_S0000056	IN MY 20S AND 30S, I WAS FANATICAL.
YOU1000000186_S0000057	YEAH.
YOU1000000186_S0000058	AND I SAW WHAT INNOVATION COULD DO.
YOU1000000186_S0000059	BUT THERE CAME A POINT WHERE I THOUGHT, HEY, I SHOULD TURN THAT WORK OVER TO OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU1000000186_S0000060	AND THINK ABOUT HOW INNOVATION DOESN'T NATURALLY BENEFIT EVERYONE. IT DOESN'T REACH DOWN TO THE POOREST. IN FACT, I'D GOTTEN A CHANCE TO SEE SOME OF THAT AS I TRAVELED THE WORLD.
YOU1000000186_S0000061	AND AS A BIG BELIEVER IN INNOVATION, I THOUGHT, OK, WE CAN PUSH IT IN THAT DIRECTION.
YOU1000000186_S0000062	AND SO IT'S ALLOWED ME TO LEARN A LOT OF NEW THINGS.
YOU1000000186_S0000063	AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT EXCEPT FOR THE LOCK, THE VISIBILITY, THE RESOURCES THAT CAME FROM THAT FIRST CAREER.
YOU1000000186_S0000064	AND I ACTUALLY USE A LOT OF WHAT I LEARNED THEN IN TERMS OF ENGAGING SCIENTISTS AND DRIVING INNOVATION AS FAST AS WE CAN.
YOU1000000186_S0000065	AND HOW IMPORTANT WAS YOUR WIFE IN THIS CHAPTER TWO OF YOUR LIFE?
YOU1000000186_S0000067	WHEN I FIRST SAID TO MY WIFE THAT I WAS CONSIDERING RETIRING FROM MY FULL TIME WORK AT MICROSOFT IN A
YOU1000000186_S0000069	ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU1000000186_S0000070	WELL, NO, SHE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO JUMP ON IT BECAUSE SHE WANTED IT TO BE MY DECISION.
YOU1000000186_S0000071	YEAH.
YOU1000000186_S0000072	THAT I WOULD NEVER LOOK BACK AND FELT LIKE I'D REALLY PICKED THE TIME THAT I FELT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO CENTRAL TO MY LIFE.
YOU1000000186_S0000073	RIGHT.
YOU1000000186_S0000074	BUT SHE WAS CERTAINLY ENTHUSED ABOUT IT. DURING MY TIME AT MICROSOFT, I'D ALWAYS HAD SOMEBODY WHO WAS
YOU1000000186_S0000076	MY KEY PARTNER, PAUL ALLEN.
YOU1000000186_S0000078	STEVE BALLMER AS THE COMPANY BECAME BIG AND COMPLICATED.
YOU1000000186_S0000079	NOW, IN THIS ERA, IT'S REALLY MY WIFE WHO'S MY...
YOU1000000186_S0000081	AND SO WE GET TO DO THIS TOGETHER.
YOU1000000186_S0000082	AND GREAT MOTIVATOR. SHE'S A DRIVING FORCE BEHIND A LOT OF WHAT YOU DO.
YOU1000000186_S0000083	ABSOLUTELY, SHE'S VERY ENERGETIC ABOUT THESE THINGS. SHE'S ACTUALLY IN MALAYSIA THIS WEEK AT A WOMEN DELIVERS CONFERENCE TALKING ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND HOW WOMEN GET ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS.
YOU1000000186_S0000084	SO SHE'S EQUALLY PASSIONATE AND ALSO HAD A MICROSOFT CAREER. SO SOME OF THE WAYS WE THINK ABOUT MEASUREMENT AND MANAGING PEOPLE, GETTING THE BEST PEOPLE.
YOU1000000186_S0000085	WE'VE GOT A COMMON BACKGROUND.
YOU1000000186_S0000086	AMIR, WHEN BILL GATES LAUNCHED INTO THIS PHASE TWO, HE TALKED TO AND CONVINCED A LOT OF BILLIONAIRES AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY WARREN BUFFETT,
YOU1000000186_S0000087	TO DONATE A LOT, TO BE PHILANTHROPIC AND DONATE TO HIS ORGANIZATION OR TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND TO MAKE CHANGE.
YOU1000000186_S0000088	WHAT ABOUT IN INDIA? WE DON'T SEE ENOUGH OF THAT. WE'VE GOT A GREAT EXAMPLE OF...
YOU1000000186_S0000090	WHO YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR...
YOU1000000186_S0000091	YEAH, IN OUR SHOW WE DID SHOWCASE WHAT MR.
YOU1000000186_S0000093	DOING AND I THINK HE'S DOING REALLY WONDERFUL WORK AND REALLY WE SHOULD ALL TAKE CUE FROM THAT.
YOU1000000186_S0000094	AND CERTAINLY I FEEL THAT, I MEAN I DO BELIEVE THAT IN INDIA THERE IS A LOT OF PHILANTHROPY.
YOU1000000186_S0000095	YEAH.
YOU1000000186_S0000097	HUGE AMOUNTS THAT WE OFTEN DONATE BUT IT'S USUALLY TO RELIGIOUS
YOU1000000186_S0000098	RIGHT.
YOU1000000186_S0000099	ORGANIZATIONS. WE DONATE A LOT TO RELIGION.
YOU1000000186_S0000100	YES.
YOU1000000186_S0000101	MAYBE THAT IS A NEED IN US TO TRY AND SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE.
YOU1000000186_S0000103	INSURANCE POLICY.
YOU1000000186_S0000104	YEAH, YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT IF WE DONATE A LOT TO TEMPLES OR MOSQUES OR YOU KNOW RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND THAT'S WHERE I SEE MOST OF THE BIG DONATIONS GOING. SO IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T DONATE.
YOU1000000186_S0000105	YES.
YOU1000000186_S0000106	WE DONATE HUGE AMOUNTS BUT THEY GO INTO RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. WHEREAS WE DON'T DONATE INTO EDUCATION OR INTO HEALTHCARE.
YOU1000000186_S0000108	AND I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT IF YOU DONATE INTO EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE,
YOU1000000186_S0000110	THE GOD UP THERE IS GOING TO BE REALLY HAPPY.
YOU1000000186_S0000112	PROBABLY BE HAPPIER. SO I MEAN I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL OFF FINANCIALLY IN INDIA AND WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE TO NATION BUILDING.
YOU1000000186_S0000113	YES.
YOU1000000186_S0000114	TO BUILDING THIS NATION INTO WHAT IT CAN BE AND TO TRYING TO ACHIEVE ITS FULL POTENTIAL FOR THE YOUTH, FOR THE KIDS OF OUR COUNTRY.
YOU1000000186_S0000115	AND FOR THE EMOTIONAL HAPPINESS FOR ALL OF US. THEN THAT IS ONE AREA THAT WE CAN REALLY HELP IN.
YOU1000000186_S0000116	DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE...
YOU1000000186_S0000117	IN DONATING HUGE SUMS INTO EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE AND OTHER SUCH THINGS.
YOU1000000186_S0000119	RATHER THAN JUST RELIGION.
YOU1000000186_S0000120	DO YOU THINK YOU NEED TWO HANDS TO CLAP? IT'S A BIT OF A FAILURE ON THE LACK OF INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE THAT THE MONEY HAS GONE TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
YOU1000000186_S0000121	LIKE, IF YOU DONATE TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S RELIEF FUND, YOU JUST FEEL GOD KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN, WHERE IT'LL GO, PART OF THE BUDGET.
YOU1000000186_S0000122	BUT IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING, AN INDIAN EQUIVALENT OF THE GATES FOUNDATION, OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU KNOW...
YOU1000000186_S0000123	I SPEND THE MONEY HERE, IT'S NOT GOING TO GO TOO MUCH TO SALARIES, IT'S GOING TO GO TARGETED.
YOU1000000186_S0000124	I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT ENTIRELY.
YOU1000000186_S0000126	BECAUSE I FEEL THAT WHILE YES WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE PUTTING OUR MONEY
YOU1000000186_S0000127	OR WHERE ARE WE DOING THE ENDING. THAT'S A CONCERN WHICH ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE CERTAINLY. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WON'T FIND ANY INSTITUTION OR
YOU1000000186_S0000129	AND YOU WILL IF YOU REALLY ARE INTERESTED.
YOU1000000186_S0000131	THAT'S NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
YOU1000000186_S0000132	SO BILL GATES, WHEN YOU MEET INDIAN ENTREPRENEURS, BILLIONAIRES, ARE YOU GETTING ANY TRACTION WITH THEM THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO DONATE TO THE SECOND MIRACLE OF VACCINES?
YOU1000000186_S0000133	WELL, I'M SURE THAT PHILANTHROPY IN INDIA WILL CONTINUE TO GROW.
YOU1000000186_S0000134	I THINK THERE'S AN AWARENESS THAT ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO A LOT, THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE.
YOU1000000186_S0000135	WHETHER IT'S GOOD SCHOOLS SHOWING THE WAY ON THAT, WITH PEOPLE LIKE
YOU1000000186_S0000137	WHO I THINK DO AN AMAZING JOB AND I'M SURE THERE'S OTHERS OUT THERE LIKE THAT.
YOU1000000186_S0000138	IN AGRICULTURE, THERE'S
YOU1000000186_S0000140	YOU KNOW, GETTING SMART YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING OUT THERE, PUSHING INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES.
YOU1000000186_S0000141	AND SO, YES, PHILANTHROPY IS GOING TO GROW. THE ONLY THING I DO IS I, AS PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PHILANTHROPY, I SHARE WITH THEM HOW MUCH FUN IT CAN BE.
YOU1000000186_S0000142	AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE FACT THAT AS YOU MOVE FROM THE PLACE THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL, USUALLY IN BUSINESS, YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.
YOU1000000186_S0000143	BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN AN AREA WHERE THE MEASURES ARE NOT AS CLEAR.
YOU1000000186_S0000144	AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE 20 OR 30 YEAR PERIOD OF EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE TERRITORY.
YOU1000000186_S0000145	YOU WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AT LEAST TO SHOW THE WAY ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO IT'S TRICKY.
YOU1000000186_S0000146	I THINK ONE OF THE EARLIEST PHILANTHROPISTS ANYWHERE WAS THE TATA FAMILY.
YOU1000000186_S0000147	THEY WERE ACTUALLY A FEW YEARS, EVEN BEFORE ROCKEFELLER AND CARNEGIE.
YOU1000000186_S0000148	AND I LEARNED A LOT FROM THOSE EARLY FOUNDATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE PRETTY BRILLIANT IN WHAT THEY DID.
YOU1000000186_S0000149	YES.
YOU1000000186_S0000150	AND I THINK THE MORE PEOPLE GIVE, THE MORE AWESOME PREMJIS THERE ARE, THE MORE IT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE THINK, OKAY, SHOULD I DO THE SAME?
YOU1000000186_S0000151	AND SO I HOPE.
YOU1000000186_S0000153	THAT 10 YEARS FROM NOW WE CAN SAY THAT THIS WAS THE GOLDEN ERA OF PHILANTHROPY IN INDIA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
YOU1000000186_S0000154	AND YOU DO FIND SOME TRACTION WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM.
YOU1000000186_S0000155	ABSOLUTELY, THE INTEREST IN DISCUSSION IS VERY STRONG. IN FACT, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND PEOPLE ARE FINDING THEIR WAY.
YOU1000000186_S0000156	THAT BOUNDARY OF HOW YOU CONNECT AND SHOW MODELS FOR THE GOVERNMENT, SOME CAPACITY BUILDING IS TAKING PLACE.
YOU1000000186_S0000157	THE US IS, IN THIS RESPECT, FURTHER DOWN THE LEARNING CURVE. THERE'S NO LACK OF PLACES TO GIVE.
YOU1000000186_S0000158	AND TO SOME DEGREE, THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO REACH OUT A LITTLE MORE AND SAY, OKAY, HERE'S A PROGRAM THAT YOU COULD FUND.
YOU1000000186_S0000159	THEY SHOULD LOOK AT HOW THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE US, WHICH IS
YOU1000000186_S0000161	VERY ORGANIZED, BEAUTIFULLY ORGANIZED UNIVERSITIES IN AMERICA.
YOU1000000187_S0000001	SO WHEN I WAS TEACHING, THIS WAS ONE OF THE TESTS I WOULD ASK, YOU KNOW, HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE AN ARTIST? THAT'S THE MAIN QUESTION.
YOU1000000187_S0000002	TO KNOW AN ARTIST OR NOT IS LIKE BREATHING. YOU DON'T QUESTION BREATHING. YOU HAVE TO BREATHE, OTHERWISE YOU JUST DIE. SO YOU BREATHE. SO IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
YOU1000000187_S0000003	AND YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM AND THIS BECOMES LIKE A KIND OF ALMOST OBSESSION AND YOU HAVE TO CREATE AND YOU HAVE THIS URGE TO CREATE. YOU'RE DEFINITELY AN ARTIST.
YOU1000000187_S0000004	BUT YOU'RE NOT A GREAT ARTIST, YOU'RE JUST AN ARTIST. TO BE A GREAT ARTIST, THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF RULES. AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO...
YOU1000000187_S0000005	YOU HAVE TO KIND OF, IT'S LIKE HE OBSESSED YOU, IT'S LIKE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE IN YOUR MIND.
YOU1000000187_S0000006	THE ONLY ADVICE YOU EVER HEAR IS SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW AND IT JUST GETS CONFIRMED. IF YOU THINK OF ALL THE ADVICE THAT YOU'VE HEARD, 50 MILLION PIECES OF ADVICE PEOPLE...
YOU1000000187_S0000007	AND THERE MAY BE THREE OR FOUR PIECES OF ADVICE YOU CAN THINK OF HAVING TAKEN.
YOU1000000187_S0000008	WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG, WILLIAM BURROUGHS TOLD ME, I WAS REALLY STRUGGLING, WE NEVER HAD ANY MONEY.
YOU1000000187_S0000009	AND THE ADVICE THAT WILLIAM GAVE ME WAS BUILD A GOOD NAME. KEEP YOUR NAME CLEAN.
YOU1000000187_S0000010	DON'T MAKE COMPROMISES. DON'T WORRY ABOUT MAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY OR BEING SUCCESSFUL. BE CONCERNED WITH DOING GOOD WORK.
YOU1000000187_S0000011	AND MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES AND PROTECT YOUR WORK. AND IF YOU BUILD A GOOD NAME, EVENTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THAT NAME WILL BE ITS OWN CURRENCY.
YOU1000000187_S0000012	THE ONLY ADVICE I HAVE IS PROBABLY THINGS THAT A LOT OF YOUNG MUSICIANS AND ARTISTS ALREADY KNOW.
YOU1000000187_S0000014	ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE THE AMBITION TO BE THE NEXT JAY Z OR THE NEXT WHATEVER.
YOU1000000187_S0000015	WHATEVER IT IS. THE NUMBER OF THOSE ARTISTS ARE VERY, VERY SMALL.
YOU1000000187_S0000017	AND OFTEN THE ARTISTS WHO ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL THAT WAY
YOU1000000187_S0000019	THEY
YOU1000000187_S0000021	THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH FLEXIBILITY. IN ACHIEVING SUCCESS, THEY KIND OF LOSE A LOT OF THEIR CREATIVE FREEDOM.
YOU1000000187_S0000022	THEY HAVE TO KEEP MAKING THE SAME THING MORE OR LESS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THAT IF THE MUSICIAN OR ARTIST VALUES THEIR FREEDOM AND THEIR
YOU1000000187_S0000023	THE ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE, THEN THEY HAVE TO MAYBE REALIZE THAT THEY WON'T BE MAKING
YOU1000000187_S0000025	HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY MIGHT BE MAKING LESS MONEY, BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE MORE ARTISTIC SATISFACTION.
YOU1000000187_S0000027	PAINTER, PHOTOGRAPHER, FILMMAKER, VIDEO ARTIST, WHATEVER YOU DO.
YOU1000000187_S0000029	NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THAT BETTER THAN YOU.
YOU1000000187_S0000031	I THINK THE THING IS WE'RE NOT, WE CAN'T IMPART ANY KIND OF WISDOM TO ANYONE ELSE. WE'RE SO IMMERSED IN THE BULLSHIT OF OUR OWN ACTIVITIES.
YOU1000000187_S0000032	TO KNOW EVEN HOW TO GIVE ANYONE ADVICE.
YOU1000000187_S0000034	MY ADVICE TO YOUNGER ARTISTS WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE
YOU1000000187_S0000036	TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO WHERE THEY ARE, IN WHAT TIMES, IN WHAT PART OF THE WORLD, AND HOW THAT
YOU1000000187_S0000038	CONSTITUTES THE ARTISTIC PRACTICE, THE ARTISTIC INQUIRY.
YOU1000000187_S0000040	I THINK THE GREAT ARTISTS HAVE TO BE READY TO FAIL, WHICH NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE DO, BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SUCCESS...
YOU1000000187_S0000041	IN A CERTAIN WAY, THEN THE PUBLIC ACCEPTS YOU IN A CERTAIN WAY. YOU START SOMEHOW INVOLUNTARILY REPRODUCING THE SAME IMAGES, THE SAME TYPE OF WORK.
YOU1000000187_S0000042	AND YOU'RE NOT RISKING. AND THE REAL ARTISTS ALWAYS CHANGE THEIR TERRITORIES AND THEY GO TO THE LAND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN.
YOU1000000187_S0000043	IS UNKNOWN TERRITORY AND THEN YOU CAN FAIL AND YOU CAN RISK AND THAT FAILURE ACTUALLY IS WHAT MAKES THIS THIS EXTRA.
YOU1000000187_S0000044	YOU KNOW, READY TO FAIL. THAT MAKES GREAT ARTISTS.
YOU1000000187_S0000046	SO IT'S NOT THAT THERE ISN'T THINGS TO SAY TO ARTISTS, BUT UNLESS THERE ARE THE SPECIFIC THINGS THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR, IT'S...
YOU1000000187_S0000048	IT'S NOT WORTH THEIR WHILE LISTENING OR YOUR WORTH YOUR WHILE TELLING THEM. SO I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC INTERACTION OF THE PERSON GIVING THE ADVICE AND THE PERSON RECEIVING IT RATHER THAN.
YOU1000000187_S0000049	BROAD NOSTRILS. WORK HARD.
YOU1000000187_S0000051	DO YOUR BEST. DO WHAT YOU LIKE AND PEOPLE WILL RESPECT YOU FOR IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SUBJECT YOU TAKE ON. IN THE END, WHATEVER YOU DO IS GOING TO BE A SELF PORTRAIT. IT WILL REVEAL WHO YOU ARE.
YOU1000000187_S0000052	IF IT'S ARROGANT, IT'S ABOUT YOU. IF IT'S PRETENTIOUS, THAT'S ABOUT YOU. DON'T THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE YOURSELF BY YOUR CHOICE OF SUBJECT MATTER.
YOU1000000187_S0000053	THERE ARE MANY THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ONE CAN SAY, BUT UNLESS SOMEONE IS NEEDING THOSE WORDS,
YOU1000000187_S0000055	THEY DON'T GET HURT.
YOU1000000187_S0000056	MAKE YOUR OWN WAY IN THE WORLD.
YOU1000000187_S0000057	WRAP UP WARM, EAT PROPERLY, SENSIBLY.
YOU1000000187_S0000058	DON'T SMOKE. AND FIND YOUR MUM.
YOU1000000187_S0000059	FUNNY BRO.
YOU1000000187_S0000061	I HAD A VERY OLD PROFESSOR, REALLY, WHICH I LOVE VERY MUCH, AND HE GAVE ME TWO ADVICES. HE SAID TO ME, IF YOU ARE DRAWING WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND,
YOU1000000187_S0000062	AND YOU'RE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND BECOME VIRTUOSIC SO THAT YOU WILL DO IT WITH CLOSED EYES.
YOU1000000187_S0000064	YOU CAN DRAW ANYTHING YOU WANT, IMMEDIATELY CHANGE TO THE LEFT HAND. AND THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT ADVICE BECAUSE WHEN YOU BECOME A ROUTINE, THAT IS THE END OF EVERYTHING.
YOU1000000187_S0000065	AND THE SECOND GREAT ADVICE HE SAID TO ME, YOU KNOW IN YOUR LIFETIME YOU PROBABLY WILL HAVE ONE GOOD IDEA IF YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD ARTIST.
YOU1000000187_S0000066	AND IF YOU'RE A GENIUS, TWO GOOD IDEAS. AND THAT'S IT. BUT BE CAREFUL WITH THAT.
YOU1000000187_S0000067	DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT YOU KNOW DEEP IN YOUR HEART SOMEBODY ELSE CAN DO BETTER, BUT DO WHAT NOBODY ELSE CAN DO EXCEPT FOR YOU.
YOU1000000187_S0000069	WHAT I THINK THE BEST ADVICE IS, I THINK WORKING WITH ART IS WORKING WITH SOMETHING THAT IS VERY FIERCE, VERY STRONG, VERY ROBUST.
YOU1000000187_S0000071	AND...
YOU1000000187_S0000073	EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMS TO SAY THAT ART IS FRAGILE, SHOULD BE MARGINALIZED, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, IT'S...
YOU1000000187_S0000074	DOESN'T BELONG TO THE CENTER OF WHAT REALITY IS DEFINED AS. ARTISTS SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE FACT THAT WELL MAKING
YOU1000000187_S0000076	A DRAWING ON A PIECE OF PAPER IS CHANGING THE WORLD.
YOU1000000187_S0000078	BY DEFINITION, MAKING ART IS MAKING THE WORLD. SO IT IS AN UNBELIEVABLY REWARDING THING TO BE AN ARTIST.
YOU1000000187_S0000079	AND TO BE FULL BEHIND THAT IDEA AS A YOUNG ARTIST AND TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT HAVING CHOSEN THE, IN MANY PERSPECTIVES, STRANGE CHOICE TO BECOME AN ARTIST,
YOU1000000187_S0000080	IS ALSO TO HAVE CHOSEN TO BE A PART OF THE WORLD.
YOU1000000187_S0000081	TO BE AN ARTIST, ACTUALLY TO BE A HUMAN BEING IN THESE TIMES, IT'S ALL DIFFICULT. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH LIFE, HOPEFULLY,
YOU1000000187_S0000082	YOU KNOW, TRYING TO STAY HEALTHY, YOU KNOW, BEING AS HAPPY AS YOU CAN AND PURSUING, YOU KNOW, DOING WHAT YOU WANT.
YOU1000000187_S0000083	IF WHAT YOU WANT IS TO HAVE CHILDREN, IF WHAT YOU WANT IS TO BE A BAKER, IF WHAT YOU WANT IS TO LIVE OUT IN THE WOODS OR TRY TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT.
YOU1000000187_S0000084	OR MAYBE WHAT YOU WANT IS TO WRITE SCRIPTS FOR DETECTIVE SHOWS. IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, YOU KNOW. WHAT MATTERS IS TO BE, IS TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,
YOU1000000187_S0000085	AND PURSUE IT AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE LIFE IS REALLY DIFFICULT.
YOU1000000187_S0000086	YOU'RE GONNA LOSE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. YOU'RE GONNA SUFFER HEARTBREAK. SOMETIMES YOU'LL BE SICK. SOMETIMES YOU'LL HAVE A REALLY BAD TOOTHACHE.
YOU1000000187_S0000087	SOMETIMES YOU'LL BE HUNGRY BUT ON THE OTHER END YOU'LL HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCES SOMETIMES JUST THE SKY
YOU1000000187_S0000088	SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, A PIECE OF WORK THAT YOU DO THAT FEELS SO WONDERFUL, OR YOU FIND SOMEBODY TO LOVE, OR YOUR CHILDREN, OR...
YOU1000000187_S0000089	THERE'S BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN LIFE. SO WHEN YOU'RE SUFFERING, JUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S PART OF THE PACKAGE. YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT IT, WE'RE BORN.
YOU1000000187_S0000090	AND WE ALSO HAVE TO DIE. WE KNOW THAT. SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE REALLY HAPPY AND THINGS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY FUCKED UP TOO.
YOU1000000188_S0000001	ONE OF THE OLDEST ART FORMS, PAINTING HAS BEEN AROUND EVER SINCE OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS FIRST STARTED PRODUCING CHARCOAL CREATIONS ON CAVE WALLS.
YOU1000000188_S0000002	WHILE COUNTLESS GENERATIONS OF ARTISTS HAVE LEFT THEIR MARK OVER THE MILLENNIA, ONLY SOME ARTWORKS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN TRANSCENDING TIME AND CULTURE TO BE REVERED AROUND THE GLOBE.
YOU1000000188_S0000003	HERE'S A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS PAINTINGS OF ALL TIME FOUND IN MUSEUMS AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU1000000188_S0000005	NUMBER 12. AMERICAN GOTHIC. NOW HANGING UP IN THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO,
YOU1000000188_S0000006	AMERICAN GOTHIC IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PAINTINGS OF 20TH CENTURY RURAL AMERICANA.
YOU1000000188_S0000007	GRANT WOOD'S DEFINING MASTERPIECE WAS PAINTED IN 1930 AND DEPICTS A FARMER AND HIS DAUGHTER STANDING IN FRONT OF WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE AMERICAN GOTHIC HOUSE.
YOU1000000188_S0000008	INITIALLY, LOCALS AND ART CRITICS TOOK THE SOMBER TONES AND CHARACTERS' PURITANICAL CLOTHES AS A CRITIQUE OF RURAL LIFE.
YOU1000000188_S0000009	THE ONSET OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION, HOWEVER, SAW THE PAINTING BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESOLUTENESS AND INDOMITABLE SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN PIONEERS.
YOU1000000188_S0000011	NUMBER 11. THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY. ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST DISTINCTIVE WORKS OF SURREALIST ART OF ALL TIME,
YOU1000000188_S0000012	SALVADOR DALI'S THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY REALLY DOES STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD.
YOU1000000188_S0000013	IN THE 1931 PAINTING, WE CAN SEE MELTING POCKET WATCHES DRAPED ACROSS A BLEAK LANDSCAPE.
YOU1000000188_S0000014	THE STRANGE SCENE IS WIDELY THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY.
YOU1000000188_S0000015	DALI'S FANTASTIC CREATION CAN BE ENJOYED AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IN NEW YORK.
YOU1000000188_S0000017	NUMBER 10. THE KISS. PAINTED BETWEEN 1907 AND 1908 DURING THE HEIGHT OF GUSTAV KLIMT'S GOLDEN PERIOD,
YOU1000000188_S0000018	THE KISS VERITABLY SHIMMERS AND SHINES BEFORE YOUR EYES AS GOLD, SILVER, AND PLATINUM RADIATE FORTH FROM THE CANVAS.
YOU1000000188_S0000019	INFLUENCED BY BOTH THE ARTS AND CRAFTS AND ART NOUVEAU MOVEMENTS, THE PAINTING DEPICTS TWO GOLD CLAD LOVERS ENTWINED IN AN INTIMATE EMBRACE.
YOU1000000188_S0000020	JUST ONE OF THE MANY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BELVEDERE IN VIENNA'S EXTENSIVE COLLECTION, THE KISS IS KLIMT'S MOST POPULAR AND ENTHRALLING WORK.
YOU1000000188_S0000022	NUMBER 9. NIGHTHAWKS. ANOTHER OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO'S MOST FAMOUS ARTWORKS IS NIGHTHAWKS,
YOU1000000188_S0000023	WHICH WAS PAINTED BY EDWARD HOPPER IN 1942. IN THE OIL PAINTING, WE CAN SEE FOUR PEOPLE IN A DINER LATE AT NIGHT.
YOU1000000188_S0000024	LIGHT SHINES OUT OF THE BRIGHTLY LIT INTERIOR, ILLUMINATING THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THROUGH THE LARGE GLASS WINDOW.

YOU1000000188_S0000043	FOR MUCH OF ITS EXISTENCE, THE PAINTING WAS COATED WITH A DARK VARNISH, WHICH GAVE THE INCORRECT IMPRESSION THAT IT DEPICTED A NIGHT SCENE.
YOU1000000188_S0000044	LEADING TO THE NAME NIGHTWATCH. THE PAINTING IS FAMED FOR ITS DRAMATIC USE OF LIGHT THAT MAKES IT SEEM AS IF THE LIFE SIZE FIGURES ARE ACTUALLY MOVING BEFORE US.

YOU1000000189_S0000000	TODAY WE ARE VISITING TRUE GARDEN. IT'S A VERTICAL AEROPONIC FOOD FARM. I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO GO HERE BECAUSE
YOU1000000189_S0000001	BECAUSE I ORIGINALLY STUMBLED ACROSS TRUE GARDEN AND THEIR FARM ON INSTAGRAM AND IT'S SO COOL LOOKING. IT'S JUST A SERIES OF COLUMNS.
YOU1000000189_S0000002	THAT ARE COVERED IN DIFFERENT VEGETABLES AND FRUITS THAT ARE COMPLETELY FRESH. AND I WAS MOSTLY INTERESTED TO SEE
YOU1000000189_S0000003	WHAT THE BIOLOGY OF GROWING FOOD WAS LIKE BECAUSE VERTICAL FARMS GROW FOOD IN A VERY DIFFERENT AND SUSTAINABLE WAY.
YOU1000000189_S0000004	MY NAME IS TROY ALBRIGHT. I'M ACTUALLY A LICENSED PHARMACIST. AS I'VE DONE CONSULTS ON MY PATIENTS, I REALIZE IT STARTS WITH THE FOOD THEY'RE PUTTING IN THEIR BODY.
YOU1000000189_S0000005	TROY IS A LICENSED PHARMACIST BY TRADE. HE WENT THROUGH SCHOOL IN THE VERY MODERN MEDICAL WAY OF DOING THINGS.
YOU1000000189_S0000006	AND THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HAVING CHILDREN OF HIS OWN WITH THEIR OWN ILLNESSES AND CONDITIONS AND ALSO BEING OVERWEIGHT HIMSELF.
YOU1000000189_S0000007	HE CHANGED HOW HE APPROACHED FOOD AND WHAT HE PUT IN HIS BODY, AND IT CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY.
YOU1000000189_S0000008	MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WERE FARMERS IN MINNESOTA AND WE HAD BLACK SOIL THERE. HERE IN ARIZONA THE SOIL IS LIKE THIS RED CLAY STUFF.
YOU1000000189_S0000009	SURE.
YOU1000000189_S0000010	SO IF YOU DON'T AMEND IT AND REALLY WORK THAT SOIL, YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF GOOD QUALITY PRODUCE OUT OF IT. SO WHEN I SAW THE TOWER GARDEN, I CAN CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENT.
YOU1000000189_S0000011	I CONTROL THE WATER, I CONTROL THE NUTRIENTS. I LOVE THIS, I CAN CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF GROWING MY OWN FOOD.
YOU1000000189_S0000012	SO HOW DOES THIS WHOLE PROCESS WORK? BASICALLY, THE FIRST STEP IS TO PUT WHATEVER SEEDS YOU WANT INTO THE COCONUT COIR.
YOU1000000189_S0000013	THIS GROW MEDIUM HERE IS COCO CORE. IT'S ACTUALLY A CERTIFIED ORGANIC GROW MEDIUM AND IT'S A BYPRODUCT OF COCONUT HUSK. AND YOU THROW IT, PUT YOUR SEEDS IN THERE.
YOU1000000189_S0000014	AND THEN ONCE THEY'RE ONE TO TWO INCHES TALL LIKE THIS, WE CAN COME OVER HERE AND JUST PLANT THESE RIGHT IN HERE. THEY FIT RIGHT IN THE POD.
YOU1000000189_S0000015	YOU THROW IT IN, THE PUMP TURNS ON EVERY 3 TO 15 MINUTES DEPENDING ON THE PROGRAM, PUMPS THE WATER AND THE NUTRIENT SOLUTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP, AND THEN JUST USING THE LAW OF PHYSICS.
YOU1000000189_S0000016	YEAH.
YOU1000000189_S0000017	WHAT GOES UP COMES DOWN, RIGHT?
YOU1000000189_S0000018	YEAH.
YOU1000000189_S0000019	AND IT JUST RAINS DOWN, THERE'S A SHOWER CAP, RAINS DOWN AND HITS ALL THESE SPOTS.
YOU1000000189_S0000020	SO SOMETHING I FIND INTERESTING IS THAT YOU ONLY NEED THAT AMOUNT OF SOIL.
YOU1000000189_S0000021	LIKE
YOU1000000189_S0000022	LIKE YOU ENVISION JUST MILES AND MILES OF DIRT AND SOIL TO GROW PLANTS, BUT YOU ONLY NEED THAT AMOUNT?
YOU1000000189_S0000023	YEP, THAT'S ALL I NEED.
YOU1000000189_S0000024	FOR EVERY DIFFERENT PLANT THAT YOU'RE GROWING.
YOU1000000189_S0000025	NOPE, JUST THAT SMALL AMOUNT. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT EVEN SOIL. IT'S COCONUT HUSK. IF WE USE SOIL, WE'D HAVE A LOT MORE BUGS. WE'D HAVE TO USE PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES AND FUNGICIDES. I CHOOSE NOT TO USE ANY OF THOSE HERE.
YOU1000000189_S0000026	ORGANIC IS WHAT? JUST FOOD.
YOU1000000189_S0000027	YEAH.
YOU1000000189_S0000028	DO YOU THINK THAT'S REALLY HAPPENING TODAY?
YOU1000000189_S0000029	WELL, BY THE WAY, YOU JUST SAID THAT NOW.
YOU1000000189_S0000031	VEGETABLES TYPICALLY THAT ARE TRANSPORTED INTO YOUR STATE BY LAW, EVEN IF THEY'RE ORGANIC, ARE SPRAYED WITH PESTICIDES.
YOU1000000189_S0000032	SO THAT'S NOT IDEAL.
YOU1000000189_S0000033	THE PROBLEM IS OUR SOILS ARE DEPLETED. THE FDA HAS LOTS OF STUDIES SHOWING THAT WHEN THOSE LEAFY GREENS ARE CUT, THEY TRAVEL WHAT, ON AVERAGE, 1,200 TO 1,500 MILES TO GET TO YOUR PLATE.
YOU1000000189_S0000034	THEY COME ACROSS PESTICIDES.
YOU1000000189_S0000035	YEAH, PESTICIDES ARE 50% LESS NUTRIENTS. THEY'VE LOST UP TO 50%. IN SOME CASES, THERE'S HARDLY ANY NUTRITIONAL VALUE.
YOU1000000189_S0000037	HERE LOOK AT SOME OF THIS BASIL. LET'S GRAB A BEAUTIFUL BASIL PLANT. PULL THIS OUT. LOOK AT THOSE BEAUTIFUL ROOTS ON THERE.
YOU1000000189_S0000038	OH MY GOSH.
YOU1000000189_S0000039	I MEAN LOOK AT THAT
YOU1000000189_S0000040	THAT'S INSANE!
YOU1000000189_S0000041	THIS IS 21 DAYS OLD. YEAH.
YOU1000000189_S0000042	THE VEGETABLES THAT WE SAW AT TRUE GARDEN WERE JUST GROWING RIGHT THERE. THERE WAS NO SOIL. THERE WAS MINIMAL WATER.
YOU1000000189_S0000043	IT WAS REALLY JUST THEIR ROOTS HANGING IN THESE HOLLOW TUBES, BEING SATURATED IN NUTRIENT DENSE SUBSTANCES AND GROWING TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VEGETABLES.
YOU1000000189_S0000044	IF WE PULL ONE OUT HERE, IT'S LIKE A BEAUTIFUL BOUQUET. LET'S GET ONE OUT OF HERE SO YOU CAN SEE. I MEAN THE ROOTS, YOU GOT THESE BEAUTIFUL ROOTS.
YOU1000000189_S0000045	NOW I KNOW WHAT MY BOUQUET IS GOING TO BE FOR MY WEDDING.
YOU1000000189_S0000046	YES.
YOU1000000189_S0000047	OH MY GOSH, IT'S SO SOFT.
YOU1000000189_S0000048	YEAH, ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? WHY DON'T YOU TRY A PIECE OF THAT?
YOU1000000189_S0000049	VEGETABLES HAVE A MUCH MORE VIBRANT AND BOLDER AND FULLER FLAVOR THAN I THINK MOST OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED.
YOU1000000189_S0000050	I FEEL LIKE IT TASTES DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M USED TO. LIKE I FEEL LIKE MOST ROMAINE LETTUCE TASTES SO WATERED DOWN.
YOU1000000189_S0000051	SUMMER'S OVER, THIS IS EVEN BETTER.
YOU1000000189_S0000052	I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE EVER TASTED ROMAINE THAT WAS THIS SWEET. IT'S STRONGER. IT'S MORE UNIQUE FROM VEGETABLE TO VEGETABLE.
YOU1000000189_S0000053	BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT DIRT FLAVOR. A LOT OF THAT COMES FROM GROWING THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLE IN THIS COCONUT HUSK
YOU1000000189_S0000054	AND FEEDING IT WITH THESE NUTRIENT SUBSTANCES WITHOUT ANY SOIL. IT'S AMAZING.
YOU1000000189_S0000055	I DON'T KNOW HOW I HAVEN'T EATEN VEGETABLES THIS FRESH BEFORE AND I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE NEEDS TO. LIKE I BUY EXPENSIVE FREAKING SPINACH AT THE STORE.
YOU1000000189_S0000056	ALL ORGANIC, EVERYTHING. WHOLE PAYCHECK AT WHOLE FOODS, IT HAPPENS. BUT IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE THIS.
YOU1000000189_S0000057	WHEN THEY GROW MOST SPINACH IN SANDS, A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU CRUNCH ON SPINACH,
YOU1000000189_S0000058	YOU GOT LIKE A GRAINY TASTE TO THAT.
YOU1000000189_S0000059	THAT'S THE SAND THAT THEY GROW IT IN, SO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO RINSE IT WELL AND GET RID OF THAT.
YOU1000000189_S0000060	ONE OF THE CRAZIEST THINGS I TRIED WAS THE STEVIA LEAF.
YOU1000000189_S0000061	HERE, TRY JUST A PIECE OF THIS. OKAY, JUST A REALLY SMALL AMOUNT.
YOU1000000189_S0000065	WHAT IS THAT?
YOU1000000189_S0000066	IT'S A NATURAL PLANT SWEETENER.
YOU1000000189_S0000067	I JUST WANT TO EAT THIS AS LIKE AN AFTER DINNER DESSERT AND THEN I WILL NEVER EAT ICE CREAM AGAIN.
YOU1000000189_S0000068	IT'S NOT I MEAN THAT'S SO SWEET, ISN'T IT?
YOU1000000189_S0000069	YEAH, I HAVE HAD THE STEVIA POWDER BUT NEVER A STEVIA LEAF. OH, THAT IS STEVIA
YOU1000000189_S0000070	THIS IS THE ACTUAL STEVIA PLANT HERE.
YOU1000000189_S0000071	WOW, THAT'S AMAZING. YOU COULD USE IT IN SO MANY THINGS AND IT IS SO POWERFUL. I ALSO TRIED A MINT CHOCOLATE HERB.
YOU1000000189_S0000072	AND IT TASTED JUST LIKE MINT CHOCOLATE.
YOU1000000189_S0000073	SO ONCE WE HAVE A SPROUT, WE PUT IT IN THE TOWER, 26 DAYS LATER YOU HAVE THAT. THINGS GROW SUPER FAST.
YOU1000000189_S0000074	26 DAYS.
YOU1000000189_S0000075	YES.
YOU1000000189_S0000077	SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET ACCELERATED GROWTH BECAUSE THE ROOTS CAN GET A LOT OF OXYGEN.
YOU1000000189_S0000079	SINCE THERE'S NO SOIL, THERE'S NO WEEDS, WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE POOLING WEEDS IS LITERALLY THE WORST WEEKEND ACTIVITY EVER.
YOU1000000189_S0000080	VERTICAL FARMING, IT'S JUST YOUR HEAD OF LETTUCE, OR YOUR KALE, OR YOUR SPINACH, OR YOUR BERRIES, OR YOUR TOMATOES. NO BUGS, NO WEEDS.
YOU1000000189_S0000081	WHAT IS THE ACTUAL BENEFIT OF HAVING A VERTICAL FARM VERSUS HAVING A NORMAL FARM THAT WE'RE USED TO SEEING?
YOU1000000189_S0000082	BIG PART OF IT IS WITH A VERTICAL FARM WE'RE REALLY SAVING ON SPACE. WE CAN USE 90% LESS LAND BUT WE CAN GROW 90% MORE FOOD.
YOU1000000189_S0000083	WHEN YOU GO VERTICAL LIKE THIS, THIS IS ONE TENTH OF AN ACRE. WE CAN GROW TEN TIMES MORE FOOD AS A RESULT OF GOING VERTICAL.
YOU1000000189_S0000084	PLUS OUR RESOURCES, WE USE 90 TO 98% LESS WATER. THAT'S HUGE. I MEAN, WHAT, 3% OF THE WATER IN THE WORLD IS FRESH WATER?
YOU1000000189_S0000085	SO IT'S NOT JUST A COMMODITY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVING FRESH WATER. SO WE GOT TO REALLY CONSERVE OUR RESOURCES AND IF WE DON'T...
YOU1000000189_S0000086	WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR MAJOR CATASTROPHE.
YOU1000000189_S0000087	HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD FEED JUST OUT OF THIS SPACE?
YOU1000000189_S0000088	OUT OF THIS SPACE, WE COULD EASILY FEED, GOSH, 100 FAMILIES ON A WEEKLY BASIS.
YOU1000000189_S0000089	WOW. AS WE ALL KNOW, OUR WORLD IS CHANGING. THE LAND AVAILABLE TO US IS CHANGING. THE QUALITY SOIL THAT WE HAVE ON OUR EARTH IS CHANGING.
YOU1000000189_S0000090	AND THIS MAY BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY TO FEED OUR COMMUNITIES MOVING FORWARD.
YOU1000000189_S0000091	WHAT WOULD BE YOUR TOP THREE TIPS FOR DOING THAT?
YOU1000000189_S0000092	GROW THE THINGS YOU LOVE TO EAT, KEEP IT SIMPLE, USE CLEAN WATER, USE GOOD QUALITY SEEDLINGS. WE'VE GOT RESIDENTIAL MODELS.
YOU1000000189_S0000093	AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL FARMS.
YOU1000000189_S0000094	MODEL.
YOU1000000189_S0000095	SO THE RESIDENTIAL MODEL IS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET TALL, JUST LIKE YOU ARE. AND ONE TO TWO TOWERS COULD EASILY FEED A FAMILY OF FOUR, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE GROWING.
YOU1000000189_S0000096	YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO LESS CHEMICALS. YOU'LL LOVE IT. YOU'LL REALLY LOVE IT.
YOU1000000189_S0000097	I WAS A SKEPTIC. I ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT THE BIOLOGY OF THIS FOOD MUST BE DIFFERENT IF WE'RE NOT MAKING IT WITH SOIL AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER.
YOU1000000189_S0000098	AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT AS THE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS WE'RE USED TO. BUT THE MATTER OF THE FACT IS, IT'S BETTER. IT'S GOT MORE NUTRIENTS, MORE MINERALS.
YOU1000000189_S0000099	IT'S MORE DENSE IN THE RICH VITAMINS THAT YOUR BODY NEEDS AND IT'S JUST MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.
YOU1000000189_S0000100	YOU KNOW, AS A COMPOUNDING PHARMACIST, I DO CONSULTS AND I GOT INTO THIS BECAUSE I REALLY SAW NOT JUST MY OWN KIDS, BUT MY OWN PATIENTS THAT WERE MISSING THE FOOD PART.
YOU1000000189_S0000101	THEY WERE MISSING THAT NUTRITION PART AND AS I CORRECTED NUTRITION IN THEM, I'M LIKE, OH MY, THIS CHANGED THEIR WHOLE LIFE.
YOU1000000189_S0000102	WE WERE TAUGHT IN PHARMACY SCHOOL JUST GIVE A DRUG, GIVE A DRUG, GIVE A DRUG. DRUGS ARE JUST BAND AIDS. THEY DON'T CURE US. IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD NUTRITION,
YOU1000000189_S0000103	THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUR BODY ON ISN'T THERE, AND SO THAT LEADS TO ALL SORTS OF THINGS, YOU KNOW, DEPRESSION, LEAKY GUT, GUM DISEASE.
YOU1000000189_S0000104	PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING HEADACHES, THEY'RE NOT GROWING PROPERLY. OUR KIDS DON'T GROW PROPERLY BECAUSE OF NUTRITION. SO IT STARTS WITH GOOD FOUNDATION.
YOU1000000189_S0000105	IF YOU HAVE A GOOD FOUNDATION WITH NUTRITION, EAT IT, WATCH YOU GROW OR BUY IT LOCALLY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE WAY HEALTHIER.
YOU1000000189_S0000106	IT'S SO CRAZY HOW YOUR DIET CAN AFFECT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. IT'S HARD TO PUT INTO A SENTENCE HOW COOL AND INTERESTING I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS.
YOU1000000189_S0000107	I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FIRM BELIEVER IN WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY MATTERS AND THE FOOD YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY MATTERS.
YOU1000000189_S0000108	AND WE ARE ALLOWING FOOD INDUSTRIES TO SPRAY IT WITH PESTICIDES, TO TRANSPORT IT SUPER FAR, CHANGE ITS ENZYMES AND NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS.
YOU1000000189_S0000109	SO THAT WHEN WE'RE RECEIVING THE FOOD, IT'S NOT EVEN GIVING US THE FUEL THAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE IN A HEALTHY WAY.
YOU1000000189_S0000110	THE BODY IS AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, MACHINERY. YOU PUT GOOD STUFF IN, IT GIVES GOOD STUFF OUT. IF YOU PUT BAD STUFF IN, IN TIME, BAD STUFF'S GONNA COME OUT.
YOU1000000189_S0000111	BUT YOU CAN CORRECT IT. IT JUST TAKES SOME EFFORT ON OUR PART TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. WHO SAID THAT IN HIPPOCRATES? YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. LET FOOD BE MEDICINE. LET MEDICINE BE FOOD.
YOU1000000189_S0000112	HE SAID IT A LOT MORE ELOQUENTLY, BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT.
YOU1000000189_S0000113	TRUE GARDEN WAS QUITE POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN. IT WAS PRISTINE. IT WAS GREEN.
YOU1000000189_S0000114	NOT FAKE GREEN, NOT SPRAYED ON GREEN. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL, VIBRANT GREEN.
YOU1000000189_S0000115	AND THE OXYGEN IN THAT GREENHOUSE, I WOULD LIKE TO ONE DAY LIVE IN A GREENHOUSE WITH THAT PURE OXYGEN.
YOU1000000189_S0000116	I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT MY HEALTH, TO LEARN ABOUT MY FOOD, AND ALSO TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH YOU GUYS.
YOU1000000189_S0000118	IN HOPES THAT IT MAYBE CHANGES ONE THING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE EVERYTHING OVERNIGHT. DO ONE THING THAT WILL MAKE YOU BETTER TOMORROW THAN YOU ARE TODAY.
YOU1000000189_S0000120	THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING. IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE VIDEOS TO MAKE AND SHARE WITH YOU ALL. IF YOU CARE ABOUT HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND WANT TO LEARN MORE,
YOU1000000189_S0000121	YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH OUR TUTORIAL ON HOW TO MAKE NATURAL CLEANING SUPPLIES BECAUSE WHAT YOU SPRAY AROUND IN THE AIR AROUND YOU MATTERS TOO.
YOU1000000191_S0000000	SO WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS PLATE ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE. I HAD MY WEETABIX THIS MORNING.
YOU1000000191_S0000001	GOOD MORNING EVERYONE, IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY, DON'T FORGET TO HIT THE SUBSCRIBE BUTTON AND RING THE LITTLE BELL.

YOU1000000191_S0000003	IN TODAY'S VIDEO I AM WALKING INTO MY COW FIELD. WE HAVE MOVED THE ELECTRIC FENCE BACK INTO THIS FIELD AND WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT SOMETHING VERY EXCITING. WE ARE DOING SOMETHING VERY EXCITING TODAY.
YOU1000000191_S0000004	YOU'D HAVE SEEN WHEN WE PUT THE COW BRUSH BACK UP IN JANUARY, IT WAS VERY WET, IT WAS VERY HORRIBLE.
YOU1000000191_S0000005	IT WAS GROSS, BUT THE COWS LOVED THE COW BROS.
YOU1000000191_S0000007	I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO COWS FIGHTING OVER THE BRUSH. SURELY THIS MEANS I NEED ANOTHER ONE.
YOU1000000191_S0000009	THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. YOU'D HAVE SEEN THEM USING IT ALL THE TIME. THIS IS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
YOU1000000191_S0000010	AND THE GUYS AT MAYO COW COMFORT AND FINEASY WOULD LIKE TO SEND ME ANOTHER COW BRUSH.
YOU1000000191_S0000011	BUT THIS COW BRUSH IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. A COW BRUSH THAT GOES INTO THE FIELD.
YOU1000000191_S0000012	SO OBVIOUSLY OUR COWS ARE HAPPILY GRAZING. WE HAVE ABOUT...
YOU1000000191_S0000014	10 STANDING UP AND THE OTHER 110 ARE CHILLING OUT, BELLIES FULL OF GRASS.
YOU1000000191_S0000015	GETTING A BIT OF THAT SUN. OUR PLAN IS THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME A COW BRUSH THAT GOES INTO THE FIELD, WHICH IS GREAT.
YOU1000000191_S0000016	SO INSTEAD OF USING MY BRAND NEW FENCES THAT WE DID FOR A VIEWING AREA BACK AT THE FARM SHOP, WE ARE GOING TO USE A CALVARY, WHICH IS GOING TO BE FANTASTIC.
YOU1000000191_S0000017	I WAS THINKING OF PUTTING IT WITH THE HIGHLANDS THAT ARE IN THE PADDOCK THERE, BUT THEN I THOUGHT WHY GIVE IT A HIGHLANDS WHEN THERE'S ONLY FOUR?
YOU1000000191_S0000018	WHEN WE'VE GOT 123 I THINK IN THE MOMENT IN THE MILKING HERD
YOU1000000191_S0000019	WHY DON'T WE PUT IT IN HERE? SO IT'S GOING TO GET USED LITERALLY 22 TIMES MORE.
YOU1000000191_S0000020	DESMONDO IS COMING SOON AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND A POSITION TO PUT IT UP
YOU1000000191_S0000021	I'M GOING TO GUESS HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE IT IN AN AREA WHERE THE COWS CAN USE IT. PEOPLE CAN SEE IT FROM THE FARM SHOP WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE FARM SHOP AND THEY SEE THE VIEW AND AREA OF THE
YOU1000000191_S0000022	HORSE AND THE ISLAND. MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE COMING AS WELL. YEAH, IT'S VERY EXCITING. SO THAT'S THE IDEA.
YOU1000000191_S0000023	I'M GOING TO PUT A WHITE POLE TO SAY THIS IS WHERE I WOULD LIKE IT.
YOU1000000191_S0000024	THIS IS THE POSITION AND DESMONDO IS COMING IN A MINUTE. DESMONDO, IMAGINE YOU ARE A NORMAL HUMAN. CAN YOU SEE THIS HERE? THIS IS ME PRETENDING TO BE A COW BRUSH.
YOU1000000191_S0000025	DEAD YET?
YOU1000000191_S0000027	ALL WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'VE GOT TO WAIT FOR MALE COW COMFORT TO COME.
YOU1000000191_S0000029	SO WE HAD TWO POSITIONS AND I THINK YOUR EYE DOES TAKE THAT ONE OUT
YOU1000000191_S0000030	IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AWAY.
YOU1000000191_S0000031	DESMOND'S ALWAYS RIGHT.
YOU1000000191_S0000032	I
YOU1000000191_S0000033	JUST ACCEPT IT
YOU1000000191_S0000034	NOT TRUE.

YOU1000000191_S0000036	WE HAVEN'T GOT MARCO AND FINN, UNFORTUNATELY. THEY ARE STILL IN FINLAND WITH THIS WHOLE THING GOING ON.
